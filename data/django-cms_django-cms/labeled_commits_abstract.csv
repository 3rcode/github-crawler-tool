Fix plugin js loading (#6699),0.47325462,Graceful plugin exceptions (#7423),"Added code to load and execute js scripts, with a special class  The special class is 'cms-execute-js-to-render', and the scripts will only be executed if  it wasn't present before. If it also has the class 'cms-execute-js-to-render', the 'load' and 'DOMContentLoaded' will be triggered. Refactored code to add scripts properly in a method Refactored code to only trigger the load events once all is ready Added tests for the 4 combinations of the 2 script classes Since loading behavior of scripts in plugins can be controlled by using this 2 classes Added documentation for the new feature Added myself to AUTHROS and fixed a typo in docs Refactored code to have a more granular control which events get fired Still need to adapt the docs to this changes Adapted documentation to the changes in usable classes fixed small spacing bug in the docs fixed typos and applied style recommendations removed artifact variable 'trigger_window_load_event' and bundled changes replacing 'getMultiScript' with 'Promise.all' as recommended in link Rebased on develop branch and rebundled toolbar",0

Without a try/except block around it, this will cause a loop to prematurely terminate in a seemingly normal way. This is what was happening before this fix, and this effectively caused develop.py makemigrations to only ever make migrations for cms, which is the first appliation in the list. Also, I've added code that will first check to see if an app already has migrations and if not, it will run the equivalent of manage.py schemamigration [app] --initial and emit a notice of the same. Finally, this now detects if an application in the list if not found, and emits a notice of this too.",0

With non-caching template loaders this doesn't matter, but with Django's caching template loader, the same template, with modified nodelist, will be used next time the template is requested. The main issue with this is that blocks inherited from a parent template, and not overridden, appear as though they were copied literally into the child template. Often this doesn't matter, but if the block uses block.super and adds content, then because it's interpreted twice, the added content will appear twice.",0

Originally introduced in commit 61f56dd14751bab4c0232a62afb87555216a67f4 with no rationale. These are the edge cases where it makes a difference, as far as I can tell: It forbids seeing published subpages when all roots are unpublished.   But why the special treatment of roots and not caring about other   intermediary levels? And it checks for any roots regardless of   placement, even if it's in a different hierarchy. It prevents seeing a draft version of a page if there are no draft   versions of any root pages in the site. If that's at all possible, it   seems like a bug?",0

Updated page_url tag to follow design decision,0.35871273,Menu link is outdated when page moved (#7558),"The agreed upon logic is that using the tag without the 'as' breakpoint, uses the backwards compatible logic that will raise a Page.DoesNotExist exception when the page cannot be found AND when settings.DEBUG=True. Using the tag with the 'as' breakpoint will always suppress the Page.DoesNotExist exception regardless of the settings.DEBUG value. Also, to do this cleanly, Ojii has updated django-classy-tags to expose an overridable get_value_for_context() method on AsTag. This bumps up the version required to 0.5 for django-cms.  setup.py and test-requirements/* have been updated to reflect this. Signed-off-by: Martin Koistinen mkoistinen@gmail.com",0

We want to swallow the first but not the second. This commit uses the imp module - imp.find_module() looks for the module and will cause an ImportError if the module does not exist.  But it will not actually run the file code.  So the try/except block is put around imp.find_module().  If there was no ImportError at that point, we then to load_module() outside the try/except block, and if that fails we die here immediately.",0

Until now, the maintainer/content-editors of a site had to do and detect this manually. I propose we add a signal cms.signals.urls_need_reloading which fires when the CMS detects the server needs a restart. This signal is just sent by the django CMS. The core itself does nothing when this signal is sent. However it allows developers to write custom listeners to that signal that take an appropriate action in their envirnment. For some common use cases, there might even be generic implementations (outside djagno-cms core) which solve this issue (eg killing os.getppid in single-server gunicorn systems).",0

No longer allow '+' as related_name in PlaceholderField,0.50768894,Utility function get_placeholder_from_slot for PlaceholderRelationField (#7479),Setting the related_name in a models.fields.PlaceholderField to '+' causes the permission checks on models.Placeholder to fail because models.Placeholder._get_attached_fields which is used by the permission system will not find the attached model. This patch prevents this by simply raising a ValueError if a developer attempts to create a models.fields.PlaceholderField with '+' as related_name. This is documented in extending_cms/placeholders.rst and tested in PlaceholderTestCase.test_placeholder_field_no_related_name.,0

CMS_PERMISSION: optionally use raw id user lookups,0.3635018,Link both user and group from global page permissions to change form (#7486) (6cb47629b) -- Fabian Braun,"The ""view restrictions"" and ""page permissions"" inlines on the ""page"" admin change forms can cause performance problems where there are many thousands of users being put into simple select boxes. Added a new setting (CMS_RAW_ID_USERS) that, if set, forces the inlines on that page to use standard Django admin ""raw ID"" lookups rather than select boxes. The restriction on which users may be selected should still be honoured by the new widget because we set the 'limit_choices_to' attribute to be the same as the queryset on the original widget. Using raw_id_fields in combination with limit_choices_to blows up if you have many thousands of users. For this reason, we only apply this limit if the number of users is relatively small (< 500, though that figure is somewhat arbitrary). If the number of users we need to limit to is greater than that, we use the usual input field instead unless the user is a CMS superuser, in which case we bypass the limit. Unfortunately, this means that non-superusers won't see any benefit from this change.",0

Okay this is a big one:,0.23653702,Bug Fixes:,"I wanted to fix #885, which I did. However it appeared that Page.get_absolute_url was a complete mess. So I ended up fixing that, by moving page-path (url) logic to post-save (Title/Page) signals and compute them there, and store them in Title.path. This means Page.get_absolute_url() should be A LOT faster now (=faster menus?), however someone better check that first. It also means that page/title writes (create,update,move,blah) will be SLOWER, but in my opinion, optimizing reads over writes is preferable. As a little side effect this commit also potentially fixes #493  due to also fixing #770. And a further side effect, it will HIDE but NOT FIX #760. Potentially making that bug even more obscure (however it might still show up in the signals). As you can see, I've changed a lot of tests (because they looked broken in my opinion), so this patch should get extra care.",0
