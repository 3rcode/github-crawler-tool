Python implements thread-local data through the threading.local class, but as of Django 3.x, multiple requests can be handled in a single thread and so thread-locals will no longer be unique to a single request. Django therefore provides asgiref.Local as a drop-in replacement.

With non-caching template loaders this doesn't matter, but with Django's caching template loader, the same template, with modified nodelist, will be used next time the template is requested. The main issue with this is that blocks inherited from a parent template, and not overridden, appear as though they were copied literally into the child template. Often this doesn't matter, but if the block uses block.super and adds content, then because it's interpreted twice, the added content will appear twice.",0

Originally introduced in commit 61f56dd14751bab4c0232a62afb87555216a67f4 with no rationale. These are the edge cases where it makes a difference, as far as I can tell:  It forbids seeing published subpages when all roots are unpublished.   But why the special treatment of roots and not caring about other   intermediary levels? And it checks for any roots regardless of   placement, even if it's in a different hierarchy. It prevents seeing a draft version of a page if there are no draft   versions of any root pages in the site. If that's at all possible, it   seems like a bug?",0

Until now, the maintainer/content-editors of a site had to do and detect this manually. I propose we add a signal cms.signals.urls_need_reloading which fires when the CMS detects the server needs a restart. This signal is just sent by the django CMS. The core itself does nothing when this signal is sent. However it allows developers to write custom listeners to that signal that take an appropriate action in their envirnment. For some common use cases, there might even be generic implementations (outside djagno-cms core) which solve this issue (eg killing os.getppid in single-server gunicorn systems).",0

11344,Added some documentation to the custom plugins section.,0.58681405,"Moving plugins between placeholders, plugin api (#7394)","The ""view restrictions"" and ""page permissions"" inlines on the ""page"" admin change forms can cause performance problems where there are many thousands of users being put into simple select boxes. Added a new setting (CMS_RAW_ID_USERS) that, if set, forces the inlines on that page to use standard Django admin ""raw ID"" lookups rather than select boxes. The restriction on which users may be selected should still be honoured by the new widget because we set the 'limit_choices_to' attribute to be the same as the queryset on the original widget. Using raw_id_fields in combination with limit_choices_to blows up if you have many thousands of users. For this reason, we only apply this limit if the number of users is relatively small (< 500, though that figure is somewhat arbitrary). If the number of users we need to limit to is greater than that, we use the usual input field instead unless the user is a CMS superuser, in which case we bypass the limit. Unfortunately, this means that non-superusers won't see any benefit from this change.",0

12357,fixes #2650,0.5264436,Bugfixes wrt 4.1.0rc2,"I wanted to fix #885, which I did. However it appeared that Page.get_absolute_url was a complete mess. So I ended up fixing that, by moving page-path (url) logic to post-save (Title/Page) signals and compute them there, and store them in Title.path. This means Page.get_absolute_url() should be A LOT faster now (=faster menus?), however someone better check that first. It also means that page/title writes (create,update,move,blah) will be SLOWER, but in my opinion, optimizing reads over writes is preferable. As a little side effect this commit also potentially fixes #493  due to also fixing #770. And a further side effect, it will HIDE but NOT FIX #760. Potentially making that bug even more obscure (however it might still show up in the signals). As you can see, I've changed a lot of tests (because they looked broken in my opinion), so this patch should get extra care.",0
