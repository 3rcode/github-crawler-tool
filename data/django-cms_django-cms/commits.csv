Added a new setting (CMS_RAW_ID_USERS) that, if set, forces the inlines on that page to use standard Django admin ""raw ID"" lookups rather than select boxes. The restriction on which users may be selected should still be honoured by the new widget because we set the 'limit_choices_to' attribute to be the same as the queryset on the original widget. Using raw_id_fields in combination with limit_choices_to blows up if you have many thousands of users. For this reason, we only apply this limit if the number of users is relatively small (< 500, though that figure is somewhat arbitrary). If the number of users we need to limit to is greater than that, we use the usual input field instead unless the user is a CMS superuser, in which case we bypass the limit. Unfortunately, this means that non-superusers won't see any benefit from this change.",CMS_PERMISSION: optionally use raw id user lookups,"The ""view restrictions"" and ""page permissions"" inlines on the ""page"" admin change forms can cause performance problems where there are many thousands of users being put into simple select boxes.

12357,Okay this is a big one:,"I wanted to fix #885, which I did. However it appeared that Page.get_absolute_url was a complete mess. So I ended up fixing that, by moving page-path (url) logic to post-save (Title/Page) signals and compute them there, and store them in Title.path. This means Page.get_absolute_url() should be A LOT faster now (=faster menus?), however someone better check that first. It also means that page/title writes (create,update,move,blah) will be SLOWER, but in my opinion, optimizing reads over writes is preferable. As a little side effect this commit also potentially fixes #493  due to also fixing #770. And a further side effect, it will HIDE but NOT FIX #760. Potentially making that bug even more obscure (however it might still show up in the signals).
