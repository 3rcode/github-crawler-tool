1113,startup perf: Reduce require() calls,"Every require() that we do before the users sees UI reduces startup time. I used the following code (added to index.js) to log every require() call in the main process: js var Module = require('module') var required = {} Module.prototype.require = function (orig) {   return function (id) {     if (!required[id]) {       required[id] = true       console.log(`${id}   (from ${this.filename})`)     }     return orig.apply(this, arguments)   } }(Module.prototype.require) From this I was able to learn that lots of modules were being required that aren't actually used until later. I also sent this related PR to eliminate another few require()s: https://github.com/LinusU/node-application-config/pull/4 This increases startup time by 50ms.

1174,Add 64-bit Windows build,"Right now all Windows users are running a 32-bit app, even if their OS is 64-bit. Here's the plan to improve things:   We release a 64-bit installer, in addition to the 32-bit installer.   We auto-detect in the browser when a visitor is on a 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and try to offer them the right installer. When in doubt, we give them the 32-bit installer since that's safest.   The auto-updater will return the right binaries for the architecture the user is on. This means that all our existing users who have 64-bit OSs but are running the 32-bit app will get updated to the 64-bit app on the next update. Also, 64-bit users who accidentally download the 32-bit installer will also get the 64-bit app on the next update.    Other notes:  We don't generate 32-bit delta files. See reasoning inline. The package script now deletes extraneous Squirrel files (i.e. *.nupkg delta files for older versions of the app) which should make uploading the right files to GitHub easier. :)  The binary file naming works like this:   Most users are on 64-bit systems, so they get nice clean file names that don't specify an architecture (WebTorrentSetup-v1.0.0.exe). The 32-bit build files have the same naming but contain the string ""-ia32"" at the end. In a few years, we will be able to just stop producing the 32-bit build files entirely.   This means that the ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux-x64.zip"" linux build file is changing to ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux.zip"" to match the Windows naming convention. The .deb installer files must contain to architecture in order to install correctly, so those do not change.   Mac is 100% 64-bit, so it does not change.
