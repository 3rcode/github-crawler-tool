This causes the webtorrent process to get a  'wt-get-audio-metadata' before 'wt-start-torrenting'. You can reproduce it 100% of the time if you force the race condition to show itself by slowing down the sending of the 'wt-start-torrenting' event.

1042,package: Explicitly specify architectures to build for,"Electron now offers a ""armv7l"" build on Linux. Because we were specifying ""all"", we were generating an armv7l binary which was being included in ""WebTorrent-vX.X.X-linux.zip"" along with the ia32 build, which explains why it was 90MB+ in the last release."

1056,"perf: 90ms improvement: Defer more code in renderer, load state earlier","By deferring more code in the renderer and loading state earlier, we improve startup time by another 90ms! Before: 507 unique requires (1270-1280ms) After: 506 unique requires  (1180-1190ms)"
1057,perf: 60ms improvement: Replace fs-extra with mkdirp/rimraf/cp-file,"In Electron apps, the cost of large modules is very real. fs-extra is very convenient, but removing it caused 50 fewer unique files to be required(), resultin in 60ms faster startup! Before: 557 unique requires (1330-1340ms) After: 507 unique requires (1270-1280ms)"
1058,re-order scripts,

Sure, this removes a ""feature"", but it's a pretty surprising one. When I added it, I was being too clever, IMO. The trim code can be removed, because that's handled in controllers.torrentList.addTorrent()."
1065,Trim extra spaces off pasted magnet links,"Before this change, using the ""Open Torrent Address"" dialog to paste a magnet link would fail with leading or trailing spaces. Pasting on the torrent list page has always trimmed. So this PR just makes it consistent."
1066,style: fix inconsistent naming,"We don't use ""ID"" anywhere else in the codebase."

1073,Remove unnecessary files after removal of npm package.,
1074,Make Portable App also a Silent App,"Fixes two portable app bugs, to make the app fully ""silent"", not just ""portable"". This means that not only are all data files stored in the ""Portable Settings"" folder, but the app should leave no trace on the host system.   Disable Electron's single instance mode so no lock file is created in ""%APPDATA%\Roaming\WebTorrent"".   Put Electron crash files, and other electron files into the ""Portable Settings\Temp"" folder instead of ""%APPDATA%\Temp"". "
1075,Remove .nodemonignore file.,"Adding configuration files for every tool used will clutter up the repository, especially for a configuration as simple as this."
1076,"Fix ""Download path missing"" for Portable App first run","Create ""Portable Settings/Downloads"" folder to prevent ""Download path missing"" warning."

1082,Fix Windows Portable App mode,"Fixes: #971 This is a perfect example of putting too many statements into a try-catch block. My bad. I was trying to keep the code simple, but it bit us here. This happens because we were using IS_PRODUCTION, but the order of the consts at the top are: const IS_PORTABLE = isPortable() const IS_PRODUCTION = isProduction() So we're inside of isPortable() and referring to IS_PRODUCTION before it's defined. This should have thrown an exception, since const does not allow use-before-define, but we're transforming to ES5 with Babel. Also, standard could have caught this, but we can't enable the use-before-define rule until this bug is fixed: https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/636 Basically, a perfect storm."

Makes the window show slightly later, but it's gray for less time. Doesn't affect overall startup time. Feels less jank IMO. From the Electron docs:  While loading the page, the 'ready-to-show' event will be emitted when renderer process has done drawing for the first time, showing window after this event will have no visual flash."
1110,Merge pull request #957 from feross/f/perf,startup perf: Reduce require() calls
1111,startup perf: Reduce require() calls,"Every require() that we do before the users sees UI reduces startup time. I used the following code (added to index.js) to log every require() call in the main process: js var Module = require('module') var required = {} Module.prototype.require = function (orig) {   return function (id) {     if (!required[id]) {       required[id] = true       console.log(`${id}   (from ${this.filename})`)     }     return orig.apply(this, arguments)   } }(Module.prototype.require) From this I was able to learn that lots of modules were being required that aren't actually used until later. I also sent this related PR to eliminate another few require()s: https://github.com/LinusU/node-application-config/pull/4 This increases startup time by 50ms. We'll probably realize much bigger gains by following this same procedure for the renderer process."

1172,Add 64-bit Windows build,"Right now all Windows users are running a 32-bit app, even if their OS is 64-bit. Here's the plan to improve things:   We release a 64-bit installer, in addition to the 32-bit installer.   We auto-detect in the browser when a visitor is on a 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and try to offer them the right installer. When in doubt, we give them the 32-bit installer since that's safest.   The auto-updater will return the right binaries for the architecture the user is on. This means that all our existing users who have 64-bit OSs but are running the 32-bit app will get updated to the 64-bit app on the next update. Also, 64-bit users who accidentally download the 32-bit installer will also get the 64-bit app on the next update.    Other notes:  We don't generate 32-bit delta files. See reasoning inline. The package script now deletes extraneous Squirrel files (i.e. *.nupkg delta files for older versions of the app) which should make uploading the right files to GitHub easier. :)  The binary file naming works like this:   Most users are on 64-bit systems, so they get nice clean file names that don't specify an architecture (WebTorrentSetup-v1.0.0.exe). The 32-bit build files have the same naming but contain the string ""-ia32"" at the end. In a few years, we will be able to just stop producing the 32-bit build files entirely.   This means that the ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux-x64.zip"" linux build file is changing to ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux.zip"" to match the Windows naming convention. The .deb installer files must contain to architecture in order to install correctly, so those do not change.   Mac is 100% 64-bit, so it does not change. "

1400,electron-prebuilt@1.3.0,Another Electron was just released. Let's bump from 1.2.8 to 1.3.0. Changelog:  Upgrade to Chrome 52 Update to Node.js 6.3.0
1401,Linux: Support showing badge count,"This was a macOS-only API before, but it's cross-platform now via app.setBadgeCount()"
1402,Electron: Use 'quit' role,
1403,macOS: add missing Edit menu roles,
1404,Electron: Use default labels and accelerators,"Less code for us to maintain. This also gives us free internationalization in a future Electron version (they'll set the label dynamically based on the 'role') One slight regression with this change, but it will be fixed in a future Electron once this PR is merged: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/6600"

1632,Improve subtitle positioning (#551),"Before this commit, we tweaked the subtitle position by modifying the VTT file, line by line with a regex because I did not know it was possible to use CSS for it. But apparently there are Shadow DOM elements that we can use instead. This new approach improves:   Wrapping long lines. Before, the text would go off the edge of the screen. Now it wraps intelligently.   The subtitles move up to get out of the way of the controls when those are visible. "
1633,Associate .torrent files to WebTorrent Desktop (OS X) (#553),"Before this change, .torrent files would only be associated to WebTorrent Desktop if another torrent client (like Transmission) was installed on the system. That's because one of the user's apps needs to define ""UTExportedTypeDeclarations"". On a fresh machine, without Transmission, WebTorrent Desktop now associates .torrent files correctly. So it will appear in the ""Open With..."" menu and the webtorrent .torrent icon will be used for .torrent files. Closes #542."

This change unifies the two methods, and supports dragging .torrent files or creating a torrent when the player is active, if the dragged files are not .srt or .vtt.

2427,Batch virtual-dom changes (fix #27),"From main-loop:  main-loop is an optimization module for a virtual DOM system. Normally you would re-create the virtual tree every time your state changes. This is not optimum, with main-loop you will only update your virtual tree at most once per request animation frame. main-loop basically gives you batching of your virtual DOM changes, which means if you change your model multiple times it will be rendered once asynchronously on the next request animation frame."
