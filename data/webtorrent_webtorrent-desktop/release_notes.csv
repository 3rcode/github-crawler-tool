38,"The first official release of WebTorrent.app, the streaming torrent client for OS X, Windows, and Linux. For now, we're only releasing binaries for OS X.
WebTorrent.app is in ALPHA and under very active development – expect lots more polish in the coming weeks! If you know JavaScript and want to help us out, there's lots to do!
Features

Lightweight, fast torrent client
Beautiful user experience
Instantly stream video and audio from torrents!
WebTorrent fetches file pieces from the network on-demand, for instant playback.
Even when the file is not fully downloaded, seeking still works! (Seeking just reprioritizes what pieces are fetched from the network.)
Stream videos to AirPlay and Chromecast
Pure Javascript, so it's very easy to contribute code!
Based on the most popular and comprehensive torrent package in Node.js, webtorrent.
Lots of features, without the bloat:
Opens magnet links and .torrent files
Drag-and-drop makes adding torrents easy!
Seed files/folders by dragging them onto the app
Discovers peers via tracker servers, DHT (Distributed Hash Table), and peer exchange
Make the video window ""float on top"" for watching video while you work!
Supports WebTorrent protocol – for connecting to WebRTC peers (i.e. web browsers)
