1172,Document and cleanup announcement/dialog/handlers.js,0.5432455,"Clean up the code. Split main.js, refactor lots of things","Right now all Windows users are running a 32-bit app, even if their OS is 64-bit. Here's the plan to improve things:   We release a 64-bit installer, in addition to the 32-bit installer.   We auto-detect in the browser when a visitor is on a 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and try to offer them the right installer. When in doubt, we give them the 32-bit installer since that's safest.   The auto-updater will return the right binaries for the architecture the user is on. This means that all our existing users who have 64-bit OSs but are running the 32-bit app will get updated to the 64-bit app on the next update. Also, 64-bit users who accidentally download the 32-bit installer will also get the 64-bit app on the next update.    Other notes:  We don't generate 32-bit delta files. See reasoning inline. The package script now deletes extraneous Squirrel files (i.e. *.nupkg delta files for older versions of the app) which should make uploading the right files to GitHub easier. :)  The binary file naming works like this:   Most users are on 64-bit systems, so they get nice clean file names that don't specify an architecture (WebTorrentSetup-v1.0.0.exe). The 32-bit build files have the same naming but contain the string ""-ia32"" at the end. In a few years, we will be able to just stop producing the 32-bit build files entirely.   This means that the ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux-x64.zip"" linux build file is changing to ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux.zip"" to match the Windows naming convention. The .deb installer files must contain to architecture in order to install correctly, so those do not change.   Mac is 100% 64-bit, so it does not change. ",0

Fixes #219   Signing is now optional (so OS X and Windows contributors can run npm run package without errors)   zip, dmg, and deb arguments are now passed in as e.g. ""--package=dmg""   Print a huge warning when signing is disabled so we're less likely to ship unsigned binaries to users.   Make console.logs during packaging consistent and parallel (""creating..."" followed by ""created."")   More aggressive signing warnings   Warn when building OS X app on non-OS X platform (because signing will never work on non-OS X platforms)  Warn when building Windows app on non-Windows platform (because signing doesn't work yet on non-Windows platforms)",0
