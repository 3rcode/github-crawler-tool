Add 64-bit Windows build,0.66745913,Windows 32-bit build.,"Right now all Windows users are running a 32-bit app, even if their OS is 64-bit. Here's the plan to improve things:   We release a 64-bit installer, in addition to the 32-bit installer.   We auto-detect in the browser when a visitor is on a 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and try to offer them the right installer. When in doubt, we give them the 32-bit installer since that's safest.   The auto-updater will return the right binaries for the architecture the user is on. This means that all our existing users who have 64-bit OSs but are running the 32-bit app will get updated to the 64-bit app on the next update. Also, 64-bit users who accidentally download the 32-bit installer will also get the 64-bit app on the next update.    Other notes:  We don't generate 32-bit delta files. See reasoning inline. The package script now deletes extraneous Squirrel files (i.e. *.nupkg delta files for older versions of the app) which should make uploading the right files to GitHub easier. :)  The binary file naming works like this:   Most users are on 64-bit systems, so they get nice clean file names that don't specify an architecture (WebTorrentSetup-v1.0.0.exe). The 32-bit build files have the same naming but contain the string ""-ia32"" at the end. In a few years, we will be able to just stop producing the 32-bit build files entirely.   This means that the ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux-x64.zip"" linux build file is changing to ""WebTorrent-v0.15.0-linux.zip"" to match the Windows naming convention. The .deb installer files must contain to architecture in order to install correctly, so those do not change.   Mac is 100% 64-bit, so it does not change. ",0

If you know JavaScript and want to help us out, there's lots to do!","  Separate hidden window, with its own renderer process, for WebTorrent   (Must be a window. You cannot run WebRTC at all in a Web Worker, and you can't    run it well in a node process like the electron main process.)   Disabled the create-torrent-modal for now. That gives us a consistent UX   regardless of whether the user dragged files or folders onto the app or opened   the Create New Torrent menu item.   Main process routes all messages between the main and webtorrent windows.   The renderer index.js is smaller now (but still too big), with the WebTorrent   interface moved to webtorrent.js / it's own process.   The UI should be faster now, and should not lag under load. ",1

Batch virtual-dom changes (fix #27),0.5215832,Reduce the number of DOM updates substantially,"From main-loop:  main-loop is an optimization module for a virtual DOM system. Normally you would re-create the virtual tree every time your state changes. This is not optimum, with main-loop you will only update your virtual tree at most once per request animation frame. main-loop basically gives you batching of your virtual DOM changes, which means if you change your model multiple times it will be rendered once asynchronously on the next request animation frame.",0
