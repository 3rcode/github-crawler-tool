4737,Refactor Knex.js query building (#1472)," Refactor Knex.js query building  We had some bugs in generated SQL having ambiguous column references for GraphQL queries containing ""many"" relationships.  We also had a problem with ""many"" relationship queries triggering intermediate SQL queries that were blowing out in size (specifically the auto-generated IN clause). It wasn't easy to fix both without reworking the SQL generator to make subqueries easier to build, and aliases easier to track. The implementation of ""many"" relationships still has room for improvement, but it's working well enough for our site now. While I was at it, I pushed the work of populateMany() into the main query by using array_agg subqueries.  This reduces the number of database calls a lot.   Fix unused stuff warnings from linter   Fix test and prettier failures   Add test for many filtering mixed with other relationship filtering   Add changeset for knex query builder refactoring   Linter fixes   Revert populateMany replacement   Review fixes "

4790,Adding module field config and support in most field types (#1405),"  Adding ""universal"" module field config and updating all relevant field types to support it.   The Mongoose field adapters pass all config though to Mongoose (via module) but the effect will often not be intuitive. It allows, for example, creating unique constraints on a checkboxes field. Also, for any field that store subdocuments, the module and module config will be ignored.  The Knex field adapters are a bit more sensible. Fields that don't support the module or module config will error if it's provided.  Also done some pretty significant refactoring of how the knex adapters (db, list and fields) constructors handle config. It's now a lot easier for fields to support or not support whatever they want.   Changeset   Apply suggestions from code review   Co-authored-by: Jess Telford link"

4811,Updating the Mongoose list adapter so it doesn't add an id field itself but instead refer to the MongoId type. Removing exceptional/hardcoded module related query conditions from the tokenizer and related tests. Adding default primary key config to the MongoID type and hacking it up to implicitly support the module path when operating as a primary key and to cast back and forth between native ObjectIds.,

4813,Updating lists to allow 'id' fields to be specified or fallback to a default provided by the listAdapter that's added into the fields array like any other field; removing exceptional module fields from list GraphQL types. Updating test to reflect that module is now a field in the field array.,
4814,Updating auto increment field type to support both module and module graphQL types,
4815,"Codifying that lists always have a single primary key and it's always at path 'id'. Refactoring the auto increment field type to use this universal flag rather than it's own knexOptions config by the same name. Also passes module field property through to the admin UI so primary keys can be excluded (as, previously, they effectively were). This more or less lets us dodge issues #1397 and #1398.",

5298,Expose result of running relationship operations (create/connect/disconnect) (#1033)," Expose result of running relationship operations (create/connect/disconnect)  Enables future code to inspect the result of specific operations rather than relying solely on a flattened array of IDs. In particular; the Content Editor serializes data from slate.js into a set of operations which it then needs to inject back into the slate.js document. It does this by tracking module/module operation indicies but without this change was not able to map those indicies back to the final ID. The added complication here was the possibility of module results due to Access Control or Where clauses which filtered out items. Now, those module results are preserved in the operation outputs, and filtered by a second stage function for when obtaining just the flattened ID array is the desired goal.

5308,Ensure Content Block views are always loaded (#1018),"Previous behaviour was to rely on manually importing a block for it to be included (eg; module imports the module block). While this is currently always the case, it doesn't necessarily have to be. One example might be a 3rd party block which wants to create heading+subheading pair, and set a dependency on the module block without ever importing it (instead; referencing it by its type name from within the 3rd party block). By surfacing the type on the server / during webpack build we're able to do a couple more checks such as for duplicates and also replace the sparse config array with a keyed object. Finally, we can pull up the default module block into the pre-build step and remove that logic from the client code, making it a bit cleaner."
