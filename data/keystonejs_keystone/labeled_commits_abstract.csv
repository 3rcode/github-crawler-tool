Add account config params in destroy method (#3220),0.44766155,#6239 module Thanks @timleslie! - Added more details to before/after change/delete hook error messages.,"Add account config params in destroy method We are not setting global configuration (api_key, api_secret, and cloud_name) in our cloudinary SDK. We are relying on passing these mandatory config settings in the options param of the upload API. But in the case of destroy method, we are omitting them and passing on default empty options object as an argument. This results in a rejected promise. To fix this issue, we are now injecting these values in the provided options object. User can still override these values if required.

This patch drops that down to a few ms. We have some complex-to-build-but-quick-on-the-DB API calls that are about twice as fast with this patch.  It also improves performance when multiple requests are in flight because tasks aren't blocking one other trying to build queries so much. commit 6882330bf89042de9903e267b3b4f360156eb7bf Merge: 81406960 0cf142b1 Author: sarneaud sarneaud@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Wed Aug 14 14:05:50 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1494 from keystonejs/knexopt Some minor performance improvements to Knex adapter commit 0cf142b17bc3c62d79b09751920ea5796b142592 Merge: b8d30f57 81406960 Author: sarneaud sarneaud@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Wed Aug 14 13:59:13 2019 +1000 Merge branch 'master' into knexopt commit b8d30f5793f32198dd90234731f3faf45e1064f9 Author: Simon Arneaud simon@thinkmill.com.au Date:   Wed Aug 14 03:51:04 2019 +0000 Some minor performance improvements to Knex adapter commit 81406960c373849bb616ec32ba20a035298f8dcc Merge: fe262797 02ac9fa4 Author: Mike mike@madebymike.com.au Date:   Wed Aug 14 13:27:52 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1491 from keystonejs/list-plugins List plugins commit 02ac9fa410a91c9d5219cf7868695c5bb15e4e18 Author: Mike mike@Mikes-MBP.lan Date:   Wed Aug 14 11:50:20 2019 +1000 Update create-list API commit 36616092c98e07be41dd1db89ce2ea4e2c8afb60 Author: Tim Leslie timl@thinkmill.com.au Date:   Tue Aug 13 16:02:07 2019 +1000 Add plugins options to createList config commit fe262797b05cf50fb858e59d8b64c1f7498f4fa5 Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 12:05:26 2019 +1000 Prepare release (#1490) commit 3eeb07c79173ade1c5081d8e43677586b78fc567 Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 11:50:43 2019 +1000 Re-instate default config for Knex adapter (#1488)   Re-instate default config for Knex adapter   Throw the correct connection error from KnexAdapter   commit fcad8fc1f412bd900836baf3679ad17109065cbc Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 10:47:07 2019 +1000 Prepare release (#1485) commit e049cfcbb29810c82dc9ac59f6f60b763d3aba7b Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 10:23:09 2019 +1000 Default function (#1480)   Knex adapter is smarter about default values   Support defaultValue as a function in view Controllers   Support defaultValue as a function   Better waiting code for tests   Add changeset   Clarify what the module can be in docs.

We also had a problem with ""many"" relationship queries triggering intermediate SQL queries that were blowing out in size (specifically the auto-generated IN clause). It wasn't easy to fix both without reworking the SQL generator to make subqueries easier to build, and aliases easier to track. The implementation of ""many"" relationships still has room for improvement, but it's working well enough for our site now. While I was at it, I pushed the work of populateMany() into the main query by using array_agg subqueries.  This reduces the number of database calls a lot.   Fix unused stuff warnings from linter   Fix test and prettier failures   Add test for many filtering mixed with other relationship filtering   Add changeset for knex query builder refactoring   Linter fixes   Revert populateMany replacement   Review fixes   commit 9e582544c270bc3e6b6e37898e32096e7a2d278b Merge: 18be01b2 c0d1038c Author: Mike mike@madebymike.com.au Date:   Tue Aug 13 09:35:01 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1482 from keystonejs/thiagodebastos-patch-1 Fix typos in CalendarDay/README.md commit c0d1038c065f888f0e5a04b2402516c96d382248 Merge: 84f673e7 18be01b2 Author: Mike mike@madebymike.com.au Date:   Tue Aug 13 09:27:31 2019 +1000 Merge branch 'master' into thiagodebastos-patch-1 commit 18be01b29ec5b8756b19ae244505078df353298e Merge: 33fdc89f 3e9a1604 Author: Mike mike@madebymike.com.au Date:   Tue Aug 13 06:02:02 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1483 from keystonejs/thiagodebastos-patch-2 Fix potential typo in CalendarDay/README.md commit 3e9a16045d1318a17989f444475946dfd4ce3916 Author: Thiago De Bastos thiagodebastos@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Mon Aug 12 22:41:51 2019 +1000 Fix potential typo in CalendarDay/README.md  GraphQL module fields use the module type in GraphQL.

Speed up Knex query condition lookup (#1496),0.5313579,Query Generation Performance,"For some some of our more complex GraphQL queries, the Knex adapter was spending ~100ms generating Knex queries in total.  This patch drops that down to a few ms. We have some complex-to-build-but-quick-on-the-DB API calls that are about twice as fast with this patch.  It also improves performance when multiple requests are in flight because tasks aren't blocking one other trying to build queries so much.",0

Refactor Knex.js query building (#1472),0.4929456,query {,"Refactor Knex.js query building We had some bugs in generated SQL having ambiguous column references for GraphQL queries containing ""many"" relationships.  We also had a problem with ""many"" relationship queries triggering intermediate SQL queries that were blowing out in size (specifically the auto-generated IN clause). It wasn't easy to fix both without reworking the SQL generator to make subqueries easier to build, and aliases easier to track. The implementation of ""many"" relationships still has room for improvement, but it's working well enough for our site now. While I was at it, I pushed the work of populateMany() into the main query by using array_agg subqueries.  This reduces the number of database calls a lot. Fix unused stuff warnings from linter Fix test and prettier failures Add test for many filtering mixed with other relationship filtering Add changeset for knex query builder refactoring Linter fixes Revert populateMany replacement Review fixes",0

Adding isIndexed field config and support in most field types (#1405),0.7609278,"Aside from dependency updates 😴, we added an isIndexed config option to the text, integer, float, select, and timestamp field types.","Adding ""universal"" isIndexed field config and updating all relevant field types to support it. The Mongoose field adapters pass all config though to Mongoose (via mergeSchemaOptions()) but the effect will often not be intuitive. It allows, for example, creating unique constraints on a checkboxes field. Also, for any field that store subdocuments, the index and unique config will be ignored. The Knex field adapters are a bit more sensible. Fields that don't support the isIndexed or isUnique config will error if it's provided. Also done some pretty significant refactoring of how the knex adapters (db, list and fields) constructors handle config. It's now a lot easier for fields to support or not support whatever they want.

Expose result of running relationship operations (create/connect/disconnect) (#1033),0.49560758,A module relationship field would have the following field added to the API:,"Expose result of running relationship operations (create/connect/disconnect) Enables future code to inspect the result of specific operations rather than relying solely on a flattened array of IDs. In particular; the Content Editor serializes data from slate.js into a set of operations which it then needs to inject back into the slate.js document. It does this by tracking create/connect operation indicies but without this change was not able to map those indicies back to the final ID. The added complication here was the possibility of null results due to Access Control or Where clauses which filtered out items. Now, those null results are preserved in the operation outputs, and filtered by a second stage function for when obtaining just the flattened ID array is the desired goal. Add edge case tests for mongo specific relationships Add changeset",0

Ensure Content Block views are always loaded (#1018),0.34657797,This is in addition to the current support for live reloading changes to custom views in the Admin UI.,"Previous behaviour was to rely on manually importing a block for it to be included (eg; unordered-list imports the list-item block). While this is currently always the case, it doesn't necessarily have to be. One example might be a 3rd party block which wants to create heading+subheading pair, and set a dependency on the heading block without ever importing it (instead; referencing it by its type name from within the 3rd party block). By surfacing the type on the server / during webpack build we're able to do a couple more checks such as for duplicates and also replace the sparse config array with a keyed object. Finally, we can pull up the default paragraph block into the pre-build step and remove that logic from the client code, making it a bit cleaner.",0
