This means that rather than recieving originalInput as an array with itemIds, your access control functions will always be called with just an itemId and/or originalInput(depending on which access control function it is). If your access control functions already worked with creating/updating/deleting one item, they will continue working (though you may get TypeScript errors if you were previously handling itemIds and originalInput as an array, to fix that, you should stop handling that case).",  Better init   Update initial-data.js   Update packages/create-keystone-app/example-projects/starter/initial-data.js   Co-Authored-By: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st,0

This patch drops that down to a few ms.  We have some complex-to-build-but-quick-on-the-DB API calls that are about twice as fast with this patch.  It also improves performance when multiple requests are in flight because tasks aren't blocking one other trying to build queries so much.  commit 6882330bf89042de9903e267b3b4f360156eb7bf Merge: 81406960 0cf142b1 Author: sarneaud sarneaud@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Wed Aug 14 14:05:50 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1494 from keystonejs/knexopt  Some minor performance improvements to Knex adapter  commit 0cf142b17bc3c62d79b09751920ea5796b142592 Merge: b8d30f57 81406960 Author: sarneaud sarneaud@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Wed Aug 14 13:59:13 2019 +1000 Merge branch 'master' into knexopt  commit b8d30f5793f32198dd90234731f3faf45e1064f9 Author: Simon Arneaud simon@thinkmill.com.au Date:   Wed Aug 14 03:51:04 2019 +0000 Some minor performance improvements to Knex adapter  commit 81406960c373849bb616ec32ba20a035298f8dcc Merge: fe262797 02ac9fa4 Author: Mike mike@madebymike.com.au Date:   Wed Aug 14 13:27:52 2019 +1000 Merge pull request #1491 from keystonejs/list-plugins  List plugins  commit 02ac9fa410a91c9d5219cf7868695c5bb15e4e18 Author: Mike mike@Mikes-MBP.lan Date:   Wed Aug 14 11:50:20 2019 +1000 Update create-list API  commit 36616092c98e07be41dd1db89ce2ea4e2c8afb60 Author: Tim Leslie timl@thinkmill.com.au Date:   Tue Aug 13 16:02:07 2019 +1000 Add plugins options to createList config  commit fe262797b05cf50fb858e59d8b64c1f7498f4fa5 Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 12:05:26 2019 +1000 Prepare release (#1490)  commit 3eeb07c79173ade1c5081d8e43677586b78fc567 Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 11:50:43 2019 +1000 Re-instate default config for Knex adapter (#1488)  * Re-instate default config for Knex adapter  * Throw the correct connection error from KnexAdapter  commit fcad8fc1f412bd900836baf3679ad17109065cbc Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 10:47:07 2019 +1000 Prepare release (#1485)  commit e049cfcbb29810c82dc9ac59f6f60b763d3aba7b Author: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st Date:   Tue Aug 13 10:23:09 2019 +1000 Default function (#1480)  * Knex adapter is smarter about default values  * Support defaultValue as a function in view Controllers  * Support defaultValue as a function  * Better waiting code for tests  * Add changeset  * Clarify what the `defaultValue` can be in docs.

It allows, for example, creating unique constraints on a checkboxes field. Also, for any field that store subdocuments, the index and unique config will be ignored.  The Knex field adapters are a bit more sensible. Fields that don't support the isIndexed or isUnique config will error if it's provided.  Also done some pretty significant refactoring of how the knex adapters (db, list and fields) constructors handle config. It's now a lot easier for fields to support or not support whatever they want.   Changeset   Apply suggestions from code review   Co-authored-by: Jess Telford jess+github@jes.st",0

This means that rather than recieving originalInput as an array with itemIds, your access control functions will always be called with just an itemId and/or originalInput(depending on which access control function it is). If your access control functions already worked with creating/updating/deleting one item, they will continue working (though you may get TypeScript errors if you were previously handling itemIds and originalInput as an array, to fix that, you should stop handling that case).",,0

In particular; the Content Editor serializes data from slate.js into a set of operations which it then needs to inject back into the slate.js document. It does this by tracking create/connect operation indicies but without this change was not able to map those indicies back to the final ID. The added complication here was the possibility of null results due to Access Control or Where clauses which filtered out items. Now, those null results are preserved in the operation outputs, and filtered by a second stage function for when obtaining just the flattened ID array is the desired goal.

(#7722) @borisno2,"Previous behaviour was to rely on manually importing a block for it to be included (eg; unordered-list imports the list-item block). While this is currently always the case, it doesn't necessarily have to be. One example might be a 3rd party block which wants to create heading+subheading pair, and set a dependency on the heading block without ever importing it (instead; referencing it by its type name from within the 3rd party block). By surfacing the type on the server / during webpack build we're able to do a couple more checks such as for duplicates and also replace the sparse config array with a keyed object. Finally, we can pull up the default paragraph block into the pre-build step and remove that logic from the client code, making it a bit cleaner.",1

This means that rather than recieving originalInput as an array with itemIds, your access control functions will always be called with just an itemId and/or originalInput(depending on which access control function it is). If your access control functions already worked with creating/updating/deleting one item, they will continue working (though you may get TypeScript errors if you were previously handling itemIds and originalInput as an array, to fix that, you should stop handling that case).",,0
