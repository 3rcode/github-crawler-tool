This means that rather than recieving originalInput as an array with itemIds, your access control functions will always be called with just an itemId and/or originalInput(depending on which access control function it is). If your access control functions already worked with creating/updating/deleting one item, they will continue working (though you may get TypeScript errors if you were previously handling itemIds and originalInput as an array, to fix that, you should stop handling that case).",Co-authored-by: Renovate Bot bot@renovateapp.com,0

This means that rather than recieving originalInput as an array with itemIds, your access control functions will always be called with just an itemId and/or originalInput(depending on which access control function it is). If your access control functions already worked with creating/updating/deleting one item, they will continue working (though you may get TypeScript errors if you were previously handling itemIds and originalInput as an array, to fix that, you should stop handling that case).",,0

We also had a problem with ""many"" relationship queries triggering intermediate SQL queries that were blowing out in size (specifically the auto-generated IN clause).  It wasn't easy to fix both without reworking the SQL generator to make subqueries easier to build, and aliases easier to track.  The implementation of ""many"" relationships still has room for improvement, but it's working well enough for our site now.  While I was at it, I pushed the work of populateMany() into the main query by using array_agg subqueries.  This reduces the number of database calls a lot.  * Fix unused stuff warnings from linter  * Fix test and prettier failures  * Add test for many filtering mixed with other relationship filtering  * Add changeset for knex query builder refactoring  * Linter fixes  * Revert populateMany replacement  * Review fixes  commit 9e582544c270bc3e6b6e37898e32096e7a2d278b Merge: 18be01b2 c0d1038c Author:

4722,Fix prettier errors,0.5627686,Improved Error Messaging 📟," Refactor Knex.js query building  We had some bugs in generated SQL having ambiguous column references for GraphQL queries containing ""many"" relationships.  We also had a problem with ""many"" relationship queries triggering intermediate SQL queries that were blowing out in size (specifically the auto-generated IN clause). It wasn't easy to fix both without reworking the SQL generator to make subqueries easier to build, and aliases easier to track. The implementation of ""many"" relationships still has room for improvement, but it's working well enough for our site now. While I was at it, I pushed the work of populateMany() into the main query by using array_agg subqueries.  This reduces the number of database calls a lot.   Fix unused stuff warnings from linter   Fix test and prettier failures   Add test for many filtering mixed with other relationship filtering   Add changeset for knex query builder refactoring   Linter fixes   Revert populateMany replacement   Review fixes ",0

The Mongoose field adapters pass all config though to Mongoose (via mergeSchemaOptions()) but the effect will often not be intuitive. It allows, for example, creating unique constraints on a checkboxes field. Also, for any field that store subdocuments, the index and unique config will be ignored.  The Knex field adapters are a bit more sensible. Fields that don't support the isIndexed or isUnique config will error if it's provided.  Also done some pretty significant refactoring of how the knex adapters (db, list and fields) constructors handle config.

In particular; the Content Editor serializes data from slate.js into a set of operations which it then needs to inject back into the slate.js document. It does this by tracking create/connect operation indicies but without this change was not able to map those indicies back to the final ID. The added complication here was the possibility of null results due to Access Control or Where clauses which filtered out items. Now, those null results are preserved in the operation outputs, and filtered by a second stage function for when obtaining just the flattened ID array is the desired goal.

5293,Update tests to reflect desired functionality,0.64153266,@keystone-next/testing,"Previous behaviour was to rely on manually importing a block for it to be included (eg; unordered-list imports the list-item block). While this is currently always the case, it doesn't necessarily have to be. One example might be a 3rd party block which wants to create heading+subheading pair, and set a dependency on the heading block without ever importing it (instead; referencing it by its type name from within the 3rd party block). By surfacing the type on the server / during webpack build we're able to do a couple more checks such as for duplicates and also replace the sparse config array with a keyed object. Finally, we can pull up the default paragraph block into the pre-build step and remove that logic from the client code, making it a bit cleaner.",0
