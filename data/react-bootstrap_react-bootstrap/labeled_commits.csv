fix(FormCheck): fix Form.Check.Label spacing (#5983),0.83437055,"FormCheck: fix Form.Check.Label spacing (#5983) (250655c), closes /github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/issues/5938#issuecomment-883704209"," Fix Form.Check.Label spacing  Currently, when using a Form.Check.Label component to customize Form.Check rendering, there will be no space between the checkbox and the label. This is because Form.Check is currently relying on the presence of a label prop to apply the form-check class name to the wrapping <div>, because checkboxes without labels don't need the wrapping element to have the form-check class name. This commit adds a utility to check whether an element has a child of a certain type. It then uses that utility to check if a Form.Check element has a Form.Check.Label child and takes that into account when determining whether the checkbox has a label. Adding a special property (currently called typeName, but that can certainly change) to components for this utility is necessary because React minifies the displayName property in production.   Add error handling to includesType   Support mixing auto and custom child components   Currently, Form.Check doesn't allow users to use a custom Form.Check.Input with a label generated by the label prop (and requires that a custom Form.Check.Input be used if a custom Form.Check.Label is also used) because the presence of any children in Form.Check prevents automatic inputs and labels (and feedback) from generating. This approach allows mixing and matching by extracting any custom input, label, and feedback components from Form.Check's children prop, then separately for each, using the custom component if provided or an automatic component otherwise.  Simply check child.type  The type property of React elements have reference equality with matching imported component variables (JSXElementConstructor objects, to be precise)! For some reason I was not expecting that, but it makes sense to me now, since these constructor objects are being imported from a singular source, so there's no reason React would create multiple instances of them. So child.type === type all we need to check in getChildOfType; the typeName prop I added earlier is not at all needed.  Add scripts for testing production build of docs  Just as a convenience. I can revert this commit if these scripts aren't desired.   Just check immediate children for FormCheckLabel   Use correct variable   Revert empty .husky/pre-commit change   No idea how that got into 0754b49.  Revert ""Add scripts for testing production build of docs""  This reverts commit 5343b0a8de88550fb4c5ecba0bded75e17f55505.",1

feat: add default variant to Alert/Badge (#5456),0.91203,add default variant to Alert/Badge (#5456) (8f76539),"This sets a default variant and bg of ""primary"" for Alert and Badge respectively, allowing them to be used without having to set a variant or bg. Bootstrap's docs on Alerts require the use of a contextual class (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/alerts/) in order to have proper styling. This aligns Alert and Badge variant functionality with that of Button and Navbar. This could be viewed as a breaking change (e.g. for someone using Alert without a variant [as it now adds one] or someone relying on Button's .btn-null [if the variant was null]).  However, I'm inclined to view this as a feature as it is adding & declaring functionality in the public API where behaviour wasn't previously explicitly defined in examples or docs.",1

This was already possible in Form.Control via its ""as"" prop but not in Form.Check. Example use case: the Formik library provides form components which pull form context information and automatically control form element state and event handlers.

This will allow the users to choose how they want the popovers to be displayed, whether they want a title, no title, or if they want to inject their own custom title. also start work on changing the popover docs to reflect this new behavior. also start work on updating the popover unit tests to reflect this new behavior   update graphql queries to properly grab the Popover components   fix: compilation issues due to not binding the Popover components   this issue was caused by the HOC function not carrying over the properties of the function, which were the modulated popover components.  add shorthand syntax for Popover, and fix bsPrefix issue  add a shorthand syntax for declaring a popover with no title. also fix bsPrefix issues with PopoverTitle and PopoverContent  fix: very simple mistake of passing the string 'children' and not the actual children prop  i don't know how i missed this :eyes:   update all of the Popover example docs to reflect new api   fix: applying header styling to PopoverTitle   this should be applied based on the user's preference, via className  Add 'as' prop to PopoverContent and PopoverTitle  this will allow users to define a custom element type for their Popover components (such as setting PopoverTitle to use an 'h3' element)  Apply suggestions from code review  Update Popover examples to utilize new as prop on PopoverTitle Co-Authored-By: Jimmy Jia tesrin@gmail.com BREAKING CHANGE: Popovers now expose sub components Content, Title for building up popovers",0

"fix(Modal): set display block always, fixes #3399 (#3571)",0.655339,"Modal: Fix wrong types on ModalProps (#6022) (18ef232), closes #5894","We started setting display: block to div.modal at onEnter timing of Transition at Pull #3187. But when we set animation={false} to Modal, the Transition object is not created and therefore onEnter (=handleEnter) is not called. This causes empty modal when animation set false (I think this is the issue #3399 ). This PR tries to fix this behavior by setting the modal's display style to block always. I think this doesn't break existing behavior because as @jquense says  we don't allow modals to be in the DOM prior to showing   the modal's dom element doesn't exist before rendering. So I think it's safe to set display always block.",0

feat: add support for Spinners (#3541),0.47067422,Spinner: make the animation default to border (#6468) (fb3e4d5),"Adds support for the spinners components introduced in Bootstrap 4.2. Changes: - Adds new Spinner component - Add tests for new component - Creates new page in documentation for new component - Upgrades documentation CSS to Bootstrap 4.2 (given the claimed 4.2 support in the documentation itself)  Notes: - I wasn't sure about the terminology for the property that switches between the two styles of spinner component. I couldn't think of a good term that wouldn't overlap with an existing property. animation was chosen at it was the most representative of the changes the property made, but I feel it may still be too ambiguous. I'm open to alternative suggestions. - Whilst the documentation claims compatibility with Bootstrap 4.2 it was using a Bootstrap 4.1 CSS file. I've upgraded the documentation to a Bootstrap 4.2 version of the CSS file. I can remove this change and submit seperately if necessary.",0

feat: first pass of typescript types for everything (#3411),0.487348,Better propType checking #163 #167,"Welp, that took longer than I was expecting! I think I've got a reasonable set of prop types for each module, but i got a bit tired of detailed checking towards the end. I'm not sure whether the polymorphic as behaviour actually works correctly - although in theory the types I've got there should handle it. Because of the generated types for the final component props, the error messages can be a bit wordy - but they do seem to also include the important information as well. I've added dtslint into the build, but unfortunately this only checks the types against the simple.test.tsx file, it doesn't check the types against the actual implementation in any way. Another mild annoyance is that although i've matched up the component filenames, the types don't work for the individual component files because of the lib vs src vs es part of the build process. In theory the files could be duplicated during the build for the exported code if this is desired.",0

Documentation per request in #1721,0.42491317,See the project board for a list of changes and current work in progress., The require statement in ReactPlayground.js for bootstrapUtils needed .default; that area of JavaScript is still unfamiliar to me- advice on a better approach is welcome. I am not providing an import hint for bootstrapUtils per #1728 comment by @taion. I suspect this will be difficult for new users to figure out since the location of bootstrapUtils looks to require a path (e.g. import bootstrapUtils from 'react-bootstrap/lib/utils/bootstrapUtils';).

(Useful should you want to use glyphicons or   custom html within the toggle that's not a simple string.) - SplitToggle Similar to the DropdownToggle but targeted at the   SplitButton's toggle. - Generic Dropdown component for easy dropdown customization. Changed: - Event handling of all these components to be in line with #419 - Written with ES6 class syntax Removed: - DropdownStateMixin - Everything is using ES6 class syntax so no more   mixin usage,1

Unfortunately since Bootstrap does not style said buttons we have to use an anchor tag instead. But in order to maintain keyboard functionality for accessibility concerns even those anchor tags must provide an href. The solution is to add an internal SafeAnchor component which ensures that something exists for the href attribute, and calls event.preventDefault() when the anchor is clicked. It will then continue to invoke any additional onClick handler provided.",0

For example <Col xsOffset={2} xs={8} sm={4} md={4} lg={4}>...</Col> when viewed in 'sm/md/lg' does not produce the expected result of having a column width of '4'. It looks only correct when viewed in 'xs'. The example would have to be rewritten as <Col xs={8} xsOffset={2} sm={4} smOffset={0} md={4} mdOffset={0} lg={4} lgOffset={0}>...</Col> to render correctly in all views. However, Offset/Push/Pull property values were ran through a ""truthy"" check in Col.jsx. So when the property value was 0 the column would not render.

[changed] Move built components to lib directory,0.41336715,migrate components to restart/ui (73a559e),"In the past this library has suffered from accidentally pushing this repo directly to npm without the built components. There has been a separate repo to which the built source has been pushed and later deployed from. While the approach is feasible it prevents you from using the npm link feature, for easy testing of changes in your own application.  This should address concerns like #325, #218, and any others like them that I have missed. In particular this is the fix for an automated setup as mentioned in #292. If you are currently using components directly from this library, then you will need to change your reference path. For example require('react-bootstrap/Alert') should now be require('react-bootstrap/lib/Alert'). require('react-bootstrap').Alert will still work. This applies to both CommonJS and AMD usages.",0
