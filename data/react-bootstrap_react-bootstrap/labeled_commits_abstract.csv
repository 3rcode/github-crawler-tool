This is because Form.Check is currently relying on the presence of a label prop to apply the form-check class name to the wrapping , because checkboxes without labels don't need the wrapping element to have the form-check class name. This commit adds a utility to check whether an element has a child of a certain type. It then uses that utility to check if a Form.Check element has a Form.Check.Label child and takes that into account when determining whether the checkbox has a label. Adding a special property (currently called typeName, but that can certainly change) to components for this utility is necessary because React minifies the displayName property in production. Add error handling to includesType Support mixing auto and custom child components Currently, Form.Check doesn't allow users to use a custom Form.Check.Input with a label generated by the label prop (and requires that a custom Form.Check.Input be used if a custom Form.Check.Label is also used) because the presence of any children in Form.Check prevents automatic inputs and labels (and feedback) from generating. This approach allows mixing and matching by extracting any custom input, label, and feedback components from Form.Check's children prop, then separately for each, using the custom component if provided or an automatic component otherwise. Simply check child.type The type property of React elements have reference equality with matching imported component variables (JSXElementConstructor objects, to be precise)! For some reason I was not expecting that, but it makes sense to me now, since these constructor objects are being imported from a singular source, so there's no reason React would create multiple instances of them. So child.type === type all we need to check in getChildOfType; the typeName prop I added earlier is not at all needed. Add scripts for testing production build of docs Just as a convenience. I can revert this commit if these scripts aren't desired. Just check immediate children for FormCheckLabel Use correct variable Revert empty .husky/pre-commit change No idea how that got into 0754b49. Revert ""Add scripts for testing production build of docs"" This reverts commit 5343b0a8de88550fb4c5ecba0bded75e17f55505.",0

Bootstrap's docs on Alerts require the use of a contextual class (link/) in order to have proper styling. This aligns Alert and Badge variant functionality with that of Button and Navbar. This could be viewed as a breaking change (e.g. for someone using Alert without a variant [as it now adds one] or someone relying on Button's .btn-null [if the variant was null]).  However, I'm inclined to view this as a feature as it is adding & declaring functionality in the public API where behaviour wasn't previously explicitly defined in examples or docs.",0

But when we set animation={false} to Modal, the Transition object is not created and therefore onEnter (=handleEnter) is not called. This causes empty modal when animation set false (I think this is the issue #3399 ). This PR tries to fix this behavior by setting the modal's display style to block always. I think this doesn't break existing behavior because as @jquense says we don't allow modals to be in the DOM prior to showing  the modal's dom element doesn't exist before rendering. So I think it's safe to set display always block.",0

I think I've got a reasonable set of prop types for each module, but i got a bit tired of detailed checking towards the end. I'm not sure whether the polymorphic as behaviour actually works correctly - although in theory the types I've got there should handle it. Because of the generated types for the final component props, the error messages can be a bit wordy - but they do seem to also include the important information as well. I've added dtslint into the build, but unfortunately this only checks the types against the simple.test.tsx file, it doesn't check the types against the actual implementation in any way. Another mild annoyance is that although i've matched up the component filenames, the types don't work for the individual component files because of the lib vs src vs es part of the build process. In theory the files could be duplicated during the build for the exported code if this is desired.",0

3532,Merge pull request #4975 from HPS-RobRice/patch-1,0.49674022,v5: Drop InputGroupPrepend and InputGroupAppend (#5351) (8e73b63),"Bootstrap uses a lot of styling that is specifically targeting anchor tags that may also serve in the capacity as a button. Unfortunately since Bootstrap does not style said buttons we have to use an anchor tag instead. But in order to maintain keyboard functionality for accessibility concerns even those anchor tags must provide an href. The solution is to add an internal SafeAnchor component which ensures that something exists for the href attribute, and calls event.preventDefault() when the anchor is clicked. It will then continue to invoke any additional onClick handler provided.",0

There has been a separate repo to which the built source has been pushed and later deployed from. While the approach is feasible it prevents you from using the npm link feature, for easy testing of changes in your own application.  This should address concerns like #325, #218, and any others like them that I have missed. In particular this is the fix for an automated setup as mentioned in #292. If you are currently using components directly from this library, then you will need to change your reference path. For example require('react-bootstrap/Alert') should now be require('react-bootstrap/lib/Alert'). require('react-bootstrap').Alert will still work. This applies to both CommonJS and AMD usages.",0
