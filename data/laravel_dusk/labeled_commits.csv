This means we don't have to update the docs. I wrote this as an install command so we can remove the binaries in a future version of Dusk and always have them installed with this command. This will save having them to be packaged with the repo. It's also written in such a way that it only installs the binary for the current OS. Fixes https://github.com/laravel/dusk/issues/641,0

fix user phpDoc,0.3872447,Remove php-webdriver constraints (#737),"Hi, I noticed the following: the phpDoc for the user method claims that the method is supposed to return a Closure. However, on line 32 this method call is itself wrapped in a closure, which means that when Browser::$userResolver is actually called, it will return an instance of Closure instead of a user, and it will not be able to login successfully, throwing an ErrorException: Object of class Closure could not be converted to string. I changed the phpDoc signature for this method, so when someone wants to override it in their project, they won't get confused. The other option of course would be to remove the closure from the setUp method, but I didn't think it prudent to muck around with actual functionality here.",0

So here it is again. The stub as it is now extends Laravel\Dusk\Page instead of the abstract class Tests\Browser\Pages\Page included with a fresh installation of Dusk.  This means that any custom shortcuts defined in Tests\Browser\Pages\Page::siteElements() aren't available to tests. This has already broken one of my tests when I forgot to change the extends for a page.  So I'm submitting a PR changing the extends in this stub. Thanks for looking into this.",0
