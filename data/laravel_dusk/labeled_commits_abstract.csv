It has a flag that will also allow users to update every binary if they want. I've added this to the install command so the driver is updated whenever the install command is run. This means we don't have to update the docs. I wrote this as an install command so we can remove the binaries in a future version of Dusk and always have them installed with this command. This will save having them to be packaged with the repo. It's also written in such a way that it only installs the binary for the current OS. Fixes link,0

However, on line 32 this method call is itself wrapped in a closure, which means that when Browser::$userResolver is actually called, it will return an instance of Closure instead of a user, and it will not be able to login successfully, throwing an ErrorException: Object of class Closure could not be converted to string. I changed the phpDoc signature for this method, so when someone wants to override it in their project, they won't get confused. The other option of course would be to remove the closure from the setUp method, but I didn't think it prudent to muck around with actual functionality here.",0

This means that any custom shortcuts defined in Tests\Browser\Pages\Page::siteElements() aren't available to tests.
