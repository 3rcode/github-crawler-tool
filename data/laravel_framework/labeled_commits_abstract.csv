chore (logging): add stop_buffering config option (#44071),0.51255554,Allowed predefined log channels to change formatter from config (#26895),Adding the stop_buffering config option. The FingersCrossedHandler Logger will first start buffering log records until a record exceeds the configured action_level. When the action_level is exceeded the buffered records will be flushed to the provided log location. By default the FingersCrossedHandler will stop buffering log records after its first flush (due to the $stopBuffering property). All records pushed to the log handler afterwards will be flushed directly to the log location. With this config update the log handler can be configured to resume the buffering after a flush occurs. This can be useful for applications that rely heavily on gather debug log records which only are useful when an error logging is passed. In the old setup all the debug records after an error record would be flushed to the log location. @see link Co-authored-by: Wim Ulkeman wulkeman@assuradeurengilde.nl,0

[8.x] Increase reserved memory for error handling (#42646),0.78728706,Allocate memory for error handling to allow handling memory exhaustion limits (#29226),"Increase reserved memory for error handling Follow up to link The error handler should be able to report exceptions arising from exceeding the PHP memory limit. Because of changes made to error handling, the previously configured value is no longer sufficiently large. A similar change was also done in Symfony a while ago, see link. I used the following artisan command to determine the amount of memory required for error handling, using a reporter that simply writes to a file: ```php <?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\Console\Commands; use Illuminate\Console\Command; final class MeasureHandlerMemory extends Command {     protected $signature = 'measure-handler-memory'; private int $peak; public function handle(): void {     $this->peak = memory_get_peak_usage(); module } public function __destruct() {     $used = memory_get_peak_usage() - $this->peak;     echo ""error handling used: "" . $used . ""\n""; module } } ``` Free memory in HandleExceptions::handleShutdown() While validating the effectiveness of link in our application, I found that the call $error = error_get_last() causes a tiny bit of memory usage. Thus, I think it is better to clear memory as soon as entering the handler. Update HandleExceptions.php Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",1

Free reserved memory before handling fatal errors (#42630),0.9854002,"Free reserved memory before handling fatal errors (#42630, #42646)","When the PHP process exceeds the configured memory limit, a fatal error such as the following occurs: Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 3358976 bytes) Currently, the process abruptly exits in such cases without and indication as to what has caused the error. This is because the handler from register_shutdown_function() attempts to instantiate a FatalError instance, thus trying to use memory that is not available. This clears the reserved memory before this instantiation, thus ensuring that the process has enough memory to properly handle the error. Reserved memory is also cleared in handleException in the same way.",1

Fix migrations $connection property (#41161),0.94753075,Fix database migrations $connection property (#41161),"Despite being documented as allowing Schema queries to run on the given secondary connection, Schema::connection() must also be explicitly called to avoid up() and down() queries to be run on the default database connection. Instead this property is only used by the migrator when wrapping DB::transaction() & DB::pretend(). The queries still run on the default database connection (or the command option --database.) This change makes queries run using that $connection while not affecting the migrations repository. i.e., the connection for the migrations history table. If another Schema::connection() is called during up() or down(), that will be used instead of $connection. $connection also overrides MigrateCommand option '--database'. A breaking change is required to switch to the opposite behavior.",1

However single/double quote characters in such array configs aren't supported.

Resolve  Blueprint out of the container (#40307),0.5583349,Used BindingResolutionException to signal problem with container resolution (#32349),"Currently, it is almost impossible to swap the Blueprint $table implementation for migrations with a fake one from within a ""package space"". Because the Schema facade returns a new object each time from the getFacadeAccessor method (hence there is no way of mocking or hot swapping) and non of the other objects are resolved out of the container. (Connection objects or Builder objects) There is also no change of using the resolver property on the Builder class from a package space because if you set it before the migration starts it will be thrown away after the Schema is called in the migration. Currently ""illuminate/database"" depends on ""illuminate/container"" so we can use the Container class directly. This way it is possible to swap the Blueprint class upon the registration phase.",0

The Fingerscrossed handler will buffer all log records that are at or above the provided level configuration. Only when a log record is provided at or above the action_level all the buffered records will be flushed to the log itself.

This necessitated the creation of renderUnless(), because @includeUnless() accepts multiple arguments, and parsing out the first argument to a Blade directive is fraught. So renderUnless() takes the parameters as-is, and negates the condition inside the method. DRY renderUnless() by having it use renderWhen()",0

[8.x] Attribute Cast / Accessor Improvements (#40022),0.95981765,Attribute Cast / Accessor Improvements (#40022),"Summary This pull request adds a new way to define attribute ""accessors / mutators"" as they are currently called in the  documentation: link Currently, accessors and mutators are added to a model by defining get{Foo}Attribute and set{Foo}Attribute methods on the model. These conventionally named methods are then used when the developers attempts to access the $model->foo property on the model. This aspect of the framework has always felt a bit ""dated"" to me. To be honest, I think it's one of the least elegant parts of the framework that currently exists. First, it requires two methods. Second, the framework does not typically prefix methods that retrieve or set data on an object with get and set - it just hasn't been part of Laravel's style (e.g., $request->input() vs. $request->getInput(), $request->ip() vs. $request->getIp, etc. This pull request adds a way to define attribute access / mutation behavior in a single method marked by the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute return type. In combination with PHP 8+ ""named parameters"", this allows developers to define accessor and mutation behavior in a single method with fluent, modern syntax by returning an Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute instance: php /  * Get the user's title.  */ protected function title(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         get: fn ($value) => strtoupper($value),         set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),     ); } Accessors / Mutators & Casts As some might have noticed by reading the documentation already, Eloquent attribute ""casts"" serve a very similar purpose to attribute accessors and mutators. In fact, they essentially serve the same purpose; however, they have two primary benefits over attribute accessors and mutators. First, they are reusable across different attributes and across different models. A developer can assign the same cast to multiple attributes on the same model and even multiple attributes on different models. An attribute accessor / mutator is inherently tied to a single model and attribute. Secondly, as noted in the documentation, cast classes allow developers to hydrate a value object that aggregates multiple properties on the model (e.g. Address composed of address_line_one, address_line_two, etc.), immediately set a property on that value object, and then save the model like so: module The current, multi-method implementation of accessor / mutators currently does not allow this and it can not be added to that implementation minor breaking changes. However, this improved implementation of attribute accessing does support proper value object persistence in the same way as custom casts - by maintaining a local cache of value object instances: php /  * Get the user's address.  */ protected function address(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         get: fn ($value, $attributes) => new Address(             $attributes['address_line_one'],             $attributes['address_line_two'],             $attributes['city'],         ),         set: fn ($value) => [             'address_line_one' => $value->addressLineOne,             'address_line_two' => $value->addressLineTwo,             'city' => $value->city,         ],     ); } Mutation Comparison In addition, as you may have noticed, this implementation of accessors / mutators does not require you to manually set the properties in the $this->attributes array like a traditional mutator method requires you to. You can simply return the transform value or array of key / value pairs that should be set on the model: ""Old"", two-method approach: php public function setTitleAttribute($value) {     $this->attributes['title'] = strtolower($value); } New approach: php protected function title(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),     ); } FAQs What if I already have a method that has the same name as an attribute? Your application will not be broken because the method does not have the Attribute return type, which did not exist before this pull request. Will the old, multi-method approach of defining accessors / mutators go away? No. It will just be replaced in the documentation with this new approach.",1

[9.x] Manually populate POST request body with JSON data only when required (#37921),0.62395364,Skip parameter parsing for raw post body in HTTP Client (#42364),"Manually populate POST request body with JSON data only when required This fixes a 6 year old bug introduced in #7026 where GET requests would have GET data populated in the POST body property leading to issues around Request::post() and $request->getParsedBody() returning GET values when called on GET requests. This is a resubmit of #17087 & #36708, and fixes #22805. Credit to @dan-har for the initial solution and @mixlion for updating it for >=6.x. The original PR was meant to support POST requests where their Content-type was set to application/json (instead of the typical application/x-www-form-urlencoded), but it introduced a subtle and dangerous bug because while $request->getInputSource() does return the JSON data for JSON requests, it also returns the GET data for GET requests.

A HTTP response body can be: * status code: 200 HTTP OK * header: Content-Type: application/json * body: false Starting in v8.52.0, assertStatus() shows errors messages if any are found in a JSON response body. The TestResponse@json() method should be avoided since it applies additional key/value payload error checking unrelated to the HTTP status code. Instead silently detect JSON response body key 'errors' and only throw the ""Invalid JSON"" exception when Laravel's JSON assertion methods are called. Test assertStatus() on GZIP-encoded JSON Avoid exception ""Invalid JSON was returned from the route"" when the TestResponse class is unable to discover the JSON response body 'errors' key.

Improve the exception thrown when JSON encoding response contents fails,0.8085643,"Improve the exception thrown when JSON encoding response contents fails in Response::setContent() (#36851, #36868)","This improves on the opaque exception of ""The Response content must be a string or object implementing __toString(), “boolean” given."" that occurs whenever a call to $response->setContent($varThatFailsJsonEncoding) is made. It is difficult to debug the original exception, because to the developer they are not providing a boolean anywhere in their code, they are passing an array or an object to setContent() and expecting it to work; not knowing that Laravel internally tries to json_encode() that value before passing it along to Symfony, which only understands string values as response contents.

[8.x] Support useCurrentOnUpdate for MySQL datetime column types (#36817),0.5459359,Update Illuminate\Database\Schema\Grammars\MySqlGrammar::typeTimestamp() (#35143),"Support useCurrentOnUpdate for MySQL datetime column types This commit introduces support useCurrentOnUpdate for MySQL datetime column types.  MySQL has supported using ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for DATETIME columns since v5.6.5.  Laravel currently previously only supported useCurrentOnUpdate for TIMESTAMP columns in MySQL. We set the fractional seconds precision to be consistent throughout the column initialization (for the column type, the default, and the on update).  MySQL requires that the precision be identical throughout.  Note that this implicitly fixed a (likely rare) bug when users tried to run something like ->dateTime('foo', 2)->useCurrent(). Previously this would result in MySQL error code 1067 for invalid default values.  It will not set the default to have the same precision as the column definition. The actual code was borrowed heavily from typeTimeStamp.  Since they are distinct column types, it felt incorrect to DRY it up despite their similarities. Relevant MySQL documentation: MySQL 5.6 MySQL 5.7 MySQL 8.0 Use single quotes instead of double quotes when possible",0

[8.x] Fix issues with dumping PostgreSQL databases that contain multiple schemata (#36046),0.6160935,Changing the dump and restore method for a PostgreSQL database (#34293),"Eliminate the need for search_path logic The PostgreSQL search_path logic that this commit removes was added with the intention of enabling support for a schema named anything other than ""public"". While the theory was sound, the implementation didn't take into account the behavior in databases in which multiple schemas exist. In multi-schema databases, the list of tables for which data should not be dumped was incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. This revised approach takes advantage of PostgreSQL's support for pattern-based object references when specifying the list of tables for which data should not be dumped, and eliminates the need to perform complex search_path parsing altogether. The attendant Pull Request documentation explains how this technique works in detail. Re-implement pg_restore fix that was reverted link was fixed in a previous commit, but appears to have been lost during subsequent edits in link . This commit restores the changes made in link . Fixes #36054 Fix PostgreSQL object reference pattern quoting While not required in a psql interactive terminal, this pattern requires outer double-quotes to function as intended when passed as a CLI argument. While simple in this specific instance, pattern quoting can grow complicated (depending on the pattern), but is well explained in the PostgreSQL manual: link",0

"Added EncryptCookies to the priority list. It needs to be run before StartSession, which has a priority. This normally works fine, until the user adjusts the middleware list to include at least 2 prioritised middlewares in the 'wrong' order, after which SortMiddleware puts all prioritized middleware at the front of the list.

[6.x] GitHub Actions will run test suite in Windows (#33054),0.3993367,Publish console stub when running stub:publish command (#32096),"Github Actions run test suite in Windows Only once run on PHP 7.4 with the   latest stable Composer packages installed.   The Linux strategy matrix will discover   issues in PHP 7.2 & 7.3. Don't install PHP extension 'pcntl'   that isn't available on Windows. Some extensions must be explicitly setup   on Windows. e.g., pdo_mysql, fileinfo, ftp php.ini 'memory_limit' must be increased   128M to 512M when running all PHPUnit tests   synchronously. Some GitHub Actions workflow configs   don't work in Windows because containers   only work on Linux: MySQL server Redis server. There are no native Windows     binaries for Redis so a clone like Memurai     would have to be manually setup. Memcached   The above absent services will cause some   tests to be skipped. Skip CI-only tests when running Windows   Server 2019 since mysqld.exe isn't available. Further increase testRetry*()'s margin of error   for assertEqualsWithDelta(). The call is meant   to be delayed 100ms but Github Actions' virtual   env returns up to 110.3ms. Bump league/flysystem 1.0.8 to 1.0.34 FilesystemAdapterTest::testPath() fails when run on Windows using 1.0.8. A Windows-only change added in 1.0.34 meets the behavior Laravel expects for file paths. Fix brittle FilesystemTest on Windows w/ PHP 7.2 The test cases re-using subdirectory DIR.'/tmp/foo' causes issues when running PHP 7.2 on Windows. The kernel's directory deletetion operating is async so the next PHPUnit test case is starting before directory deletion has completed for the previous test. create DIR.'/tmp' only once for    FilesystemTest by using PHPUnit @beforeClass    and @afterClass annotations. make each test use a unique subdirectory name    so there is no overlap / leakage between tests    when mkdir() is called.",0

It's for the exact same reason as outlined in link : This is motivated by the fact that in tests, when using the RefreshDatabase trait, transactions events are dispatched and may interfer with the application testing itself when it relies on events like these ( for further info, see link ). As to not have custom handling of transaction events interfere with the test suite itself, this simply disables this. Again, the same change was added to RefreshDatabase and is still present; this PR merely keeps the behaviour of them in sync in regards to the handling of events in transactions.",0

As it turns out, old regex had a bug where it wouldn't accept urls where domain was a hostname ending with a digit. As such, the urls like link/ would be considered as invalid. To fix this issue I've updated \Illuminate\Validation\Concerns\ValidatesAttributes::validateUrl method using regex derived from version 5.0.7 of the Symfony Validator component.

Schema Dump (#32275),0.62096304,Load schema to in memory database (#45375),"This PR adds support for a new php artisan schema:dump command which uses mysqldump or pgdump to dump the current state of your schema to a database/schema/{connection}-schema.mysql file. When this file exists and php artisan migrate or php artisan migrate:fresh is run AND no migrations have run against the database yet (migrations table is empty), this schema file will be loaded into the database first and then any outstanding migrations will be run. This means that effectively this schema file would typically only ever be used during local development or during CI testing. In production, you would typically already have migrations that have run in the past so this schema file would never be triggered. Once the schema file is created, any or all of your existing migrations my be deleted as long as they have already run against your production environment. They are no longer needed during local development since the schema file exists. For convenience, a --prune flag has been added to the schema:dump command to delete your existing migrations after dumping the schema. This new feature solves two problems. First, it relieves developers from having a huge migrations directory full of files they no longer need. Second, loading a single schema file is quicker than running hundreds of migrations for each test class in your applications, so your tests can run much faster when using a schema.",0

Avoid deadlock in test when sharing process group (#32067),0.99999994,Avoid deadlock in test when sharing process group (#32067),"The testSharedGet test spawns child processes and waits for them to exit. The main process will wait for all child processes in its own process group. While this usually works, the processes involved in the test case are not necessarily the only processes in their process group. Should PHPUnit itself be executing in a child process, its parent process will also be there, causing a deadlock. This change will move the main test process into its own process group before forking to avoid the aforementioned situation.",1

Specify dynamic attribute casts at query-time,0.601663,Attribute Cast Performance Improvements (#43554),"This pull request allows additional (or replacement) attribute casts to be specified on the Eloquent query builder, such that they apply only to the results of that query. The primary use case for this functionality is to apply casts to columns resulting from subqueries or joins, that are not usually present on the model. While adding the aliases for those columns to the $casts array on the model does work, I feel that polluting the model with columns that are simply not present most of the time is not ideal, especially when the actual definition of those column names are likely to be spread across many different files. Consider the following query selecting Users along with the date of their most recent Post: php User     ::select([         'users.',         'last_posted_at' => Post::selectRaw('MAX(created_at)')             ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')     ])     ->get(); While User’s own timestamps will be cast to Carbon instances, last_posted_at will simply be a string. Currently, the only way to cast this would be to add last_posted_at to either $casts or $dates on User, despite the column only being present for this one specific query. This PR allows the following: php User     ::select([         'users.',         'last_posted_at' => Post::selectRaw('MAX(created_at)')             ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')     ])     ->withCasts(['last_posted_at' => 'date'])     ->get(); where the array of casts will be merged into any existing casts specified on the model. Naming wise I’m not sure if “withCasts” is the best option; I’ve just gone along with the likes of “withCount”.",0
Fix can't insert float into MySQL with PHP 7.3,0.49954754,Reverted Wrapped MySQL default values in parentheses (#29943),"When inserting a float value into MySQL via the Illuminate\Database package when using at least PHP 7.3, the value is converted to an int. The bug has been reported a few times before: 30435 illuminate/database#246 PR #16069 introduced logic to the MySQLConnection that cast floats to ints to address a comparison problem with JSON columns, which was reported in issue #16063. This does not seem to cause a problem with PHP 7.1 and below but causes the float to lose it's decimal places when using PHP 7.3. I have not tested with PHP 7.2. Given we have the following MySQL table: CREATE TABLE module (   module varchar(255) NOT NULL,   module decimal(15,10) NOT NULL,   module decimal(15,10) NOT NULL ) When we execute the following using Artisan Tinker: module Then we should see both records with -0.2 as the latitude. But only the first has the value, and the second row is zero.",0

[7.x] Custom Cast Types + Object / Value Object Casts (#31035),0.7150871,ArrayObject + Collection Custom Casts (#36245),"This adds the ability to write your own custom casts. These can cast to simple primitive values like strings (like an encrypted string) or to objects. When casting to objects, you have the opportunity to sync the object's values back into the model before saving.  Objects that cast attributes must implement the Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes contract or CastsInboundAttributes. This CastsAttributes interface defines a get and set method.  For example, a JSON caster that replicates the built-in JSON casting offered by Laravel would look like the following: ```php <?php use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes; class JsonCaster implements CastsAttributes {     public function get($model, $key, $value, $attributes)     {         return json_decode($value, true);     } public function set($model, $key, $value, $attributes) {     return json_encode($value); } } modulephp <?php use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes; class AddressCaster implements CastsAttributes {     public function get($model, $key, $value, $attributes)     {         return new Address(             $attributes['address_line_one'],              $attributes['address_line_two']         );     } public function set($model, $key, $value, $attributes) {     return [         'address_line_one' => $value->lineOne,          'address_line_two' => $value->lineTwo     ]; } } ``` When defined this way, you may update the address object properties and then save the model. The object's properties will be synced back to the model before saving: php $user->address->lineOne = 'New Line 1'; $user->save();",1

Handle toJson properly on json resources (#30801),0.62826884,Avoid constructor call when fetching resource JSON options (#40261),At the moment when you call toJson on a Json resource it skips the toArray method and directly calls toJson on the Eloquent model because of the ForwardsCalls trait. This seems unwanted because if you're formatting the resource in a specific way through the toArray method you'd expect it to be honered when calling toJson I believe. toJson isn't documented on the Json Resources documentation but I still believe that this should be honered. This is technically a breaking change so I'm targeting the next release.,0

[7.x] Fix regressions on find* methods with Arrayable ids (#30312),0.6071195,Implemented parse ID on find method for many to many relation (#30359),"Ensure Builder::findOrFail with Arrayable throws ModelNotFoundException I found a regression in #7048 and #19019, where the Eloquent Builder will not throw a ModelNotFoundException when an Arrayable is passed to findOrFail. In this #7048, we are checking if the $ids is an array and we count the results against the number of ids. But since #19019, the find method also accepts an Arrayable for the ids. So if an Arrayable is passed, the check is skipped and the method returns the results. To fix this, we are first checking if the $ids is an  Arrayable and we convert the ids to an array before checking the results. Ensure find* methods on relationships are accepting Arrayable idsThe regression in #7048 and #19019 is also observed in #9143, because the find,  findMany and findOrFail methods are copied from the Eloquent Builder to the BelongsToMany and HasManyThrough relations.For this reason, we need to convert the passed ids to an array before executing the queries.",0

The motivation for adding this clarity to the other ‘diff using’ function docs is: 1) to make it a little more difficult for someone looking at the diff functions to get confused 2) to align the docblocks on all these functions with the arguably better precedent set by diffUsing on Enumerable Also do the triple-space docblock param fix in Enumerable that I missed",0

It assumes that associative elements of $parameters that haven't already been inserted in replaceNamedParameters() are query-string parameters and should not be replaced in the URL-path. Instead of using array_shift($parameters) to get the next parameter element, we use Arr::pull($parameters, 0) to pull the first non-associative element. For this to work iteratively we need to reset the numeric keys every time using $parameters = array_merge($parameters)",1

Since ""flushing"" a DynamoDb table is not exactly ""supported"", we will need to recommend users configure a TTL on the expires_at attribute which will take care of pruning off old jobs over time.",0

Replace Application contract with Container,0.5463929,Service Container,This is a follow-up for link Mior correctly noted that Managers only need to have a container instance to function properly. The fact that the default container we inject here is an instance of the Laravel application is an implementation detail. This PR contains no breaking changes other than renaming the $app property to $container. The new type-hint still allows for the current Application instance to be passed through but makes it clear that this could be any implementation of a container. I've also made $config a dedicated property on the Manager class as it's widely used on our own adapters. This makes it easy to reference it. The container array calls were replaced by make methods because ArrayAccess isn't part of the Container contract (and it shouldn't be).,0

This is part of making the community aware that for most cases Manager doesn't not require an implementation of Application contracts and Container should be sufficient such as being used by Lumen.

Implement better email validation support,0.788247,Implement new types for email validation support (#29589),"These changes allow for multiple email validators to be added when checking for valid emails. This is a continuation of the previous PR: link Basically this allows for two things: Make use of multiple email validators provided by the egulias/email-validator package Use the previous (and much requested) filter_var validation By default nothing's breaking because it'll still use the RFC validator to when no validators are passed to the email validation rule. But you can opt to include different ones or multiple ones: 'email' => 'email:rfc,dns' Or opt for the pre-5.8 behavior: 'email' => 'email:filter' Which will use filter_var to validate the email address. This should give people a little more flexibility when doing email validation.",1

Remove new password validation from broker,0.5588814,Prevent authentication if password is the only specified field (#22167),These changes remove all hardcoded valdation from the PasswordBroker. The reason for this is because this is a hardcoded constraint in validation and thus limits people from building password reset forms with their specific flow. The validation is already done within the ResetsPassword trait and is only duplicated in the Broker. The Broker also seems like the wrong place to do this as it only facilitates the retrieval of the user and the token validation (which is still the correct place for these two). This also allows us to remove the link language line. See link,0

Remove duplicate password length check,0.5866659,Improve password checks (#42248),This removes duplicate (and hardcoded) length check from the PasswordBroker. At the moment this is duplicated in the ResetsPasswords trait where it can be customized by overwriting the rules method and the PasswordBroker where it cannot be adjusted. A length of 8 is a sensible default to have (see link) but allowing people to overwrite when needed allows people to modify as they see fit. I've left the rules in user land (laravel/laravel repo & ResetsPassword trait) as is because it still makes sense to ship with a default length in user land.,0

What it basically does is make the JSON file lookup take precedence over the directory based PHP translation files. The __ helper becomes an alias of the trans helper. It basically doesn't breaks much. The get call lookup will now first look at the JSON files to find a translation. If it doesn't finds it, it applies the previous get behavior and performs a lookup in the PHP translation files.

Fix columns parameter on paginate method,0.59159756,Add option to create macroable method for paginationInformation (#46461),"This is currently broken and will throw a SQL exception: DB::table('posts')->paginate(5, ['title', 'content']); At the moment when you attempt to pass specific columns on the paginate method on the base query builder it will fail when you provide more than one column. SQL queries can only handle a count for a specific column and not multiple ones. That's why it's unwanted to pass along the columns parameter from the paginate method to the getCountForPagination method. Since we just want to do a count of the current result set a simple count with the '*' sign is enough. At the moment the Eloquent builder already handles pagination in this way. It's noted by Staudenmeier that the only difference is when you provide a specific column to the getCountForPagination method is that it'll only count non-NULLs. However, it's not feasible to allow this to be done in combination with the paginate method because the columns param on the paginate method soley exists to filter which columns will be retrieved in the paginated result set (which is currently broken thus). See link I've added an extra integration test which reproduces the problem at hand. I've updated the tests in the DatabaseQueryBuilderTest class to reflect the changes made to getCountForPagination call. This has been a long outstanding issue so hopefully this will prevent more issues from popping up. Fixes link",0

The path is now applied as the final piece of code. This doesn't allows IDE's to rely on it being the last line though.

Before that PR, the arguments were spread out before being passed to the callbacks, so the user and the ability were merged with the other arguments, before being passed to the callback. Since then, the arguments are being passed as an array, so instead of merging the user and the ability with the array of arguments, which is superfluous, we can directly pass the user, the ability, and the arguments directly to the callback. This commit doesn't change the existing functionality, and it keeps backwards compatibility. I have also added some assertions to the tests, since the arguments in the before callbacks were never tested.",0

update blade JSON directive,0.60422486,Fix blade tag issue with nested calls (#45764),"The @json directive does not compile properly if there are 3 or more commas in the expression. For example: @json([     'value1',     'value2',     'value3', ]) This is due to the Blade compiler exploding the expression by commas, and assuming the 2nd and 3rd segments are the 'options' and 'depth', respectively. This change takes what is given in the ""expression"" and passes it through unaltered to compile to PHP.  This gives the user full control over what ends up in the compiled output, and does not limit what they can put in the first argument. This does, however, remove the default encoding options if a user fails to pass a second argument through. This is an undocumented feature. Tests are updated to reflect the change, and new tests are added to make sure the ""value"" argument can contain commas and functions.",0

Show displayable values for relative dates in validation error messages,0.658458,Support date validation rules when comparison has relative time (#23211),"Currently the after, after_or_equal, before, before_or_equal and date_equals validation rules allow us to use relative keywords in english to compare dates, e.g. date_equals:tomorrow. When the placeholders are replaced in the validation messages, the :date parameter is normally replaced if it references another attribute, e.g. after:start_date but not when it's a relative keyword. This is an issue when the locale is other than english: e.g. the date_equals:tomorrow in french is translated to Le champ date doit être une date égale à tomorrow. This commit allows for developers to specify custom translation for these values. E.g. in fr/validation.php: php 'values' => [     'date' => [         'tomorrow' => 'demain',     ], ], So now the validation message will be translated to Le champ date doit être une date égale à demain.",0

Rename cache seconds to TTL,0.56479114,Update forever cache duration for database driver from minutes to seconds (#28048),These changes will rename the cache seconds on the Repository interface and its implementations to $ttl rather than seconds. The reason behind this is because the TTL can be more than seconds. It can be an instance of DateTimeInterface and DateInterval as well. Overall it also makes the internals a bit clearer so a call like this: $seconds = $this->getSeconds($seconds); Becomes the following which makes more sense: $seconds = $this->getSeconds($ttl); No changes were made to the cache stores themselves because these always accept integers/seconds so it's more appropriate to leave these as is.,0

Fix PSR-16 TTL conformity,0.6133089,Improved PSR-11 implementation (#25870),"These changes to the Cache Repository interface and implementation will make our cache implementation compliant with the PSR-16 standard's TTL requirements. It contains some significant changes in how we handle and store cache values. The main change that was done is that now a TTL with a value of NULL will be considerd an attempt to store the item forever. In addition to this, any value with a TTL equal or lower than zero will be considerd an attempt to remove the item from the cache. The put, putMany and add methods were updated to reflect these changes. Before these changes a request like Cache::put('foo', 'bar') wouldn't do anything since a NULL TTL meant that the call was simply ignored. Now any request without a specified TTL will have the default TTL of NULL and thus the request is considered to attempting to store the item forever. For the putMany call a NULL TTL now means that every single item will be stored forever individually. As there isn't a putManyForever equivalent on the Repository or the PSR interface, there was no way to tell a cache store to store the given items in one go. For the add call, the behavior to ignore the call when a zero or less TTL was given is kept but when a NULL TTL is now passed, it's correctly passed to the cache store. This will ignore a custom add method on the cache store as any NULL TTL simply could be considered to re-store the item indefinitely. No changes were made to the cache stores themselves. Only the Repository was modified. This way, the cache stores keep their current behavior as theyaren't implementations of the PSR Simple Cache interface. All in all these changes will now make us conform with the PSR specs much better.",0

Together with link this now works (assume ▌is the cursor): php $user = User::findOrFail(123); $user->na▌// Pressing tab here autocompletes to module Also works with collections: php $users = User::findOrFail([123,456]); foreach ($users as $user) {     $user->na▌// Pressing tab here autocompletes to module } Previously this only worked with an explicit editor specific type hint, e.g. /* @var User $user /. Furhter,  static was added to firstOrFail() or static[] to get() and it beautifully works with IDEs but not so much for findOrFail. It's not perfect due to the polymorphic behaviour of findOrFail returning different ""kind of things"", but it's better then having no autocomplete helper at all.",0

[5.5] Validation bypass for 'before' and 'after' rules when paired with 'date_format' rule. (#24191),0.94684446,Validation bypass for before and after rules when paired with date_format rule (#24191),"Add more tests to Validator's before and after rules. When the rules before and/or after are used together with the date_format rules, the validator should give preference to validate a given field relative to the fixed date specified in the rule, instead of comparing to a field with the same name as the specified date. Fix validation bypass for rules 'before' and 'after' when paired with 'date_format'. Now when when there is both a 'date_format' rule and a 'before' and/or 'after' rule, the first parameter will be converted to a timestamp, and only if that fails, it will be considered as a name for another field.

Implemented: Multi-driver logging support so you can have multiple logging channels per app. ""Pipes"" in @phroggyy's pull request have been re-worked as ""taps"". Allows customization of logging channel post-creation. Continued support for functionality provided by configureMonologUsing maintained using custom driver type with factory invokable that returns any PSR3 compatible logger. This allows full customization of entire logging channel. I decided not to implement Log::event functionality from PR because I think that would be better suited for something like a ShouldLog interface on the event itself (to complement ShouldBroadcast, etc.). Primary breaking changes: New log configuration file / settings. configureMonologUsing now custom driver type. Illuminate\Contracts\Log removed. Was literal duplication of PSR3 logging interface.

Check for --no-interaction flag on command calls,0.9574561,"Check for --no-interaction flag on command calls (#22515, ba5e31d)","Currently, calling an artisan command from another artisan command as described in the docs ($this->call(...)) does not allow the --no-interaction flag to be set on the command (or rather, you can set it, but it won't have any effect unless the called command specifically checks for it). The current workaround is to use the Artisan facade.  This was raised in the Adldap2-Laravel repo:  link This PR solves the issue by explicitly checking for the --no-interaction flag (but not the shorthand -n flag) to set the interactive mode of the new input in the same manner symfony/application sets it in Application::configureIO:  link An alternative would be to check if the current command is being run in non-interactive mode, but I think that would have a higher chance of breaking existing code. This way, the only way to break existing code is if someone is using the --no-interaction argument in a command call and somehow still expecting interaction. Avoiding BC breaks is also the reason I've omitted the -n short syntax, as it is plausible that people may have developed commands that are being called exclusively by other commands and have their own meaning for -n without knowing it's intended purpose.",1

Added date validator tests for time fields This shows that the fix in 1b651e67349823b2e820da6f6b45c1399a4a6d25 is not going to break applications, people can still use the time part.

[5.4] Can't Wrap DB Names Containing Spaces When Aliasing (#17312),0.58511794,"Alternative database name in Postgres DSN, allow pgbouncer aliased databases to continue working on 9.x (#43542)","Can't Wrap DB Names Containing Spaces When Aliasing Database names containing spaces are perfectly legal in Microsoft SQL Server. Currently, when using SQL Server, if you have a database which includes spaces, the grammar handles wrapping it fine. So this: My Sample Database.dbo.my_table.my_column Correctly becomes: [My Sample Database].[dbo].[my_table].[my_column] But if you also try to alias a column when the database contains spaces, it breaks. This: My Sample Database.dbo.my_table.my_column AS my_aliased_column Becomes: [My] AS [Sample] I have traced the error to Database/Grammar/wrapAliasedValue() using explode( ' ' ) - the code thinks the spaces in the database name are the spaces around the ""AS"". We can fix this by using regex instead of explode, splitting on the ""AS"" more accurately. Just replace the explode with this: $segments = preg_split( '/\s+as\s+/i', $value ); Note: When you have an Eloquent belongsToMany method that has to include the database name (eg. we need to join across DBs), this type of alias is created automatically, generating this error. I originally committed this to 5.3 (link) and was asked to commit here instead. Adding Tests RE: link",0

Remove event priorities.,0.6402096,Run event:clear on optimize:clear (a61b24c2),"The whole concept of event priorities doesn’t make sense as a concept and can’t even be trusted as an end user because you are relying on the exact order of listeners. Priority also makes no sense in modern apps where many events may be queued. Can be implemented as a synchronous pipeline. Also removed halting events as this suffers from same problem of relying on the exact order and implementation of your events, depending on no handlers being queued, etc. Should use other pattern when this is needed.",0

Refactor container. Remove old features.,0.59431463,⚠️ Refactored Container (#19201),"This is a moderate refactoring of the container to clean up code and remove some legacy features that haven’t been documented in several years. The make() method no longer accepts a second argument of parameters - needing this feature indicates a code smell and you can always construct the object in another way. It simply complicated the container and code and made it hard to read. Secondly, the share() method has been removed. This method was an old method to provide backwards compatibility with Pimple. It has not been documented in a few years and the more popular “singleton()” method is easier to use. Thirdly, the Normalize() method has been removed. This is the most called method in all of Laravel and it is called almost 1,000 times on every request because of the heavy usage of the container. On a fresh opcache enabled run of Laravel it is actually uses about 8-9% of the entire request processing time. It’s whole purpose is to allow you to bind objects into the container with a leading slash; however, Foo::class never returns a leading slash and if you pass a string we can simply document that a leading slash should not be provided.",0
Bind serve cmd to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost (#16937),0.6858256,Set custom host to the serve command with environment variable (#41831),"On latest Mac (Sierra) and perhaps earlier, localhost is using the ipv6 network. This creates behavior like the following: module This is probably a confusing error for those hitting it when using 127.0.0.1. We can make sure we bind to ipv4 by either binding to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1.  Binding to 127.0.0.1 is safer of course, and doesn't really change expected behavior (since ipv6 is not prevalent still and we're just talking localhost networks here). This change would behave like this: module Other OS considerations: Windows: localhost often checks ipv6 first and then goes to ipv4 if nothings listening on v6. This creates considerable lag, so using 127.0.0.1 may work better on Windows as well Linux: I don't believe this is default behavior on even newer versions of Linux, but since we're talking about localhost networks in any case, I don't see any reason not to assume ipv4 over ipv6 would be the expected localhost network to use",0

"Added a filter to get only the file inputs called with this->attach(input, value)",0.446822,Attach all disk attachments and not only first one in the Mail/Mailable.php (#25793),"Note: This only happens when running tests. If you are submitting a form that has input file fields and don't attach any file on those inputs it will send those as normal inputs with a value of null causing a validation exception if any of those fields have a validation rule of any kind (except required). This happens because on how validation of null fields are handled now in 5.3. If you don't expect those fields to be nullable, you'll have to add the 'nullable' validation rule to make your test pass. I think there is no use in sending empty file fields as normal inputs with a value of null. This filter prevents sending empty input file fields as normal inputs with a null value.

Because in Larvel's combined input system, the body items take precedence over query string items. If an item appears in the body that uses the same key as the one being used for the API token, then this body item is then assumed to be the token which could lead to authentication errors especially if the key is being set to a more generic custom name with a high risk of conflict, e.g. 'password'.

Throw ModelNotFoundException when model bind not found,0.6367617,"Better exception message when calling non existing methods on models (#20196, 91c1f03)","This is a PR for Issue #13455 to bring consistency to model bind not found and findOrFail. The NotFoundHttpException was changed to a ModelNotFoundException and has the model set, the exact same as in Eloquent/Builder findOrFail. Although the Exceptions/Handler.php converts this back to a NotFoundHttpException in the prepareException method anyway (so thus should have same behaviour for projects using the default handling), by throwing a ModelNotFoundException in the first instance has the added benefit that a custom Handler subclass can render both cases of a model binding not found and a findOrFail in the same way. Furthermore, by having an exception that has the model name set on it, exception handling can be even more improved for binding failures, e.g. by default there is now the message ""No query results for model [App\ModeClass]."" instead of no message. This message is exactly the same as the exception from findOrFail since it is created inside the ModelNotFoundException itself. Before this fix, developers had to workaround this issue by providing a closure to return the correct exception on all their route models via a closure, although in the example given in this forum post, the developer didn't set the model on the exception: link",0

Account for __isset changes in PHP 7,0.5245289,Simplified isset() (#29581),"Update: this is a revised PR after speaking with Taylor about the intended behavior and possible solutions. PHP 7 has fixed a bug with __isset which affects both the native isset and empty methods. This causes specific issues with checking isset or empty on relations in Eloquent. In PHP 7 checking if a property exists on an unloaded relation, for example isset($this->relation->id) is always returning false because unlike PHP 5.6, PHP 7 is now checking the offset of each attribute before chaining to the next one. In PHP 5.6 it would eager load the relation without checking the offset. This change brings back the intended behavior of the core Eloquent model __isset method for PHP 7 so it works like it did in PHP 5.6. For reference, please check the following link, specifically Nikita Popov's comment (core PHP dev) - link",0

Drastically reduce overhead in Blade comment matching,0.5453425,remove comments before compiling components in the BladeCompiler (2964d2d),"Prior to this change, a capture group was being created for every single character in the comment. For any comments over 1024 characters (not uncommon when commenting out a chunk of markup), PHP 7 would fail to match the regex due to hitting a JIT stack limit. Adding the s modifier tells the regex engine to include newline characters when matching the dot character and allows us to remove the inner capture group. This drastically reduces the amount of memory the regex uses and keeps it well within the JIT stack limit for typical uses. This increases the limit for comment length up to approximately 1 million characters, instead 1024.",0

Issue #11649 Custom Auth Provider Fix,0.600936,Made the user provider parameter on RequestGuard optional (d7f0b26),"It looks like PasswordBrokerManager.php is not finding custom Authentication user providers. See issue #11649. It looks like on line 11 it uses use CreatesUserProviders then on line 73 it creates a new PasswordBroker. This issue arrises because PasswordBrokerManager is using a trait and referring to an array on the trait that is instantiated on AuthManager. Since it is a trait it is creating a brand new empty array on PasswordBrokerManager which causes issues. I am not familiar enough with the framework to know if this is the best way to fix this, but it works and will at least get you pointed in the right direction.",0

Make formatErrors() adhere to contracts,0.5307771,⚠️ Don't set formatter on ErrorLogHandler (a044f17),"This change makes the implementation of FormRequest::formatErrors() method adhere to the Validator and MessageBag contracts. Note that the behavior is exactly the same, because getMessageBag() is just an alias for errors() and the same holds for toArray() and getMessages(). However, errors() and getMessages() are not in the contracts, while the method typehints the Validator interface. So without this change, if you would want to swap the implementation of Validator or MessageBag to a custom one, FormRequest breaks. This change also improves IDE navigation.",0

This leads to issues when type hinting on the Gate interface as methods are not defined in the type hinted type object: public function update(GateContract $gate) {     $gate->allows('post-user'); } This either limits the implementation being used to the provided one or forces the use of the check method when type hinting the interface which is often less clear than the explicit allows / denies methods. There are other methods which are public but not on the contract but it appears as though they are intended to be internal and as such should be marked protected. This change does not address these methods. This change adds the four documented methods in the public api to the Gate contract.",0

Fix Pivot When Is Force Filled,0.63150406,Use fill instead of forceFill while storing pivot attributes (#21403),"This is related to Issue 10243. When an instance of Pivot is created and date attributes such as created_at and updated_at at passed it tried to convert those to a Carbon instance using the connection’s sql grammar from the parent. As the time the pivot is being filled, no table neither connection is already set by the parent model, so the pivot resolves a grammar from the default connection. The fix consist on moving $this->setTable($table); and $this->setConnection($parent->getConnectionName()); before $this->forceFill($attributes); on the Pivot’s class constructor. I tried to change the testPropertiesAreSetCorrectly test in DatabaseEloquentPivotTest.php to reproduce the use case, as the current test does not test that. But got an error from PHP Unit pointing to this method in the Model class: /*  * Get the format for database stored dates.  *  * @return string  / protected function getDateFormat() {     return $this->dateFormat ?: $this->getConnection()->getQueryGrammar()->getDateFormat(); } I think this is related to the mocking instance, but my testing knowledge is not enough to fix it.

Of course it requires some configuration of your PostgreSQL instance to make it work. I've tested this with the database config value 'require' to make the SSL connection mandatory and setting hostssl in pg_hba.conf for all connections.  Possible sslmode values depend on the version of the pgsql library: 'disable', 'allow', 'prefer', 'require', 'verify-ca', 'verify-full'. The default value is 'prefer'. The value 'require' is backwards compatible. For further info check the PostgreSQL docs: link",0

Large cleanup,0.4467412,Cleanup html (#28583),"This commit is a large cleanup throughout the framework. Changes are: Put use statements on separate rules Fix some variable positioning in docblocks Import dependencies with use statement rather then using them directly with their namespace in a class Fixed an incorrect @param statement on a property docblock Fixed some incorrect return types Replaced stdClass with ""object"" (see note below) Replaced a static::make with a new Illuminate Response call in the Response facade (to be in line with the other functions) Added dependencies to the start function in the workbench Starter class The reason why I replaced stdClass with ""object"" throughout all of the docblocks is because it isn't correct. Stating that you expect stdClass means that you don't expect any other class except stdClass which is wrong. You need to indicate it as ""object"" so you can expect different types of classes. A prime example is the migrator class where some functions expect a migration class. Those classes aren't stdClasses but they are objects. Remember: all stdClasses are objects but not all objects are stdClasses. Signed-off-by: Dries Vints dries.vints@gmail.com",0

Creation of the setBaseURL function for Ajax requests,0.4809792,Do not prepend baseUrl to absolute urls by @JaZo in link,"When using pagination in an Ajax request is useful to be able to define the URL to be consider to build the paginate links. By default, in an  Ajax request, it will be consider the Ajax URL to build the paginate links. This is a problem because generally in an Ajax response we do not rebuild the entry HTML page. To resolve this problem, we add to the Paginator class the setBaseURL function to indicate the URL to be consider. With this change we can, for example, proceed in the following way in the context of an Ajax request: echo ‘’; $users = User:where(‘age’, ‘>’, ’18‘)->get(); foreach ($users as $user) {     echo ‘’.$user->name.‘’; } $users->setBaseUrl(URL::route(‘users_list’)); echo ‘’; $users->links(); We can use the function $users->getEnvironment()->setBaseUrl() but we think the previous solution much more simple an elegant.",0

To accomplish this we change the take function in order to consider the value 0 as to retrieve all the founded objects. Without this change we have always to implement the previous function like this: public function getUsersByName ($name, $limit = 0)  { if ($limit = 0) { return User::where('name', 'like', '%'.$name'%')->get(); } else { return User::where('name', 'like', '%'.$name'%')->take($limit)->get(); } }",0

Detach before attach to prevent uniqueness constraint conflicts,0.52792144,Stop adding constraints twice on Many to One relationships via one() (#46575),"Example: You have a uniqueness constraint on id and position on the pivot table. You have a list of items and each items has a position in the list hence the position field on the pivot. You would like to remove one item from the bottom of the list and then add another one in it's place. You do this in a form, and get back a json object that has the new desired list of items. You would now like to sync this json object up with the db so you use sync(). Now sync() will try to attach a new item with a position of 3, but that position already exists and an exception is thrown. By first detaching the old item in position 3 and then attaching the new one this conflict is removed. Signed-off-by: Andreas Heiberg git@andreas-heiberg.com",0

Update src/Illuminate/Routing/UrlGenerator.php,0.73860806,Changed Illuminate/Routing/Route::controllerMiddleware() (#44590),"This allows properly formatted path parameters to be used (those beginning with a trailing slash; e.g. ""/path/to/page"" & the root ""/""), without breaking past compatibility by still allowing (""path/to/page""). These path parameters are used in methods such as URL::to('/page'), Redirect::to('/page'), etc. Also, because of how this change is done, this fixes an issue where the root path was being output incorrectly by URL::to. URL::to('/') used to output ""link"" (without a trailing slash), but now outputs ""link/"" as it should for the root URL.",1
