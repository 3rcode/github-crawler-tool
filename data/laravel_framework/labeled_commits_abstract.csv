1397,"Slightly reword readme, link email (#21781)",0.7019664,Stop email re-verification with same link (#27070) ,Adding the stop_buffering config option. The FingersCrossedHandler Logger will first start buffering log records until a record exceeds the configured action_level. When the action_level is exceeded the buffered records will be flushed to the provided log location. By default the FingersCrossedHandler will stop buffering log records after its first flush (due to the $stopBuffering property). All records pushed to the log handler afterwards will be flushed directly to the log location. With this config update the log handler can be configured to resume the buffering after a flush occurs. This can be useful for applications that rely heavily on gather debug log records which only are useful when an error logging is passed. In the old setup all the debug records after an error record would be flushed to the log location. @see link Co-authored-by: Wim Ulkeman wulkeman@assuradeurengilde.nl,1

Because of changes made to error handling, the previously configured value is no longer sufficiently large. A similar change was also done in Symfony a while ago, see link. I used the following artisan command to determine the amount of memory required for error handling, using a reporter that simply writes to a file: ```php <?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\Console\Commands; use Illuminate\Console\Command; final class MeasureHandlerMemory extends Command {     protected $signature = 'measure-handler-memory'; private int $peak; public function handle(): void {     $this->peak = memory_get_peak_usage(); module } public function __destruct() {     $used = memory_get_peak_usage() - $this->peak;     echo ""error handling used: "" . $used . ""\n""; module } } ``` Free memory in HandleExceptions::handleShutdown() While validating the effectiveness of link in our application, I found that the call $error = error_get_last() causes a tiny bit of memory usage. Thus, I think it is better to clear memory as soon as entering the handler. Update HandleExceptions.php Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",0

This is because the handler from register_shutdown_function() attempts to instantiate a FatalError instance, thus trying to use memory that is not available.

Instead this property is only used by the migrator when wrapping DB::transaction() & DB::pretend(). The queries still run on the default database connection (or the command option --database.) This change makes queries run using that $connection while not affecting the migrations repository. i.e., the connection for the migrations history table.

However single/double quote characters in such array configs aren't supported.

The Fingerscrossed handler will buffer all log records that are at or above the provided level configuration. Only when a log record is provided at or above the action_level all the buffered records will be flushed to the log itself.

($undefined ?? true) (which is how @unless would compile it). This necessitated the creation of renderUnless(), because @includeUnless() accepts multiple arguments, and parsing out the first argument to a Blade directive is fraught.

3152,Apply fixes from StyleCI (#36508),0.6130613,Add some fixes ,"Summary This pull request adds a new way to define attribute ""accessors / mutators"" as they are currently called in the  documentation: link Currently, accessors and mutators are added to a model by defining get{Foo}Attribute and set{Foo}Attribute methods on the model. These conventionally named methods are then used when the developers attempts to access the $model->foo property on the model. This aspect of the framework has always felt a bit ""dated"" to me. To be honest, I think it's one of the least elegant parts of the framework that currently exists. First, it requires two methods. Second, the framework does not typically prefix methods that retrieve or set data on an object with get and set - it just hasn't been part of Laravel's style (e.g., $request->input() vs. $request->getInput(), $request->ip() vs. $request->getIp, etc. This pull request adds a way to define attribute access / mutation behavior in a single method marked by the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute return type. In combination with PHP 8+ ""named parameters"", this allows developers to define accessor and mutation behavior in a single method with fluent, modern syntax by returning an Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute instance: php /  * Get the user's title.  */ protected function title(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         get: fn ($value) => strtoupper($value),         set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),     ); } Accessors / Mutators & Casts As some might have noticed by reading the documentation already, Eloquent attribute ""casts"" serve a very similar purpose to attribute accessors and mutators. In fact, they essentially serve the same purpose; however, they have two primary benefits over attribute accessors and mutators. First, they are reusable across different attributes and across different models. A developer can assign the same cast to multiple attributes on the same model and even multiple attributes on different models. An attribute accessor / mutator is inherently tied to a single model and attribute. Secondly, as noted in the documentation, cast classes allow developers to hydrate a value object that aggregates multiple properties on the model (e.g. Address composed of address_line_one, address_line_two, etc.), immediately set a property on that value object, and then save the model like so: module The current, multi-method implementation of accessor / mutators currently does not allow this and it can not be added to that implementation minor breaking changes. However, this improved implementation of attribute accessing does support proper value object persistence in the same way as custom casts - by maintaining a local cache of value object instances: php /  * Get the user's address.  */ protected function address(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         get: fn ($value, $attributes) => new Address(             $attributes['address_line_one'],             $attributes['address_line_two'],             $attributes['city'],         ),         set: fn ($value) => [             'address_line_one' => $value->addressLineOne,             'address_line_two' => $value->addressLineTwo,             'city' => $value->city,         ],     ); } Mutation Comparison In addition, as you may have noticed, this implementation of accessors / mutators does not require you to manually set the properties in the $this->attributes array like a traditional mutator method requires you to. You can simply return the transform value or array of key / value pairs that should be set on the model: ""Old"", two-method approach: php public function setTitleAttribute($value) {     $this->attributes['title'] = strtolower($value); } New approach: php protected function title(): Attribute {     return new Attribute(         set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),     ); } FAQs What if I already have a method that has the same name as an attribute? Your application will not be broken because the method does not have the Attribute return type, which did not exist before this pull request. Will the old, multi-method approach of defining accessors / mutators go away? No. It will just be replaced in the documentation with this new approach.",0

This is a resubmit of #17087 & #36708, and fixes #22805. Credit to @dan-har for the initial solution and @mixlion for updating it for >=6.x. The original PR was meant to support POST requests where their Content-type was set to application/json (instead of the typical application/x-www-form-urlencoded), but it introduced a subtle and dangerous bug because while $request->getInputSource() does return the JSON data for JSON requests, it also returns the GET data for GET requests.

A HTTP response body can be: * status code: 200 HTTP OK * header: Content-Type: application/json * body: false Starting in v8.52.0, assertStatus() shows errors messages if any are found in a JSON response body. The TestResponse@json() method should be avoided since it applies additional key/value payload error checking unrelated to the HTTP status code. Instead silently detect JSON response body key 'errors' and only throw the ""Invalid JSON"" exception when Laravel's JSON assertion methods are called. Test assertStatus() on GZIP-encoded JSON Avoid exception ""Invalid JSON was returned from the route"" when the TestResponse class is unable to discover the JSON response body 'errors' key.

MySQL has supported using ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for DATETIME columns since v5.6.5.  Laravel currently previously only supported useCurrentOnUpdate for TIMESTAMP columns in MySQL. We set the fractional seconds precision to be consistent throughout the column initialization (for the column type, the default, and the on update).  MySQL requires that the precision be identical throughout.  Note that this implicitly fixed a (likely rare) bug when users tried to run something like ->dateTime('foo', 2)->useCurrent(). Previously this would result in MySQL error code 1067 for invalid default values.  It will not set the default to have the same precision as the column definition. The actual code was borrowed heavily from typeTimeStamp.  Since they are distinct column types, it felt incorrect to DRY it up despite their similarities. Relevant MySQL documentation: MySQL 5.6 MySQL 5.7 MySQL 8.0 Use single quotes instead of double quotes when possible",0

While the theory was sound, the implementation didn't take into account the behavior in databases in which multiple schemas exist. In multi-schema databases, the list of tables for which data should not be dumped was incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. This revised approach takes advantage of PostgreSQL's support for pattern-based object references when specifying the list of tables for which data should not be dumped, and eliminates the need to perform complex search_path parsing altogether. The attendant Pull Request documentation explains how this technique works in detail. Re-implement pg_restore fix that was reverted link was fixed in a previous commit, but appears to have been lost during subsequent edits in link . This commit restores the changes made in link . Fixes #36054 Fix PostgreSQL object reference pattern quoting While not required in a psql interactive terminal, this pattern requires outer double-quotes to function as intended when passed as a CLI argument. While simple in this specific instance, pattern quoting can grow complicated (depending on the pattern), but is well explained in the PostgreSQL manual: link",0

Example now: $morphable =  [                 ""App\AnotherModel"",                 Relation::getMorphedModel('alias')         ];         $dataset = MyModel::query()             ->whereHasMorph('morphable', $morphable)             ->with('morphable')             ->orderBy('id')             ->limit(50)             ->get()             ->groupBy('morphable_type'); With this change can be: $morphable =  [                 ""App\AnotherModel"",                 'alias',                 'another',                 ""App\YetAnotherModel"",         ];         $dataset = MyModel::query()             ->whereHasMorph('morphable', $morphable)             ->with('morphable')             ->orderBy('id')             ->limit(50)             ->get()             ->groupBy('morphable_type'); Update QueriesRelationships.php",0

The Linux strategy matrix will discover   issues in PHP 7.2 & 7.3. Don't install PHP extension 'pcntl'   that isn't available on Windows. Some extensions must be explicitly setup   on Windows. e.g., pdo_mysql, fileinfo, ftp php.ini 'memory_limit' must be increased   128M to 512M when running all PHPUnit tests   synchronously. Some GitHub Actions workflow configs   don't work in Windows because containers   only work on Linux: MySQL server Redis server. There are no native Windows     binaries for Redis so a clone like Memurai     would have to be manually setup. Memcached   The above absent services will cause some   tests to be skipped. Skip CI-only tests when running Windows   Server 2019 since mysqld.exe isn't available. Further increase testRetry*()'s margin of error   for assertEqualsWithDelta(). The call is meant   to be delayed 100ms but Github Actions' virtual   env returns up to 110.3ms. Bump league/flysystem 1.0.8 to 1.0.34 FilesystemAdapterTest::testPath() fails when run on Windows using 1.0.8. A Windows-only change added in 1.0.34 meets the behavior Laravel expects for file paths. Fix brittle FilesystemTest on Windows w/ PHP 7.2 The test cases re-using subdirectory DIR.'/tmp/foo' causes issues when running PHP 7.2 on Windows. The kernel's directory deletetion operating is async so the next PHPUnit test case is starting before directory deletion has completed for the previous test. create DIR.'/tmp' only once for    FilesystemTest by using PHPUnit @beforeClass    and @afterClass annotations. make each test use a unique subdirectory name    so there is no overlap / leakage between tests    when mkdir() is called.",0

It's for the exact same reason as outlined in link : This is motivated by the fact that in tests, when using the RefreshDatabase trait, transactions events are dispatched and may interfer with the application testing itself when it relies on events like these ( for further info, see link ). As to not have custom handling of transaction events interfere with the test suite itself, this simply disables this. Again, the same change was added to RefreshDatabase and is still present; this PR merely keeps the behaviour of them in sync in regards to the handling of events in transactions.",1

8121,Merge pull request #7817 from JosephSilber/conditional-tweak,0.5999939,Allow chaining of the Request::merge() calls (#22479),"This PR adds support for a new php artisan schema:dump command which uses mysqldump or pgdump to dump the current state of your schema to a database/schema/{connection}-schema.mysql file. When this file exists and php artisan migrate or php artisan migrate:fresh is run AND no migrations have run against the database yet (migrations table is empty), this schema file will be loaded into the database first and then any outstanding migrations will be run. This means that effectively this schema file would typically only ever be used during local development or during CI testing. In production, you would typically already have migrations that have run in the past so this schema file would never be triggered. Once the schema file is created, any or all of your existing migrations my be deleted as long as they have already run against your production environment. They are no longer needed during local development since the schema file exists. For convenience, a --prune flag has been added to the schema:dump command to delete your existing migrations after dumping the schema. This new feature solves two problems. First, it relieves developers from having a huge migrations directory full of files they no longer need. Second, loading a single schema file is quicker than running hundreds of migrations for each test class in your applications, so your tests can run much faster when using a schema.",0

Changing resolve method to make results in calling Illuminate\Foundation\Application::make method which loads deferred providers. Calling resolve method calls Illuminate\Container\Container::resolve which does not load deferred providers.,0

The primary use case for this functionality is to apply casts to columns resulting from subqueries or joins, that are not usually present on the model. While adding the aliases for those columns to the $casts array on the model does work, I feel that polluting the model with columns that are simply not present most of the time is not ideal, especially when the actual definition of those column names are likely to be spread across many different files. Consider the following query selecting Users along with the date of their most recent Post: php User     ::select([         'users.',         'last_posted_at' => Post::selectRaw('MAX(created_at)')             ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')     ])     ->get(); While User’s own timestamps will be cast to Carbon instances, last_posted_at will simply be a string. Currently, the only way to cast this would be to add last_posted_at to either $casts or $dates on User, despite the column only being present for this one specific query. This PR allows the following: php User     ::select([         'users.',         'last_posted_at' => Post::selectRaw('MAX(created_at)')             ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')     ])     ->withCasts(['last_posted_at' => 'date'])     ->get(); where the array of casts will be merged into any existing casts specified on the model. Naming wise I’m not sure if “withCasts” is the best option; I’ve just gone along with the likes of “withCount”.",0
9058,Remove array_get() null default value),0.616243,⚠️ Return an empty array from Arr::wrap() when called with null (#21745),"When inserting a float value into MySQL via the Illuminate\Database package when using at least PHP 7.3, the value is converted to an int. The bug has been reported a few times before: 30435 illuminate/database#246 PR #16069 introduced logic to the MySQLConnection that cast floats to ints to address a comparison problem with JSON columns, which was reported in issue #16063. This does not seem to cause a problem with PHP 7.1 and below but causes the float to lose it's decimal places when using PHP 7.3. I have not tested with PHP 7.2. Given we have the following MySQL table: CREATE TABLE module (   module varchar(255) NOT NULL,   module decimal(15,10) NOT NULL,   module decimal(15,10) NOT NULL ) When we execute the following using Artisan Tinker: module Then we should see both records with -0.2 as the latitude.

9122,allow trait to be moved,0.4812385,Allow users to specify options for migrate:fresh for DatabaseMigration trait (#39637),"This adds the ability to write your own custom casts. These can cast to simple primitive values like strings (like an encrypted string) or to objects. When casting to objects, you have the opportunity to sync the object's values back into the model before saving.  Objects that cast attributes must implement the Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes contract or CastsInboundAttributes. This CastsAttributes interface defines a get and set method.  For example, a JSON caster that replicates the built-in JSON casting offered by Laravel would look like the following: ```php <?php use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes; class JsonCaster implements CastsAttributes {     public function get($model, $key, $value, $attributes)     {         return json_decode($value, true);     } public function set($model, $key, $value, $attributes) {     return json_encode($value); } } modulephp <?php use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes; class AddressCaster implements CastsAttributes {     public function get($model, $key, $value, $attributes)     {         return new Address(             $attributes['address_line_one'],              $attributes['address_line_two']         );     } public function set($model, $key, $value, $attributes) {     return [         'address_line_one' => $value->lineOne,          'address_line_two' => $value->lineTwo     ]; } } ``` When defined this way, you may update the address object properties and then save the model. The object's properties will be synced back to the model before saving: php $user->address->lineOne = 'New Line 1'; $user->save();",0

This seems unwanted because if you're formatting the resource in a specific way through the toArray method you'd expect it to be honered when calling toJson I believe. toJson isn't documented on the Json Resources documentation but I still believe that this should be honered.

To fix this, we are first checking if the $ids is an  Arrayable and we convert the ids to an array before checking the results. Ensure find* methods on relationships are accepting Arrayable idsThe regression in #7048 and #19019 is also observed in #9143, because the find,  findMany and findOrFail methods are copied from the Eloquent Builder to the BelongsToMany and HasManyThrough relations.For this reason, we need to convert the passed ids to an array before executing the queries.",0

This is activated by a driver option in your queue configuration file. This gives us a scalable, serverless option for storing failed job information, and this information can also be accessed outside of Amazon VPCs using the Amazon SDK, allowing services like Laravel Vapor and others to potentially display user's failed job information without full access to their database. Since ""flushing"" a DynamoDb table is not exactly ""supported"", we will need to recommend users configure a TTL on the expires_at attribute which will take care of pruning off old jobs over time.",0

The fact that the default container we inject here is an instance of the Laravel application is an implementation detail. This PR contains no breaking changes other than renaming the $app property to $container. The new type-hint still allows for the current Application instance to be passed through but makes it clear that this could be any implementation of a container. I've also made $config a dedicated property on the Manager class as it's widely used on our own adapters. This makes it easy to reference it. The container array calls were replaced by make methods because ArrayAccess isn't part of the Container contract (and it shouldn't be).,0

But you can opt to include different ones or multiple ones: 'email' => 'email:rfc,dns' Or opt for the pre-5.8 behavior: 'email' => 'email:filter' Which will use filter_var to validate the email address.

10299,Fix root URI not showing (#31771),0.6833341,allow to reset forced scheme and root-url in UrlGenerator (#34039),These changes remove all hardcoded valdation from the PasswordBroker. The reason for this is because this is a hardcoded constraint in validation and thus limits people from building password reset forms with their specific flow. The validation is already done within the ResetsPassword trait and is only duplicated in the Broker. The Broker also seems like the wrong place to do this as it only facilitates the retrieval of the user and the token validation (which is still the correct place for these two). This also allows us to remove the link language line. See link,0

At the moment this is duplicated in the ResetsPasswords trait where it can be customized by overwriting the rules method and the PasswordBroker where it cannot be adjusted. A length of 8 is a sensible default to have (see link) but allowing people to overwrite when needed allows people to modify as they see fit. I've left the rules in user land (laravel/laravel repo & ResetsPassword trait) as is because it still makes sense to ship with a default length in user land.,0

It basically doesn't breaks much. The get call lookup will now first look at the JSON files to find a translation. If it doesn't finds it, it applies the previous get behavior and performs a lookup in the PHP translation files.

10782,Merge pull request #27710 from driesvints/fix-notification-sender,0.63584393,Allow chaining of the Request::merge() calls (#22479),"This is currently broken and will throw a SQL exception: DB::table('posts')->paginate(5, ['title', 'content']); At the moment when you attempt to pass specific columns on the paginate method on the base query builder it will fail when you provide more than one column. SQL queries can only handle a count for a specific column and not multiple ones. That's why it's unwanted to pass along the columns parameter from the paginate method to the getCountForPagination method. Since we just want to do a count of the current result set a simple count with the '*' sign is enough. At the moment the Eloquent builder already handles pagination in this way. It's noted by Staudenmeier that the only difference is when you provide a specific column to the getCountForPagination method is that it'll only count non-NULLs. However, it's not feasible to allow this to be done in combination with the paginate method because the columns param on the paginate method soley exists to filter which columns will be retrieved in the paginated result set (which is currently broken thus). See link I've added an extra integration test which reproduces the problem at hand. I've updated the tests in the DatabaseQueryBuilderTest class to reflect the changes made to getCountForPagination call. This has been a long outstanding issue so hopefully this will prevent more issues from popping up. Fixes link",0

So there are 2 types of guards. which I think a contract (interface) is missing here, in order to mark the SessionGuard class or any other custom guard as an event dispatching guard, and enforce setDispatcher and getDispatcher methods on them.) So the clunky method_exists check won't be needed. Re-submit: link fixed: link",0

Before that PR, the arguments were spread out before being passed to the callbacks, so the user and the ability were merged with the other arguments, before being passed to the callback. Since then, the arguments are being passed as an array, so instead of merging the user and the ability with the array of arguments, which is superfluous, we can directly pass the user, the ability, and the arguments directly to the callback. This commit doesn't change the existing functionality, and it keeps backwards compatibility. I have also added some assertions to the tests, since the arguments in the before callbacks were never tested.",0

This change takes what is given in the ""expression"" and passes it through unaltered to compile to PHP.  This gives the user full control over what ends up in the compiled output, and does not limit what they can put in the first argument. This does, however, remove the default encoding options if a user fails to pass a second argument through. This is an undocumented feature. Tests are updated to reflect the change, and new tests are added to make sure the ""value"" argument can contain commas and functions.",0

When the placeholders are replaced in the validation messages, the :date parameter is normally replaced if it references another attribute, e.g. after:start_date but not when it's a relative keyword. This is an issue when the locale is other than english: e.g. the date_equals:tomorrow in french is translated to Le champ date doit être une date égale à tomorrow. This commit allows for developers to specify custom translation for these values. E.g. in fr/validation.php: php 'values' => [     'date' => [         'tomorrow' => 'demain',     ], ], So now the validation message will be translated to Le champ date doit être une date égale à demain.",0

The reason behind this is because the TTL can be more than seconds. It can be an instance of DateTimeInterface and DateInterval as well. Overall it also makes the internals a bit clearer so a call like this: $seconds = $this->getSeconds($seconds); Becomes the following which makes more sense: $seconds = $this->getSeconds($ttl); No changes were made to the cache stores themselves because these always accept integers/seconds so it's more appropriate to leave these as is.,0

12373,Apply fixes from StyleCI (#21129),0.61560065,Add some fixes ,"These changes to the Cache Repository interface and implementation will make our cache implementation compliant with the PSR-16 standard's TTL requirements. It contains some significant changes in how we handle and store cache values. The main change that was done is that now a TTL with a value of NULL will be considerd an attempt to store the item forever. In addition to this, any value with a TTL equal or lower than zero will be considerd an attempt to remove the item from the cache. The put, putMany and add methods were updated to reflect these changes. Before these changes a request like Cache::put('foo', 'bar') wouldn't do anything since a NULL TTL meant that the call was simply ignored. Now any request without a specified TTL will have the default TTL of NULL and thus the request is considered to attempting to store the item forever. For the putMany call a NULL TTL now means that every single item will be stored forever individually. As there isn't a putManyForever equivalent on the Repository or the PSR interface, there was no way to tell a cache store to store the given items in one go. For the add call, the behavior to ignore the call when a zero or less TTL was given is kept but when a NULL TTL is now passed, it's correctly passed to the cache store. This will ignore a custom add method on the cache store as any NULL TTL simply could be considered to re-store the item indefinitely. No changes were made to the cache stores themselves. Only the Repository was modified. This way, the cache stores keep their current behavior as theyaren't implementations of the PSR Simple Cache interface. All in all these changes will now make us conform with the PSR specs much better.",0

Fix validation bypass for rules 'before' and 'after' when paired with 'date_format'. Now when when there is both a 'date_format' rule and a 'before' and/or 'after' rule, the first parameter will be converted to a timestamp, and only if that fails, it will be considered as a name for another field.

Allows customization of logging channel post-creation. Continued support for functionality provided by configureMonologUsing maintained using custom driver type with factory invokable that returns any PSR3 compatible logger. This allows full customization of entire logging channel.

This was raised in the Adldap2-Laravel repo:  link This PR solves the issue by explicitly checking for the --no-interaction flag (but not the shorthand -n flag) to set the interactive mode of the new input in the same manner symfony/application sets it in Application::configureIO:  link An alternative would be to check if the current command is being run in non-interactive mode, but I think that would have a higher chance of breaking existing code. This way, the only way to break existing code is if someone is using the --no-interaction argument in a command call and somehow still expecting interaction. Avoiding BC breaks is also the reason I've omitted the -n short syntax, as it is plausible that people may have developed commands that are being called exclusively by other commands and have their own meaning for -n without knowing it's intended purpose.",1

18847,[5.6] Use the session() method of TestResponse (#23974),0.74816525,Improved session errors assertions in TestResponse::assertSessionHasErrors() (#23055),"Can't Wrap DB Names Containing Spaces When Aliasing Database names containing spaces are perfectly legal in Microsoft SQL Server. Currently, when using SQL Server, if you have a database which includes spaces, the grammar handles wrapping it fine. So this: My Sample Database.dbo.my_table.my_column Correctly becomes: [My Sample Database].[dbo].[my_table].[my_column] But if you also try to alias a column when the database contains spaces, it breaks. This: My Sample Database.dbo.my_table.my_column AS my_aliased_column Becomes: [My] AS [Sample] I have traced the error to Database/Grammar/wrapAliasedValue() using explode( ' ' ) - the code thinks the spaces in the database name are the spaces around the ""AS"". We can fix this by using regex instead of explode, splitting on the ""AS"" more accurately. Just replace the explode with this: $segments = preg_split( '/\s+as\s+/i', $value ); Note: When you have an Eloquent belongsToMany method that has to include the database name (eg. we need to join across DBs), this type of alias is created automatically, generating this error.

The make() method no longer accepts a second argument of parameters - needing this feature indicates a code smell and you can always construct the object in another way. It simply complicated the container and code and made it hard to read. Secondly, the share() method has been removed. This method was an old method to provide backwards compatibility with Pimple. It has not been documented in a few years and the more popular “singleton()” method is easier to use. Thirdly, the Normalize() method has been removed. This is the most called method in all of Laravel and it is called almost 1,000 times on every request because of the heavy usage of the container. On a fresh opcache enabled run of Laravel it is actually uses about 8-9% of the entire request processing time. It’s whole purpose is to allow you to bind objects into the container with a leading slash; however, Foo::class never returns a leading slash and if you pass a string we can simply document that a leading slash should not be provided.",0

This creates behavior like the following: module This is probably a confusing error for those hitting it when using 127.0.0.1. We can make sure we bind to ipv4 by either binding to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1.  Binding to 127.0.0.1 is safer of course, and doesn't really change expected behavior (since ipv6 is not prevalent still and we're just talking localhost networks here). This change would behave like this: module Other OS considerations: Windows: localhost often checks ipv6 first and then goes to ipv4 if nothings listening on v6. This creates considerable lag, so using 127.0.0.1 may work better on Windows as well Linux: I don't believe this is default behavior on even newer versions of Linux, but since we're talking about localhost networks in any case, I don't see any reason not to assume ipv4 over ipv6 would be the expected localhost network to use",1

If you are submitting a form that has input file fields and don't attach any file on those inputs it will send those as normal inputs with a value of null causing a validation exception if any of those fields have a validation rule of any kind (except required). This happens because on how validation of null fields are handled now in 5.3. If you don't expect those fields to be nullable, you'll have to add the 'nullable' validation rule to make your test pass. I think there is no use in sending empty file fields as normal inputs with a value of null. This filter prevents sending empty input file fields as normal inputs with a null value.

Because in Larvel's combined input system, the body items take precedence over query string items. If an item appears in the body that uses the same key as the one being used for the API token, then this body item is then assumed to be the token which could lead to authentication errors especially if the key is being set to a more generic custom name with a high risk of conflict, e.g. 'password'.

In the case of an invalid token it would be preferable to ask the user to login again and receive a new token rather than assume they are a guest. By making the getTokenForRequest method public that is now possible.,0
20855,Allow for array of expressions on where. Closes #991,0.660823,Make assertPath() accepts Closure (#41409),"This is a PR for Issue #13455 to bring consistency to model bind not found and findOrFail. The NotFoundHttpException was changed to a ModelNotFoundException and has the model set, the exact same as in Eloquent/Builder findOrFail. Although the Exceptions/Handler.php converts this back to a NotFoundHttpException in the prepareException method anyway (so thus should have same behaviour for projects using the default handling), by throwing a ModelNotFoundException in the first instance has the added benefit that a custom Handler subclass can render both cases of a model binding not found and a findOrFail in the same way. Furthermore, by having an exception that has the model name set on it, exception handling can be even more improved for binding failures, e.g. by default there is now the message ""No query results for model [App\ModeClass]."" instead of no message. This message is exactly the same as the exception from findOrFail since it is created inside the ModelNotFoundException itself. Before this fix, developers had to workaround this issue by providing a closure to return the correct exception on all their route models via a closure, although in the example given in this forum post, the developer didn't set the model on the exception: link",0

PHP 7 has fixed a bug with __isset which affects both the native isset and empty methods. This causes specific issues with checking isset or empty on relations in Eloquent. In PHP 7 checking if a property exists on an unloaded relation, for example isset($this->relation->id) is always returning false because unlike PHP 5.6, PHP 7 is now checking the offset of each attribute before chaining to the next one. In PHP 5.6 it would eager load the relation without checking the offset. This change brings back the intended behavior of the core Eloquent model __isset method for PHP 7 so it works like it did in PHP 5.6.

For any comments over 1024 characters (not uncommon when commenting out a chunk of markup), PHP 7 would fail to match the regex due to hitting a JIT stack limit. Adding the s modifier tells the regex engine to include newline characters when matching the dot character and allows us to remove the inner capture group. This drastically reduces the amount of memory the regex uses and keeps it well within the JIT stack limit for typical uses. This increases the limit for comment length up to approximately 1 million characters, instead 1024.",0

It's being raised because we noticed that a scheduled task wasn't being run. It was only after we added before and after functions for logging that it started to work. When digging into it we see that it's run in a different way when before or after functions are present. For consistency, could all scheduled tasks be run using the open_proc method rather than exec? Alternatively, should an explicit ""runInBackground"" flag be made available?",0

It looks like on line 11 it uses use CreatesUserProviders then on line 73 it creates a new PasswordBroker. This issue arrises because PasswordBrokerManager is using a trait and referring to an array on the trait that is instantiated on AuthManager. Since it is a trait it is creating a brand new empty array on PasswordBrokerManager which causes issues.

This leads to issues when type hinting on the Gate interface as methods are not defined in the type hinted type object: public function update(GateContract $gate) {     $gate->allows('post-user'); } This either limits the implementation being used to the provided one or forces the use of the check method when type hinting the interface which is often less clear than the explicit allows / denies methods.

When an instance of Pivot is created and date attributes such as created_at and updated_at at passed it tried to convert those to a Carbon instance using the connection’s sql grammar from the parent. As the time the pivot is being filled, no table neither connection is already set by the parent model, so the pivot resolves a grammar from the default connection. The fix consist on moving $this->setTable($table); and $this->setConnection($parent->getConnectionName()); before $this->forceFill($attributes); on the Pivot’s class constructor. I tried to change the testPropertiesAreSetCorrectly test in DatabaseEloquentPivotTest.php to reproduce the use case, as the current test does not test that. But got an error from PHP Unit pointing to this method in the Model class: /*  * Get the format for database stored dates.  *  * @return string  / protected function getDateFormat() {     return $this->dateFormat ?: $this->getConnection()->getQueryGrammar()->getDateFormat(); } I think this is related to the mocking instance, but my testing knowledge is not enough to fix it.
