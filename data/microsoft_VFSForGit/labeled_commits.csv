2,Merge pull request #1593 from microsoft/features/mac-endpoint-security-prototype,0.45665178,Pull Requests,"UtcNow spends a lot of time getting a very precise system time, including leap seconds and interpolation through QueryPerformanceCounter. Use Environment.TickCount (milliseconds since boot) instead, since that just retrieves a value in shared memory that the kernel keeps up to date. This value is still suitable for controlling how much log output index parsing produces. This UtcNow call consumes 15% of the time under GitIndexParser.ParseIndex.

We don't anticipate changing it any time soon. Thus, we can drop the requirement of an exact Git version match. This PR changes the current logic in a few ways:  Take the full GitVersion parsing logic from microsoft/scalar, as it is more robust. Remove the exact version match with a minimum version match. Use a fixed constant version string instead of a build-time string. Require that the Revision of the version string is an exact match. We will use this to signal that a microsoft/git version introduces a breaking change that requires a VFS for Git upgrade.  What is a Revision item? In a Git version string such as v2.X.Y.vfs.Z.W, the Revision is represented by Z. This allows us to modify the other version items arbitrarily, including taking version numbers 2.X.Y from upstream and updating .W if we have any hotfixes to microsoft/git.",0

136,Update Git to remove ODB string check,0.9031174,1717 [HOTFIX] Update Git to remove ODB string check,"The loose object download needs to verify the objects being sent across the wire before moving them to their ""real"" locations in the object directory. The previous implementation wrote them to disk then read from that file to hash the contents. Instead, create a new ""SideChannelStream"" that injects between the responseStream and the inflater, but sends all of the data that is read out to the filestream. Here is a diagram of the stream sequence: responseStream -> sideChannelStream -> inflateStream -> hashingStream                            \                                   |                 \                                 \|/                  tempFileStream                devNull By copying all data from the hashingStream into devNull, we ensure that the responseStream is drained and written to the tempFileStream while simultaneously inflating and hashing the object contents.

It's completely unacceptable to exit here, as it kills the service and then it restarts. Better to have no upgrades than to let this continue. The cause of this exception was a missing executable when checking ProjFS.IsGVFSUpgradeSupported(), which seems to call PowerShell.

175,Merge pull request #764: Log ring when querying for upgrades on the background timer,0.49744946,- Disable commit-graph verify for performance concerns,"This replaces #1648. BuildXL was having issues detecting that a folder had changes when the projection changed because VFSForGit was simply updating its in memory projection and not doing anything with the file system that would trigger and update to the USN. It would hand back the new items in the directory when ProjFS would ask for the items for enumeration the next time an enumeration happened. This change is to make the folder get a new USN when VFSForGit determines that a folder has changed.  This is done by keeping a SHA1 hash of all the names of the folder entries that are in the projection. When the projection changes, calculate the new SHA for the folder and compare with what it had before.  If it changed, then write and delete a file in the folder to trigger the USN update. Note: We don't need any upgrade step because we are already storing the SHA for the folder in the placeholder database but it is currently null for all folders so the first time there is a projection change it will cause all the folders to get the calculated SHA for the folder and update the placeholder database.  Tasks:  [X] Update folder SHA-1 calculation to depend only on child names, not contents. [x] Get installer to BuildXL folks for validation. [x] Place this behavior behind a config option. [ ] Document the config option. (Delaying to #1665) [ ] Update functional test to run in CI and PR validation (behind config).

The way we ""force"" Git to repack all is to provide a custom batch size. This batch size used to mean ""repack all pack-files with size at most X until reaching a size of at least X"". By specifying ""total size - 1"", this required repacking all objects. HOWEVER, the new logic actually computes an ""expected"" size of the objects in a pack that are referenced by the multi-pack-index. If we have duplicate objects, then those objects can cause two types of error: The duplicates reduce the total expected size below the batch size. The computation of ""total expected size"" causes round-off error. Both types of error under-count the number of bytes in the final pack-file. By changing the batch size to ""total size - min size + 1"" we ensure the following: I. The batch size is larger than the maximum pack size. II. Every pack-file is required to reach the batch size. III. We have minimized the chance that duplicate objects will drop below this threshold.

The way we ""force"" Git to repack all is to provide a custom batch size. This batch size used to mean ""repack all pack-files with size at most X until reaching a size of at least X"". By specifying ""total size - 1"", this required repacking all objects. HOWEVER, the new logic actually computes an ""expected"" size of the objects in a pack that are referenced by the multi-pack-index. If we have duplicate objects, then those objects can cause two types of error: The duplicates reduce the total expected size below the batch size. The computation of ""total expected size"" causes round-off error. Both types of error under-count the number of bytes in the final pack-file. By changing the batch size to ""total size - min size + 1"" we ensure the following: I. The batch size is larger than the maximum pack size. II. Every pack-file is required to reach the batch size. III. We have minimized the chance that duplicate objects will drop below this threshold. With the use of gvfs-helper, we have less control over the pack-files that are downloaded as part of the clone operation. At minimum, with this change we should be in a better state than before.

486,Correct logging when setting feedpackagename,0.4514295,Adds additional logging for folder and file placeholder creation.,"VFSForGit installer fails in postinstall script while trying to launch Service and UserNotification agents in GUI context of logged in users. To determine users logged into the GUI context, postinstall script looks for loginwindow commands and the user running the command. When Fast User switching is enabled, then loginwindow can be running as root user, even though root user is Not logged in. In such cases, postinstall tries to launch Service and UserNotifcation agents in GUI context of root user (that does not exist) resulting in failure. This commit makes postinstall look for Finder command (which only runs after a user has successfully logged into GUI context and is therefore more reliably associated with GUI session) rather than loginwindow. Also Updated launchd plist for Service and Notification agents, added LimitLoadToSessionType = Aqua, just to make sure the agents get launched into the GUI context only. Fixes #1444",0

The remaining operations to block are:  A process attempts to read/execute an empty file in an offline root. The result of the read would be bad data, so failing with denied authorisation is preferable to letting the bad data propagate. A process attempts to create files or directories in an offline root.  The commits implementing those 2 changes are fairly straightforward, however they did cause some knock-on effects:  During gvfs clone, the git subprocess itself wants to create files/directories in the offline root, so we need it to inherit the parent gvfs process's entitlement to access offline roots. The exception check therefore now walks up the process hierarchy. One of the functional tests, CheckoutBranchWithOpenHandleBlockingProjectionDeleteAndRepoMetdataUpdate needs to mess with the repo while it's not mounted, so I've registered the test runner for offline I/O for the duration of that test. To avoid weird edge cases, I've made the offline I/O registration in the native userlib thread-safe and reference counted, so registering multiple times is fine, and we only actually deregister once it's been matched with an equal number of unregister calls.",0

551,Merge pull request #1027 from github/posix-hooks-refactor,0.48910666,Pull Requests,"add MoveIndexFileFails() functional test On some platforms (notably Linux), we receive only a pre-rename permission request rather than a pre-delete permission request during a rename(2) operation, so the virtualization instance's OnPreRename() handler becomes responsible for ensuring that, outside of a GVFS lock, the .git/index file can not be renamed or overwritten. The BasicFileSystemTests.DeleteIndexFileFails() test handles the case of a true delete of .git/index, as well as platforms which deliver a pre-delete event on the source path prior to a rename action. As well, several GVFSLockTests tests such as the LockPreventsRenameFromInsideWorkingTreeOnTopOfIndex() test the case of a file being renamed to .git/index, but no existing test checks for the case of .git/index being renamed to another path (although DeleteIndexFileFails() likely suffices on platforms which send a pre-delete event). Therefore we add an explicit MoveIndexFileFails() functional test to cover this case.  Note that we use System.IO.File.Replace() in the SystemIORunner because File.Move() is implemented on Unix/POSIX systems such that it actually performs a copy or hard link first, then a delete, not a true rename(2).  The effect on a platform where pre-rename but not pre-delete events are delivered on rename operations is that the link succeeds, then the delete fails (since that does send a pre-delete permission request, which is denied as the path is .git/index), leaving behind a spurious extra file link.  So we want to trigger a true rename(2), which is what File.Replace() does.",0

I/O needs to be blocked when:  A message failed to deliver to the provider. A process attempts to write to an empty file in an offline root (this file would subsequently be overwritten by a hydration event) A process attempts to write to a placeholder (hydrated unmodified) file when the provider is offline. The file would not show up in git status and could be overwritten by a subsequent checkout/rebase/merge. A process attempts to rename a file in an offline root. A process attempts to read/execute an empty file in an offline root. The result of the read would be bad data, so failing with denied authorisation is preferable to letting the bad data propagate. A process attempts to create files or directories in an offline root.  This change implements cases 1-4. Cases 5-6 will be covered in a future change. At first glance this seems like it would be a very simple change, but in practice, some processes must be allowed unfettered access to files in offline roots. So a large part of this patch set is dedicated to implementing a system for allowing exceptions - there is a new type of IOKit user client for processes which need unrestricted access to offline roots, and this needed to be implemented all the way through from kext, via native lib, to (managed) VFS4G code proper. Next, the vnode handler, which is in the actual business of denying or allowing file access, has been expanded to allow returning different results based on whether the root's provider is offline. Finally, ""deny"" results are actually returned for a number of different cases - so far, this only includes writes. Even this caused some test failures, so the test process itself needs to register as an exception with unrestricted offline root access.",0

621,Got rid of unnecessary under construction check,0.4586411,fixes a performance regression in the background maintenance jobs. ," Extend GitRepoTests to allow include mode  The GitRepoTests can be initialized with a ValidateWorkingTree mode that is currently a boolean. If enabled, we will add extra checks to make sure the working tree of our virtual enlistment matches the enlistment from a vanilla Git repo. To extend this to the ""include"" mode, we need to first modify this boolean into an enum and add it as an extra option. Second, we need to be very careful about what we are comparing. We will no longer virtualize outside of the included folders. Be careful to include files in the root directory. The functional tests can then be run with ""--partial-mode"" to exercise only this option, which will isolate the test failures to this setting AND keep the test suite from getting too slow. Currently, the partial mode space is probably wider than necessary and can be reduced in later iterations. This does provide some coverage.

At least, most of the time. Uses the new feature in microsoft/git#156. By only writing the new data to a small ""tip"" commit-graph file, we can write much less data and only verify the new tip file. Current settings include --size-multiple=4: This guarantees each level of the chain is half the size of the level below. This means the chain length will be limited by log_4(N) where N is the number of commits. This means ~6 levels is the maximum theoretical chain length with 4,000,000 commits.

It has two command line arguments, -n which specifies the number of child directories to be displayed, and -d which specifies a target directory to run the health verb in. The default for -n is 5, and then default for -d is the current working directory. It also inherits a third command line argument from GVFSVerb.ForExistingEnlistment which is an optional path to the enlistment to run the command against in the case of being outside of it. The HealthVerb is what is run from the command line, and interacts with the enlistment to get the path data needed to compute the health of the enlistment. It uses the SQLite database to get placeholder data, the named pipe to get modified paths data, and the git index to get overall enlistment data. It packages this information into a GVFSEnlistmentPathData object which is passed to the GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator. The GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator takes in a GVFSEnlistmentPathData object and then analyzes it by building a local cone of the git tree and using that cone to compute health data (hydration) for the current directory as well as minimal information about the health of its child directories (to help when searching for the root cause of a problem). It then returns a GVFSEnlistmentHealthData object containing all of the corresponding data. The GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator is unit tested by the GVFSEnlistmentHealthTests unit test file.

752,Mac kext: Replaces use of OSAtomic with standard C11 atomic operation,0.4651409,1744: Overhaul build and project systems and drop Mac/POSIX code,"Today, we noticed a performance regression from 1.0.19074.2 to 1.0.19130.1 (M150). In that release, we changed the way we allocate and refresh LibGit2Repo objects. In order to allow packfile deletions, we need to drop the handles that LibGit2 keeps open during the duration of the LibGit2Repo. The change was to share one repo object and to dispose of it after 15 minutes of inactivity. However, that doesn't take into account the startup time required to initialize the data. This can be a lot worse if the user has thousands of pack-files. To fix this, change the model. With this change, the PackfileMaintenanceStep will request that the LibGit2Repos are closed before performing the expire command, and then will reinitialize the LibGit2 repo right after. This will keep the ""warmup"" time as part of the initial mount or as the background operation. If the read-object hook or a file hydration comes in while the expire command is running, a LibGit2 repo will be initialized and it may cause some .idx files to stick around until the next run. This was already the case, but then the warmup would happen during those operations. This will happen at most once a day.   How did you find this was the issue?   @jrbriggs gets all the credit for realizing that the performance difference between versions only happened in calls where one used the read-object hook. If the read-object hook wasn't called, then there was no difference in the performance numbers. But there was a significant slowdown if the read-object hook was called, and could even be several seconds for a single object. From that, I started spelunking the diff and looked specifically at what changed around the logic in InProcessMount for downloading an object. There were two candidates: i. The interaction with the Git credential manager had a lot of changes. I checked with @jamill about his expectations of performance numbers there, even if it is misbehaving. He and @jeschu1 thought there was no reason for more than 100ms of delay in any of that code, and other side-effects would be very visible if it required more server connections. This led me to focus hard on item (ii). ii. The LibGit2RepoInvoker was updated in this release to no longer create a large pool of repos at mount time and only dispose of them at process end. We had shipped this independently of the packfile maintenance for this very reason of being safe, but I had anticipated any problems would be in the multi-threaded access of a single libgit2 repo. The multi-threaded access has not been a problem, as far as I can tell.   How did you test the performance of this change?   To measure this, I made a change like in this commit to use a Stopwatch around the two operations. This would easily point to which of the two options above were likely the cause. After installing that version locally and running git grep foo to trigger loose object downloads, I saw the timing for the first read-object hook had 2.5 seconds in the TryGetIsBlob() method, and all subsequent calls were ~2 milliseconds. This was on my local repo where I had inflated the pack dir to ~800 packs. If a user has 7,000+ then libgit2 will take even longer to prep the packfile data structures. This performance testing also led me to double-check this PR and notice that the first run was still slow. The trick was to add the commit ""LibGit2RepoInvoker: Test a real SHA1 when initializing"" because using an empty SHA-1 seems to short-cut somewhere in the logic and not actually load the object store data in the LibGit2Repo. With that change, I see all of my TryGetIsBlob() calls taking 1-2 milliseconds again, even the first one after a PackfileMaintenanceStep. Resolves #1277",0

The main reason for this is so that the upgrade application can update the original application without open file handles getting in the way (and preventing the deletion of the application that is being updated). The upgrade verb currently has a hard coded list of dependencies (files) required for the upgrader application to run. This can be fragile as we need to keep this list in sync with the actual dependencies, across multiple platforms. This can easily break if the dependencies change, and we update the list of files included with the installer, but not with the upgrader application. A specific occurrence of this happened in #1144. Instead, just copy over the whole VFS for Git application directory when creating a temporary copy of the upgrader application to run.

When we take Git 2.22.0, this test starts to fail. The fix is to delete the multi-pack-index before rebuilding the .idx. This is a reasonable expectation because we won't have a pack covered by the multi-pack-index without having the corresponding .idx file. The reason this broke with Git 2.22.0 is a bit subtle: When running git index-pack, Git looks for duplicate objects in order to check for SHA-1 collisions. When the multi-pack-index includes the objects in the pack, Git sees what it thinks are the same object ids and goes to load the content to verify they are equal. In Git 2.22.0, we solved the ""many packs"" problem by adding the pack-files from the multi-pack-index to the packed_git linked list. Adding to this list will fail if there is no corresponding .idx file. (The multi-pack-index prevents any reads into this .idx file, but existence is required.) This means that the content lookup fails and Git complains with ""fatal: cannot read existing object info"" This will unblock taking Git 2.22.0 after the release.

844,Update tests to match new messages,0.4449458,- Disable commit-graph verify for performance concerns,"Two HandleVnodeOperationTests used ProviderMessageMock_SetCleanupRootsAfterRequest() to force removal of the (mock) provider. This caused the mock version of ProviderMessaging_TrySendRequestAndWaitForResponse() to call VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup(). This was problematic for 2 reasons:  VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup() does not just disconnect the provider, it wipes the entire root array, making any handles invalid. This never actually happens in the real kext. Any such sledgehammer approach has actually been prevented by assertions in the kext code. Now that those kick in during unit testing, this made the tests in question fail in multiple ways.  The fix is therefore to replace the call to VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup() with the more appropriate ActiveProvider_Disconnect(). Rather than special-casing this, ProviderMessageMock_SetCleanupRootsAfterRequest() has been replaced with ProviderMessageMock_SetRequestSideEffect() which allows setting a lambda expression to run in the mock version of ProviderMessaging_TrySendRequestAndWaitForResponse(). In the tests in question, it is the lambda that calls ActiveProvider_Disconnect().",0

This change:  Enables assertions in the testable kext build. Implements the back-end Assert() and panic() functions used by the assert() and assertf() macros, respectively. These back-end functions call into XCTest's test failure reporting mechanism, so failed kext assertions in unit tests are now reported as regular unit test failures. To facilitate this, the current test case needs to be known outside the test's Objective-C class, so we track that in thread-local storage by subclassing XCTestCase and deriving all tests from the new class, and perform current test registration/deregistration during setUp/tearDown. Some unit tests deliberately cause failed assertions, so a mechanism for ignoring a specific number of them in a test is provided. Not having full coverage in panic/Assert/etc. is a good thing, so those have been added to the 100% test coverage exceptions",0

Updating the installer to load kext would help in scenario. Also updated postflight script to log output of kextstat command that is used to determine if macOS autoloaded kext or not.

This causes us to delete or add an object during the LooseObjectsStep and have off-by-one errors. Instead of seeing 160 objects (for example) we see 159 or 161.

To   resolve this issue, make sure the same settings are used for restore and for   subsequent operations such as build or publish. Typically this issue can occur   if the RuntimeIdentifier property is set during build or publish but not during   restore. For more information, see   https://aka.ms/dotnet-runtime-patch-selection. My understanding is that this can happen when the runtime used by the restore operation does not match the runtime expected by the publish operation. As the publish operation might not call restore itself, it will generate this error when the runtime does not match the expected version. To fix this, the projects that generate self-contained applications will also set the TargetLatestRuntimePatch property to target the latest runtime.",0

Create a functional test that verifies this behavior. Move the LooseObjectStepTests to have a new enlistment for each test, since we are messing with the object store. Part of the issue is that .NET doesn't allow us to move files that are marked as read-only, which becomes problematic as tests create pack-indexes and other files.   Resolves #1079",0

However, with GCM 1.18.5, this does not result in the credentials being rejected.

A credential acquired via credential fill from Windows GCM for a dev.azure.com URL cannot successfully be rejected when including the username / password. To make this work, only reject credentials by URL.

The failing test sets the upgrade ring to ""None"". Then creates dummy upgrade marker file (C:\ProgramData\GVFS\GVFS.Upgrade\highestAvailableVersion). Then launches upgrade verb. Since the upgrade ring is None, the test expects upgrade verb to delete the marker file. This used to work. But now, upgrade verb will use Nuget upgrader when Nuget config is availble.

In many cases, this only mattered once a virtualisation root's vnode had been recycled, but if the first event for a root was for a file in that root, and not the root itself, the root's entry in the array could become corrupted with the vnode on the next event for the original event's file.

1493,Disable Native_ProjFS_MoveFile_PartialToOutside functional test,0.6821854,1697: Fix functional tests to skip around ProjFS issue,"Following child processes (-f) in dtruss has not worked reliably on Mac, at least not in recent OS versions. There are a few reasons for this:  Thread recycling behaviour means the self->child variable doesn't get wiped when a thread exits or a process dies, so random other processes end up with threads which suddenly start being traced. dtruss assumed new processes were always started with fork/execve or vfork/execve, entirely ignoring posix_spawn, which is much more common on macOS. The logging of newly detected threads in child processes was odd, implying each of them was caused by a fork() which of course is not the case. If traced parent processes died, newly created threads in child processes may fail to be traced.  This change fixes all of the above. The key changes:  The self->child thread-local variable identifying threads as being part of processes which are descendents of processes which match the original criteria now stores the PID, not simply a boolean. This lets us detect the case where threads are recycled. The self->start variable suffers from the same problem, causing the first syscall of a recycled thread to be traced, even if self->child has been cleaned up. There is special support for tracing through the various stages of posix_spawn in order to mark the newly spawned child process. The default buffer size for dynamic DTrace variables is hugely increased, as the script in its current state seems to consume a lot of memory.",0

It seems that some processes (clang?) will call close() on thousands of file descriptors that don't exist, which totally floods the trace.

The function has 6 arguments, so this change causes all of them to be saved until return and printed. The second argument (arg1) is the string of the executable file's path; this needs to be copied from usermem on syscall entry as copyinstr sometimes seems to fail in the return probe. The first argument (arg0) is a pointer to a memory location to which the created process's PID will be written, so we need to read the PID from usermem in order to print it.",0
1501,use RepoBackingRoot as needed in functional tests,0.5447186,1652: RepoRegistry: ignore non-existent repos,"dtruss was written for Solaris and last updated for an ancient version of macOS. (then Mac OS X) Somewhere along the way, tracing for execve() got broken - the printed PID was wrong, and printing the executable's path did not work. The reason for the former is unclear, in the return probe the pid simply evaluates to 0. That just seems to be a kernel quirk. By saving the correct value in a thread-local variable on syscall entry, we can print that on return. The executable path can't be printed as the string resides in user space memory, and after execve() returns, the whole userspace process has been replaced. So again the solution is to save the syscall argument on :entry for :return to print it.",0
1502,[macOS] Capture installer log on upgrade failure,0.6827276,Initial Mac upgrade functionality,"The existing dtruss script suffered the significant flaw that commands/processes launched via the dtruss command line could only be run as root as dtruss itself could only be run as root. This change allows the dtruss script itself to be run as non-root when passing a command by explicitly invoking dtrace using sudo. Furthermore the command is launched via a subshell, not by dtrace, and thus runs in the context of the dtruss script, not sudo's. To ensure no syscalls are missed by dtrace, the subshell process is started in a suspended state and resumed by the dtrace:::BEGIN action. The main 2 regressions caused by this change are:  * dtruss will not exit when the traced command finishes.  * If launching dtrace fails, the suspended subshell sticks around. Both are fairly minor and will be fixed in a future change.",0

This test hydrates every file in the functional test enlistment across many threads, and then checks that each hydration succeeded. By sending either a path (success) or exception message (failure) we can see if there are any problems in any of the threads. If there is a problem in multiple threads, then we will only see one failure. If it takes longer than 5 seconds (on average) to read a file, then the test will fail, but my run took 35 seconds to hydrate the full list, giving plenty of time. During development, I had listed the files starting at the wrong commit, and so got a ""file missing"" error that was properly reported by the test framework. The logs look horrible, since the other reads were still trying to schedule work but a blocking collection was marked for completion due to the test unmounting the repo.

In this one, UpgradeOrchestrator and ProductUpgrader are refactored so it becomes easy to incorporate Nuget upgrader in an upcoming PR. In this PR:   Create a common interface for upgraders to implement (IProductUpgrader). IProductUpgrader encapsulates the API that components need to implement to download upgrade packages from specific feeds. A feed can be a GitHub release or a NuGet feed, for examples.   UpgradeOrchestrator, which contains the logic to drive the upgrade process (including querying for updates, unmounting / remounting repositories, and orchestrating the upgrade process) works against the IProductUpgrader interface. This means the orchestration is agnostic to the specifics of where the upgrade packages are downloaded from and how they are installed.   The existing ProductUpgrader class was renamed to GitHubUpgrader, as this component works against GitHub Releases.   GitHubUpgrader implements IProductUpgrader interface.   In an upcoming PR, a NugetUpgrader component (that also implements IProductUpgrader will be created. This component will know how to download and install upgrade packages from a NuGet feed.   ProductUpgrader implements a factory method that creates an IProductUpgrader instance.

1669,Fix broken tests for cleaning modified paths,0.57491016,"Other bug fixes, engineering improvements, and test reliability fixes.","Create a new maintenance step for cleaning up the packfiles in the shared object cache. This is done in two steps:   git multi-pack-index expire: This deletes the pack-files whose objects appear in newer pack-files. The multi-pack-index prevents git from looking at these packs. Rewrites the multi-pack-index to no longer refer to these (deleted) packs.   git multi-pack-index repack --batch-size=<size> inspects packs covered by the multi-pack-index in modified-time order (ascending). Greedily selects a batch of packs whose file sizes are all less than ""size"", but that sum up to at least ""size"". Then generate a new pack-file containing the objects that are uniquely referenced by the multi-pack-index.   See this PR in microsoft/git for details of the git implementation. There are some important details:   The expire command will not delete packs that are marked with a .keep file. So, we can keep our most-recent prefetch pack around by writing a .keep file. This avoids any change to the logic for the most-recent good prefetch timestamp.   The expire command frequently fails to actually delete .idx files in a VFS for Git repo. This is due to something holding a handle to the files, as later we are able to delete them; we've seen this problem before with scripts that try to clean up the pack directory. We clean up .idx files that are not paired with a .pack after we run the expire step. This can generate warnings in the multi-pack-index write commands as it tries to add the packs based on their .idx files. The commands succeed, however.   According to the git pack-objects documentation, we should set the pack.window and pack.depth config settings to zero to avoid delta calculations. This saves significant computation time when our packs contain blobs, as the deltification algorithm can be very slow. If we were packing only commits and trees, the problem is not as significant. It is important that we don't set this globally, that way we actually compute deltas on push. Instead, just set the settings using the -c mechanism in Git. ",0

In the vnode listener, we've already been checking for this edge case, but the fileop handler thus far has not checked for file forks, and we were getting errors in the KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE events. This change moves the named stream check logic into a helper function which we can use from both vnode and fileop handlers. As this affects whether vnodes need to be released, I've unified the logic for this across the entire fileop handler. Named forks can’t be renamed or hard linked, so we don’t expect to get those events for such vnodes, and we don’t need to defend against that case there.",0

Let's unify these as much as possible, and create a framework for more background actions to happen with minimal interruption. Most of the logic happens in GitMaintenanceStep, which does the following:  Takes a new ""object cache lock"" to prevent other cleanup steps from running. This can be ignored for user-initiated prefetches (by setting RequireCacheLock to false). The RunGitCommand method safely runs an action on a GitProcess, allowing that process to be halted by the Stop() method.  The actions in these cleanup steps are best-effort: if we can't get the object cache lock, then we don't run the step. Reoccurring cleanup steps are initiated by the GitMaintenanceScheduler. This is currently only the background prefetch step. The GitMaintenanceQueue receives cleanup steps and runs them in a background thread until the queue is empty (or receives a Stop() request). It is responsible for checking if the filesystem is ready for the cleanup actions.",0

As it’s currently possible to provoke this case from user space, the assert is not a great defence as asserts will KP, so this is a potential DoS vulnerability. Even if the lengths aren’t a security issue, returning “te/path” as the result of GetRelativePath() called with “/an/absolute/path” and a root of “/some/path” doesn’t really make any sense. This change makes the length sanity check “soft” (return nullptr) and checks whether root really is a true parent of path.

Set pack.useBitmaps to false on mount time. Update Git to Git-2.19.1.gvfs.1.3.ge56ee8b, which includes a change to stop checking ambiguous refs during 'git pack-objects'. This reduces possibly thousands of file reads of the form:  .git/<oid> .git/refs/<oid> .git/refs/tags/<oid> .git/refs/heads/<oid> .git/refs/remotes/<oid> .git/refs/remotes/<oid>/HEAD By setting the config value, we don't perform these file checks for the object ids that are passed into stdin. For (1), this PR sets pack.useBitmaps to false for VFS for Git enlistments. This config value defaults to true, and during git pack-objects we check for the existence of a .bitmap file for every packfile, even those covered by the multi-pack-index.

This further increases the number of programming errors caught by the type checker. The change adds nullability attributes on all parameters of vfs_context_t type, as there are some instances where a nullptr is used (as it turns out, incorrectly) as VFS context. As soon as there is a nullability specifier on one parameter declaration in a header file, clang warns about non-annotated parameters in the same file, so all pointer parameters have been annotated in headers that use vfs_context_t.",0

2033,Small cleanups,0.61953634,Improves the rate of .gvfsCache cleanup.,"The post-fetch job runs up to two Git commands: 'git multi-pack-index write' and 'git commit-graph write'. These can each take up to 30s depending on the amount of work to do. When we unmount, we want to ensure these prcoesses terminate. Before, we were aborting the post-fetch job thread. This is not cross-platform compliant. The new approach is to store a GitProcess object and pass a Kill signal to that process during unmount. Watch that call for some possible exceptions. Also, add an additional processLock to GitProcess that holds around our state changes for the process (starting or killing the process) so we don't race by killing a process before it starts and have it start anyway. As part of revealing this GitProcess to the necessary layer, I pulled the implementation of TryWriteMultiPackIndex out of the GitObjects class. The test suite was previously exercising this code path during the functional tests, as the functional tests frequently ran faster than the background Git processes.

Update GitForWindows to use upstream multi-pack-index code instead of our private version. See the PR in Microsoft/git for more info on the Git change (and don't merge this until that is final). This does the following:  Update the command-line interactions that update the multi-pack-index. On mount, launch the post-fetch background job to ensure a multi-pack-index is calculated. (Very low cost if it already exists.) Since we have the multi-pack-index in more cases than before, we discover that we need to delete the multi-pack-index when deleting bad pack-files during prefetch. Since we trigger the post-fetch job on every mount, we now need to purposefully care about platform before shutting down the background thread. More work is required and tracked by #409.",0

In the past, we have blocked that variable for this reason. It would still be helpful to allow logging the trace output.

A background prefetch downloaded a prefetch pack containing that commit and tree, but some of the reachable trees are missing due to clock skew between cache servers.

2285,PR Feedback to cleanup disposing and returning connections to the pool,0.4708399,Improves the rate of .gvfsCache cleanup.,"GVFS currently sends a text based data across a named pipe with lines / messages separated by newline characters. This prohibits sending messages that include a newline as part of the message content. The main current manifestation of this problem is that GVFS does not handle git command lines that contain a newline character. There is another problem that GVFS needs to send paths across the named pipe (for ModifiedPathsList queries), and these paths can include newline characters on certain filesystems (macOS, Linux). Additionally, the protocol that GVFS uses to communicate across the named pipe is currently not consistent. It usually uses a text based stream, but for the ModifiedPathsList response, it uses null bytes to seperate entries in a list. To address these issues, this change tweaks the protocol used to communicate via the named pipe to use the 0x3 byte to indicate the end of a line / message (this is the End of text ASCII code).",0
