Merge pull request #1798 from neerajsi-msft/neerajsi/read-index-tickcount,0.4540103,Pull Requests,index-parser: get the time in a cheaper way,0
index-parser: Do not use DateTime.UtcNow for controlling logging.,0.59879225,- Log files now include UTC offset.,"UtcNow spends a lot of time getting a very precise system time, including leap seconds and interpolation through QueryPerformanceCounter. Use Environment.TickCount (milliseconds since boot) instead, since that just retrieves a value in shared memory that the kernel keeps up to date. This value is still suitable for controlling how much log output index parsing produces. This UtcNow call consumes 15% of the time under GitIndexParser.ParseIndex. See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/DateTime.Windows.cs.",0

Merge pull request #1719: Enforce only a minimum Git version,0.5754161,1663: Update Git to v2.27.0,"The interface between microsoft/git and VFS for Git has been stable for a while. We don't anticipate changing it any time soon. Thus, we can drop the requirement of an exact Git version match. This PR changes the current logic in a few ways:  Take the full GitVersion parsing logic from microsoft/scalar, as it is more robust. Remove the exact version match with a minimum version match. Use a fixed constant version string instead of a build-time string. Require that the Revision of the version string is an exact match. We will use this to signal that a microsoft/git version introduces a breaking change that requires a VFS for Git upgrade.  What is a Revision item? In a Git version string such as v2.X.Y.vfs.Z.W, the Revision is represented by Z. This allows us to modify the other version items arbitrarily, including taking version numbers 2.X.Y from upstream and updating .W if we have any hotfixes to microsoft/git.",0

GitObjects: use new SideChannelStream to hash during download,0.48605242,  - Correlate trace2 stream with VFS for Git stream with the Git session ID.,"The loose object download needs to verify the objects being sent across the wire before moving them to their ""real"" locations in the object directory. The previous implementation wrote them to disk then read from that file to hash the contents. Instead, create a new ""SideChannelStream"" that injects between the responseStream and the inflater, but sends all of the data that is read out to the filestream. Here is a diagram of the stream sequence: responseStream -> sideChannelStream -> inflateStream -> hashingStream                            \                                   |                 \                                 \|/                  tempFileStream                devNull By copying all data from the hashingStream into devNull, we ensure that the responseStream is drained and written to the tempFileStream while simultaneously inflating and hashing the object contents. We then amortize this computation during the window that we are downloading data over the network, minimizing the potential performance impact.

GitObjects: hash incoming loose objects,0.46918628,"- GVFS can now recover from corrupted git object files (e.g. caused by a torn write), by re-downloading them whenever git asks for an object. The assumption is that git would not be asking GVFS for it if the object was valid.","After we write the data to disk, check the file that it matches the correct hash before moving it into place. If the hash is wrong, then include details about where the data is stored for reference. This can be marked as optional to make existing unit tests work, but the logic is covered by a new set of unit tests. Signed-off-by: Derrick Stolee dstolee@microsoft.com",0

Merge pull request #1668: ProductUpgradeTimer: remove unacceptable Environment.Exit(),0.78020644,1668: ProductUPgradeTimer: remove unacceptable Environment.Exit(),"A user reported an issue via the Teams channel. Looking at the diagnose logs I saw that the user's GVFS.Service was restarting in a loop with an exception tracking down to this Environment.Exit() call. It's completely unacceptable to exit here, as it kills the service and then it restarts. Better to have no upgrades than to let this continue. The cause of this exception was a missing executable when checking ProjFS.IsGVFSUpgradeSupported(), which seems to call PowerShell. The only reason the stack would have a Win32Exception with ""The system cannot find the file specified"" is that powershell.exe is not on the PATH, which was fixed in #1658.",1
Merge pull request #1664: Update USN journal entries for projected folders,0.8177885,1664: Update USN journal entries for projected folders,"This replaces #1648. BuildXL was having issues detecting that a folder had changes when the projection changed because VFSForGit was simply updating its in memory projection and not doing anything with the file system that would trigger and update to the USN. It would hand back the new items in the directory when ProjFS would ask for the items for enumeration the next time an enumeration happened. This change is to make the folder get a new USN when VFSForGit determines that a folder has changed.  This is done by keeping a SHA1 hash of all the names of the folder entries that are in the projection. When the projection changes, calculate the new SHA for the folder and compare with what it had before.  If it changed, then write and delete a file in the folder to trigger the USN update. Note: We don't need any upgrade step because we are already storing the SHA for the folder in the placeholder database but it is currently null for all folders so the first time there is a projection change it will cause all the folders to get the calculated SHA for the folder and update the placeholder database.  Tasks:  [X] Update folder SHA-1 calculation to depend only on child names, not contents. [x] Get installer to BuildXL folks for validation. [x] Place this behavior behind a config option. [ ] Document the config option. (Delaying to #1665) [ ] Update functional test to run in CI and PR validation (behind config). (The test is updated to work behind the config, but the fsutil usn readdata <path> command isn't working in CI. Tested locally.)",1

The way we ""force"" Git to repack all is to provide a custom batch size. This batch size used to mean ""repack all pack-files with size at most X until reaching a size of at least X"". By specifying ""total size - 1"", this required repacking all objects. HOWEVER, the new logic actually computes an ""expected"" size of the objects in a pack that are referenced by the multi-pack-index. If we have duplicate objects, then those objects can cause two types of error: The duplicates reduce the total expected size below the batch size. The computation of ""total expected size"" causes round-off error. Both types of error under-count the number of bytes in the final pack-file. By changing the batch size to ""total size - min size + 1"" we ensure the following: I. The batch size is larger than the maximum pack size. II. Every pack-file is required to reach the batch size. III. We have minimized the chance that duplicate objects will drop below this threshold. With the use of gvfs-helper, we have less control over the pack-files that are downloaded as part of the clone operation. At minimum, with this change we should be in a better state than before.",0

PackfileMaintenanceStepTests: fix flaky tests,0.52142525,1697: Fix functional tests to skip around ProjFS issue,"The PackfileMaintenanceStepTests have been failing periodically, and mostly with failures in RepackAllToOnePack() leading to a failure in ExpireAllButOneAndKeep(). The way we ""force"" Git to repack all is to provide a custom batch size. This batch size used to mean ""repack all pack-files with size at most X until reaching a size of at least X"". By specifying ""total size - 1"", this required repacking all objects. HOWEVER, the new logic actually computes an ""expected"" size of the objects in a pack that are referenced by the multi-pack-index. If we have duplicate objects, then those objects can cause two types of error: The duplicates reduce the total expected size below the batch size. The computation of ""total expected size"" causes round-off error. Both types of error under-count the number of bytes in the final pack-file. By changing the batch size to ""total size - min size + 1"" we ensure the following: I. The batch size is larger than the maximum pack size. II. Every pack-file is required to reach the batch size. III. We have minimized the chance that duplicate objects will drop below this threshold. With the use of gvfs-helper, we have less control over the pack-files that are downloaded as part of the clone operation. At minimum, with this change we should be in a better state than before.

Fix mac installer/upgrader failure,0.45847845,1746: Delete custom upgrader,"VFSForGit installer fails in postinstall script while trying to launch Service and UserNotification agents in GUI context of logged in users. To determine users logged into the GUI context, postinstall script looks for loginwindow commands and the user running the command. When Fast User switching is enabled, then loginwindow can be running as root user, even though root user is Not logged in. In such cases, postinstall tries to launch Service and UserNotifcation agents in GUI context of root user (that does not exist) resulting in failure. This commit makes postinstall look for Finder command (which only runs after a user has successfully logged into GUI context and is therefore more reliably associated with GUI session) rather than loginwindow. Also Updated launchd plist for Service and Notification agents, added LimitLoadToSessionType = Aqua, just to make sure the agents get launched into the GUI context only. Fixes #1444",0

(We could, if need be, further reduce the overhead by creating two independent Compare() methods and not passing in a bool flag, and then hoisting the comparsion-mode check higher in SortedFolderEntries.GetSortedEntriesIndexOfName() so that different versions of that method were executed depending on the mode.

FileContentsShouldMatch() used to fail if both of the files didn't exist.

Merge pull request #1429 from pmj/mac-kext-182-block-offline-empty-file-access,0.43874058,- Fixed an issue on Mac where files were not being hydrated when signed as part of a build,"Mac ProjFS kext: Deny I/O on offline roots, with exceptions, part 2 This is a continuation of the work on issue #182. The remaining operations to block are:  A process attempts to read/execute an empty file in an offline root. The result of the read would be bad data, so failing with denied authorisation is preferable to letting the bad data propagate. A process attempts to create files or directories in an offline root.  The commits implementing those 2 changes are fairly straightforward, however they did cause some knock-on effects:  During gvfs clone, the git subprocess itself wants to create files/directories in the offline root, so we need it to inherit the parent gvfs process's entitlement to access offline roots. The exception check therefore now walks up the process hierarchy. One of the functional tests, CheckoutBranchWithOpenHandleBlockingProjectionDeleteAndRepoMetdataUpdate needs to mess with the repo while it's not mounted, so I've registered the test runner for offline I/O for the duration of that test. To avoid weird edge cases, I've made the offline I/O registration in the native userlib thread-safe and reference counted, so registering multiple times is fine, and we only actually deregister once it's been matched with an equal number of unregister calls.",0

Merge pull request #1428 from github/move-index-test,0.49680662,Pull Requests,"add MoveIndexFileFails() functional test On some platforms (notably Linux), we receive only a pre-rename permission request rather than a pre-delete permission request during a rename(2) operation, so the virtualization instance's OnPreRename() handler becomes responsible for ensuring that, outside of a GVFS lock, the .git/index file can not be renamed or overwritten. The BasicFileSystemTests.DeleteIndexFileFails() test handles the case of a true delete of .git/index, as well as platforms which deliver a pre-delete event on the source path prior to a rename action. As well, several GVFSLockTests tests such as the LockPreventsRenameFromInsideWorkingTreeOnTopOfIndex() test the case of a file being renamed to .git/index, but no existing test checks for the case of .git/index being renamed to another path (although DeleteIndexFileFails() likely suffices on platforms which send a pre-delete event). Therefore we add an explicit MoveIndexFileFails() functional test to cover this case.  Note that we use System.IO.File.Replace() in the SystemIORunner because File.Move() is implemented on Unix/POSIX systems such that it actually performs a copy or hard link first, then a delete, not a true rename(2).  The effect on a platform where pre-rename but not pre-delete events are delivered on rename operations is that the link succeeds, then the delete fails (since that does send a pre-delete permission request, which is denied as the path is .git/index), leaving behind a spurious extra file link.  So we want to trigger a true rename(2), which is what File.Replace() does.",0

Merge pull request #1208 from pmj/mac-kext-182-no-writes-on-offline-roots,0.43935108,Pull Requests,"Mac ProjFS: Deny I/O on offline roots, with exceptions, part 1 This is the first stage of implementing #182 - the kext now blocks write I/O to empty or placeholder files on offline roots. I/O needs to be blocked when:  A message failed to deliver to the provider. A process attempts to write to an empty file in an offline root (this file would subsequently be overwritten by a hydration event) A process attempts to write to a placeholder (hydrated unmodified) file when the provider is offline. The file would not show up in git status and could be overwritten by a subsequent checkout/rebase/merge. A process attempts to rename a file in an offline root. A process attempts to read/execute an empty file in an offline root. The result of the read would be bad data, so failing with denied authorisation is preferable to letting the bad data propagate. A process attempts to create files or directories in an offline root.  This change implements cases 1-4. Cases 5-6 will be covered in a future change. At first glance this seems like it would be a very simple change, but in practice, some processes must be allowed unfettered access to files in offline roots. So a large part of this patch set is dedicated to implementing a system for allowing exceptions - there is a new type of IOKit user client for processes which need unrestricted access to offline roots, and this needed to be implemented all the way through from kext, via native lib, to (managed) VFS4G code proper. Next, the vnode handler, which is in the actual business of denying or allowing file access, has been expanded to allow returning different results based on whether the root's provider is offline. Finally, ""deny"" results are actually returned for a number of different cases - so far, this only includes writes. Even this caused some test failures, so the test process itself needs to register as an exception with unrestricted offline root access.",0

This means the chain length will be limited by log_4(N) where N is the number of commits. This means ~6 levels is the maximum theoretical chain length with 4,000,000 commits. We are not currently using the --max-commits setting. With these settings, the git commit-graph verify command will be much faster on most new tip files.

GVFS Health Verb Initial Merge (#1249),0.5252558,- Added better diagnostic info in the GVFS logs when there are network errors,"The health verb adds analytic functionality in the form of an outward facing tool which can equip consumers to better diagnose the performance issues they see in their VFS4G repositories. It has two command line arguments, -n which specifies the number of child directories to be displayed, and -d which specifies a target directory to run the health verb in. The default for -n is 5, and then default for -d is the current working directory. It also inherits a third command line argument from GVFSVerb.ForExistingEnlistment which is an optional path to the enlistment to run the command against in the case of being outside of it. The HealthVerb is what is run from the command line, and interacts with the enlistment to get the path data needed to compute the health of the enlistment. It uses the SQLite database to get placeholder data, the named pipe to get modified paths data, and the git index to get overall enlistment data. It packages this information into a GVFSEnlistmentPathData object which is passed to the GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator. The GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator takes in a GVFSEnlistmentPathData object and then analyzes it by building a local cone of the git tree and using that cone to compute health data (hydration) for the current directory as well as minimal information about the health of its child directories (to help when searching for the root cause of a problem). It then returns a GVFSEnlistmentHealthData object containing all of the corresponding data. The GVFSEnlistmentHealthCalculator is unit tested by the GVFSEnlistmentHealthTests unit test file.

Enable display of Automount notifications,0.35126305,Initial Mac platform native notifications,"This is the third incremental PR to enable platform native notifications on the Mac. In this PR, GVFS.Service sends auto-mount notifications to VFS For Git.app for display to user. Service displays notification for auto-mount failures only - when it fails to auto-mount a repository that has been registered for auto-mount. Details - New VFSForGitNotification class. It supports 3 different notifications   - AutomountStart, MountSuccess, MountFailure. It will not display any   other notification. - VFSForGitNotification defines the title & message body for each of the   supported notification. It is not possible for GVFS.Service or another   client to display random text. - MessageListener class creates a socket and waits for notification   requests from client. - MessageParser class to parse the incoming JSON formatted message   text. - New UT for VFSForGitNotification & MessageParser classes. - GVFS.Service does not wait for a reply from VFS For Git.app for the   notification requests that it sends. - VFS For Git.app get automatically launched after installation. - VFS For Git.app has the same app version as gvfs version. - Updated MacServiceTests to not use INotificationHandler to verify   Automount start.

Merge pull request #1278: Fix performance regression in LibGit2RepoInvoker,0.5966643,"The merge strategy default is changed from recursive to ort which should present significant performance improvements for commands such as git merge, git rebase, and git cherry-pick. Huge thanks to external contributor @newren for creating this new merge strategy!","Today, we noticed a performance regression from 1.0.19074.2 to 1.0.19130.1 (M150). In that release, we changed the way we allocate and refresh LibGit2Repo objects. In order to allow packfile deletions, we need to drop the handles that LibGit2 keeps open during the duration of the LibGit2Repo. The change was to share one repo object and to dispose of it after 15 minutes of inactivity. However, that doesn't take into account the startup time required to initialize the data. This can be a lot worse if the user has thousands of pack-files. To fix this, change the model. With this change, the PackfileMaintenanceStep will request that the LibGit2Repos are closed before performing the expire command, and then will reinitialize the LibGit2 repo right after. This will keep the ""warmup"" time as part of the initial mount or as the background operation. If the read-object hook or a file hydration comes in while the expire command is running, a LibGit2 repo will be initialized and it may cause some .idx files to stick around until the next run. This was already the case, but then the warmup would happen during those operations. This will happen at most once a day.   How did you find this was the issue?   @jrbriggs gets all the credit for realizing that the performance difference between versions only happened in calls where one used the read-object hook. If the read-object hook wasn't called, then there was no difference in the performance numbers. But there was a significant slowdown if the read-object hook was called, and could even be several seconds for a single object. From that, I started spelunking the diff and looked specifically at what changed around the logic in InProcessMount for downloading an object. There were two candidates: i. The interaction with the Git credential manager had a lot of changes. I checked with @jamill about his expectations of performance numbers there, even if it is misbehaving. He and @jeschu1 thought there was no reason for more than 100ms of delay in any of that code, and other side-effects would be very visible if it required more server connections. This led me to focus hard on item (ii). ii. The LibGit2RepoInvoker was updated in this release to no longer create a large pool of repos at mount time and only dispose of them at process end. We had shipped this independently of the packfile maintenance for this very reason of being safe, but I had anticipated any problems would be in the multi-threaded access of a single libgit2 repo. The multi-threaded access has not been a problem, as far as I can tell.   How did you test the performance of this change?   To measure this, I made a change like in this commit to use a Stopwatch around the two operations. This would easily point to which of the two options above were likely the cause. After installing that version locally and running git grep foo to trigger loose object downloads, I saw the timing for the first read-object hook had 2.5 seconds in the TryGetIsBlob() method, and all subsequent calls were ~2 milliseconds. This was on my local repo where I had inflated the pack dir to ~800 packs. If a user has 7,000+ then libgit2 will take even longer to prep the packfile data structures. This performance testing also led me to double-check this PR and notice that the first run was still slow. The trick was to add the commit ""LibGit2RepoInvoker: Test a real SHA1 when initializing"" because using an empty SHA-1 seems to short-cut somewhere in the logic and not actually load the object store data in the LibGit2Repo. With that change, I see all of my TryGetIsBlob() calls taking 1-2 milliseconds again, even the first one after a PackfileMaintenanceStep. Resolves #1277",0

ProductUpgrader: copy whole upgrade application,0.5841005,1672: ProductUpgrader: be extra careful about a copy loop,"When upgrading VFS for Git via the built-in upgrade logic, the upgrade verb will copy the upgrader application to a temporary directory, and run the upgrade app from the temporary directory. The main reason for this is so that the upgrade application can update the original application without open file handles getting in the way (and preventing the deletion of the application that is being updated). The upgrade verb currently has a hard coded list of dependencies (files) required for the upgrader application to run. This can be fragile as we need to keep this list in sync with the actual dependencies, across multiple platforms. This can easily break if the dependencies change, and we update the list of files included with the installer, but not with the upgrader application. A specific occurrence of this happened in #1144. Instead, just copy over the whole VFS for Git application directory when creating a temporary copy of the upgrader application to run. We might copy over a few additional files, but this should not cause any noticeable downsides.",0

Merge pull request #1213: Prefetch tests: Delete multi-pack-index before indexing a pack,0.5615121,"* Added a new mutli-pack index file to git, allowing it to become much more efficient at finding an object when there are a large number of local packfiles","This test deletes an existing .idx file, and then checks that VFS for Git calls git index-pack when scanning the pack-files. When we take Git 2.22.0, this test starts to fail. The fix is to delete the multi-pack-index before rebuilding the .idx. This is a reasonable expectation because we won't have a pack covered by the multi-pack-index without having the corresponding .idx file. The reason this broke with Git 2.22.0 is a bit subtle: When running git index-pack, Git looks for duplicate objects in order to check for SHA-1 collisions. When the multi-pack-index includes the objects in the pack, Git sees what it thinks are the same object ids and goes to load the content to verify they are equal. In Git 2.22.0, we solved the ""many packs"" problem by adding the pack-files from the multi-pack-index to the packed_git linked list. Adding to this list will fail if there is no corresponding .idx file. (The multi-pack-index prevents any reads into this .idx file, but existence is required.) This means that the content lookup fails and Git complains with ""fatal: cannot read existing object info"" This will unblock taking Git 2.22.0 after the release. See microsoft/git#140 for details on that update.",0

PrjFS kext testing: Fixes newly failing disappearing provider tests,0.6378133,1697: Fix functional tests to skip around ProjFS issue,"Two HandleVnodeOperationTests used ProviderMessageMock_SetCleanupRootsAfterRequest() to force removal of the (mock) provider. This caused the mock version of ProviderMessaging_TrySendRequestAndWaitForResponse() to call VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup(). This was problematic for 2 reasons:  VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup() does not just disconnect the provider, it wipes the entire root array, making any handles invalid. This never actually happens in the real kext. Any such sledgehammer approach has actually been prevented by assertions in the kext code. Now that those kick in during unit testing, this made the tests in question fail in multiple ways.  The fix is therefore to replace the call to VirtualizationRoots_Cleanup() with the more appropriate ActiveProvider_Disconnect(). Rather than special-casing this, ProviderMessageMock_SetCleanupRootsAfterRequest() has been replaced with ProviderMessageMock_SetRequestSideEffect() which allows setting a lambda expression to run in the mock version of ProviderMessaging_TrySendRequestAndWaitForResponse(). In the tests in question, it is the lambda that calls ActiveProvider_Disconnect().",0
PrjFS Kext tests: Adds kext assert() integration for unit tests,0.564334,1697: Fix functional tests to skip around ProjFS issue,"Previously, assert() has been disabled (MACH_ASSERT macro not defined) in the testable kext build, so no failing assertions in the kext have been caught during unit testing. This change:  Enables assertions in the testable kext build. Implements the back-end Assert() and panic() functions used by the assert() and assertf() macros, respectively. These back-end functions call into XCTest's test failure reporting mechanism, so failed kext assertions in unit tests are now reported as regular unit test failures. To facilitate this, the current test case needs to be known outside the test's Objective-C class, so we track that in thread-local storage by subclassing XCTestCase and deriving all tests from the new class, and perform current test registration/deregistration during setUp/tearDown. Some unit tests deliberately cause failed assertions, so a mechanism for ignoring a specific number of them in a test is provided. Not having full coverage in panic/Assert/etc. is a good thing, so those have been added to the 100% test coverage exceptions",0
Fix installer auto-mount failure,0.4885446,- The installer now unmounts and remounts existing repos automatically,"Mac installer relies on GVFS.Service to do the auto-mount of registered repos. When GVFS.Service gets launched (post installation) it (Service) calls gvfs mount in the background (without user interaction). In this case if the kext is not loaded, then mount will fail. Updating the installer to load kext would help in scenario. Also updated postflight script to log output of kextstat command that is used to determine if macOS autoloaded kext or not. A non empty output means kext got autoloaded or there was an error running kextstat. Fixes #1210",0

After weakening the tests, but still finding places where the loose object count is not deterministic, I thought it was worth starting over with the full list of exact-count assertions. To avoid loose objects being added or dropped from the counts in unexpected ways, now we unmount the repo before counting the objects. I ran the functional tests 20 times on this PR and only one failure, but it was in the GVFS.FunctionalTests.Tests.EnlistmentPerFixture.GitReadAndGitLockTests.GitAliasNamedAfterKnownCommandAcquiresLock() test, unrelated to this change.

The only reason this can happen (as I see it) is that we are downloading a loose object due to the virtualization layer, and that file exists in a pack somehow. This causes us to delete or add an object during the LooseObjectsStep and have off-by-one errors. Instead of seeing 160 objects (for example) we see 159 or 161. Relax the test conditions to verify that we did not delete all of the loose objects during the steps instead of requiring the count is exact. (We already relaxed this in one direction in #1116.)",0

ProjectedFSLib: do not copy into GVFS.Platform.Windows output dir,0.52366686,Switched over to use the Windows Projected File System (ProjFS) optional feature on RS4 and later. ProjFS is the new name for the GvFlt driver and its associated user mode library.,"Currently, ProjectedFSLib.dll is expected to be copied into the GVFS.Platform.Windows output directory during a build, and from there is copied into the installer. Due to how this is included in the project, it is not consistently copied into the GVFS.Platform.Windows output directory, and this can cause a build failure simiar to: Error on line in C:\Sources\Vfs4Git\src\GVFS\GVFS.Installer.Windows\Setup.iss: Source file ""C:\Sources\Vfs4Git\src\..\BuildOutput\GVFS.Windows\bin\x64\Debug\ProjectedFSLib.dll"" does not exist. To fix this, we could fix the project setup to have the file copied over consistently. However, this file is not needed by the GVFS.Platform.Windows project. Post RS4, ProjectedFSLib.dll should be provided by the operating system and not copied over the product. Previously, the product had to bring over its own copy of ProjectedFSLib.dll, as it was not providided by the OS. By now, we expect developers to have moved to a version of Windows that includes this the ProjectedFSLib.dll component in box. This also means:   We can remove logic for deleting this file as part of a post build   step on systems where this file should not be provided by the product.   We have to include the ProjFSLib.dll dependency into the Windows   unit test project. Otherwise, running the unit test will fail on   systems that do not have the projfs feature enabled. ",0

To   resolve this issue, make sure the same settings are used for restore and for   subsequent operations such as build or publish. Typically this issue can occur   if the RuntimeIdentifier property is set during build or publish but not during   restore. For more information, see   https://aka.ms/dotnet-runtime-patch-selection. My understanding is that this can happen when the runtime used by the restore operation does not match the runtime expected by the publish operation. As the publish operation might not call restore itself, it will generate this error when the runtime does not match the expected version. To fix this, the projects that generate self-contained applications will also set the TargetLatestRuntimePatch property to target the latest runtime.",0

update libgit2 native binary and include for Linux,0.45298818,1706: Update Git to include GCM Core update,"Upgrade the LibGit2Sharp.NativeBinaries NuGet package from v1.0.165 (containing LibGit2Sharp v0.23.1) to v2.0.278, which contains the latest LibGit2Sharp release v0.26. LibGit2Sharp version 0.26 eliminates most external library dependencies other than OpenSSL.  In particular, by removing the dependency on libcurl, there is no longer a link-time requirement for a version of libcurl with deprecated CURL_OPENSSL_3 symbols and SSLv3 support.

This PR introduces the concept of a ""local storage root"", defined as the directory where actual stored objects are located. On platforms where filters are used (Windows and Mac), this is the same as the working directory root -- the hydrated files (and the .git directory) exist physically in place. On layered filesystems, the objects are stored in a separate directory (currently .gvfs/lower relative to the enlistment root). We need to be sure to make accesses to .git in this directory, not via the projection.",0

However, it doesn't throw when the Stop() call happens during the Git process. This requires extra handling of the Stopping boolean after receiving a response from RunGitCommand(). Such extra handling was added in #1064, but would not be necessary with this change. The better thing to do is to throw the StoppingException after the Git process completes. Add a unit test that verifies we automatically skip the remainder of a PerformMaintenance() method in a subclass. Looking through the error logs, all logged instances of a failure during 'commit-graph verify' or 'multi-pack-index verify' are actually due to this issue. Otherwise we would see errors from GitMaintenanceStep saying ""Git process {command} failed with errors:"" and those messages do no appear in the logs.",0

Credentials: always reject credentials with just a URL,0.5509623,  - Now approves credentials on authentication success,"In commit e41f25f7, the username and password was including in the call to reject credentials. However, with GCM 1.18.5, this does not result in the credentials being rejected. This is due to a behavior with the main credential helper - Credentials acquired from Windows GCM for dev.azure.com urls are not round-tripable. A credential acquired via credential fill from Windows GCM for a dev.azure.com URL cannot successfully be rejected when including the username / password. To make this work, only reject credentials by URL. The downside is that we might attempt to erase a credential that is not the current credential for a URL, but this is a tradeoff to have the scenario work in general. When this behavior is corrected in the credential helper used by VFS4G, we can make reject credentials more specifically.",0
Credentials: consistently use usehttppath for dev.azure.com scope,0.8753866,  - Now scopes credential.useHttpPath to just dev.azure.com hostname,"The git credential commands are not consistent in whether they set usehttppath or not. This can lead to inconsistencies in how credentials are generatated and cleared. VFSForGit might retrieve / create credentials using the full http path, but clear with the only the host name. This leads to the incorrect behavior where VFSForGit is unable to erase bad / stale credentials. Additionally, only dev.azure.com URLs need to set the useHttpPath setting - so scope it to these URLs.",1

However, very rarely, when a root's vnode is recycled and the new one is encountered, FindRootAtVnode_Locked() will refresh the registered vnode in the virtualization root. When only the shared lock is held, this could potentially cause a race between 2 or more threads. In theory, all threads involved should reach the same conclusion and update to the same vnode, so there should not be any actual data corruption. This change fixes the race by not refreshing the vnode in FindRootAtVnode_Locked() and instead performing the refresh in a new helper function, which is only called when the lock is held exclusively.",0

In many cases, this only mattered once a virtualisation root's vnode had been recycled, but if the first event for a root was for a file in that root, and not the root itself, the root's entry in the array could become corrupted with the vnode on the next event for the original event's file. When this corruption happened while a provider was connected, disconnecting would cause vnode_put() to be called on the file, not the root directory vnode, leading to the panic.

Mac dtruss: Basic documentation,0.39518052,1669: Docs: more troubleshooting and FAQs,This adds some simple instructions on how to use our version of dtruss.,0
Mac dtruss: Fixes for follow mode.,0.33538684,Bug fixes:,"Following child processes (-f) in dtruss has not worked reliably on Mac, at least not in recent OS versions. There are a few reasons for this:  Thread recycling behaviour means the self->child variable doesn't get wiped when a thread exits or a process dies, so random other processes end up with threads which suddenly start being traced. dtruss assumed new processes were always started with fork/execve or vfork/execve, entirely ignoring posix_spawn, which is much more common on macOS. The logging of newly detected threads in child processes was odd, implying each of them was caused by a fork() which of course is not the case. If traced parent processes died, newly created threads in child processes may fail to be traced.  This change fixes all of the above. The key changes:  The self->child thread-local variable identifying threads as being part of processes which are descendents of processes which match the original criteria now stores the PID, not simply a boolean. This lets us detect the case where threads are recycled. The self->start variable suffers from the same problem, causing the first syscall of a recycled thread to be traced, even if self->child has been cleaned up. There is special support for tracing through the various stages of posix_spawn in order to mark the newly spawned child process. The default buffer size for dynamic DTrace variables is hugely increased, as the script in its current state seems to consume a lot of memory.",0
Mac dtruss: adds a command-line flag for filtering noisy syscalls,0.24065503,Background tasks run with lower priority to address user feedback on maintenance job performance.,"Currently this just applies to one case: close() when it returns EBADF. It seems that some processes (clang?) will call close() on thousands of file descriptors that don't exist, which totally floods the trace. Specifying -F will now remove those calls from the trace; if -c (counts) are enabled, the filtered calls will still be counted in the overall statistic; additionally, the number of ignored close() calls for each process is tracked and output.",0
Mac dtruss: Fix for non-command regressions & dangling subshell,0.2946208,- Fixed an annoying bug where a Ctrl+C'd git process could leak a GVFS lock,"The command-launching changes caused dtrace to error out on other modes; this adds command line arguments to fix that.

Mac dtruss: Improve tracing of syscall with string/buffer parameters,0.3105253,- No-op gvfs prefetch --hydrate performance is dramatically improved,"Tracing certain syscalls such as read/write would sometimes trigger dtrace errors for one of the following reasons:  NULL pointer passed by caller. This change adds safety checks for these. Buffer is very large, so copyin() runs out of scratch memory. This change limits the copied buffer contents to 1024 bytes.",0
Mac dtruss: Adds proper formatting for tracing posix_spawn,0.31611717,1744: Overhaul build and project systems and drop Mac/POSIX code,"Dtruss so far has had no direct support for tracing posix_spawn, so just fell back to printing 3 integer arguments, which isn't terribly useful. The function has 6 arguments, so this change causes all of them to be saved until return and printed. The second argument (arg1) is the string of the executable file's path; this needs to be copied from usermem on syscall entry as copyinstr sometimes seems to fail in the return probe. The first argument (arg0) is a pointer to a memory location to which the created process's PID will be written, so we need to read the PID from usermem in order to print it.",0
Mac dtruss: Fixes tracing of execve() syscall,0.307997,1669: Docs: more troubleshooting and FAQs,"dtruss was written for Solaris and last updated for an ancient version of macOS. (then Mac OS X) Somewhere along the way, tracing for execve() got broken - the printed PID was wrong, and printing the executable's path did not work. The reason for the former is unclear, in the return probe the pid simply evaluates to 0. That just seems to be a kernel quirk. By saving the correct value in a thread-local variable on syscall entry, we can print that on return. The executable path can't be printed as the string resides in user space memory, and after execve() returns, the whole userspace process has been replaced. So again the solution is to save the syscall argument on :entry for :return to print it.",0
Mac dtruss: Adds support for running commands as non-root,0.24103051,1740: Skip launching UI if running unattended,"The existing dtruss script suffered the significant flaw that commands/processes launched via the dtruss command line could only be run as root as dtruss itself could only be run as root. This change allows the dtruss script itself to be run as non-root when passing a command by explicitly invoking dtrace using sudo. Furthermore the command is launched via a subshell, not by dtrace, and thus runs in the context of the dtruss script, not sudo's. To ensure no syscalls are missed by dtrace, the subshell process is started in a suspended state and resumed by the dtrace:::BEGIN action. The main 2 regressions caused by this change are:  * dtruss will not exit when the traced command finishes.  * If launching dtrace fails, the suspended subshell sticks around. Both are fairly minor and will be fixed in a future change.",0

Add out-of-proc telemetry daemon event listener,0.27260038,1740: Skip launching UI if running unattended,"Add a new telemetry event listener which sends JSON messages to a named pipe for out-of-proc dispatch to ETW/AI. The new listener can exist alongside any existing 'platform-specific' telemetry listeners (such as the ETW listener that is in-proc). Events/messages sent by the listener are 'fire-and-forget'; we do not retry and we do not wait any length of time for the pipe to be ready. The rationale here is that we do not want to introduce delay to the execution of the application for only telemetry events. Also if the current system does not have anyone listening on the telemetry named pipe then every message would delay the application execution by the pipe connection timeout(!) We continue to guard the telemetry listener's activation on the presence of the gvfs.telemetry-id global configuration entry, just like the existing in-proc ETW provider. The only difference is that now we don't care what the value of that config entry is, just that it is set. (The in-proc ETW listener uses the value for the ETW iKey which is stored in the daemon's logic instead now.)",0

If it takes longer than 5 seconds (on average) to read a file, then the test will fail, but my run took 35 seconds to hydrate the full list, giving plenty of time. During development, I had listed the files starting at the wrong commit, and so got a ""file missing"" error that was properly reported by the test framework.

The following scenario should work: Running the command ""dotnet test"" on the GVFS.UnitTest project should build   and run the assocated unit tests.

This change is to allow developers to build the GVFS.Platform.Mac project using msbuild on the command line and enable the use of ""dotnet build"" and ""dotnet test"" commands. The current build setup assumes that libPrjFSLib has been built and exists, and always attempts to copy it to the final BuildOutput directory. However, this native project is not directly built by the msbuild system, which relies on the BuildGVFSForMac build script to make sure it is built as expected. This causes problems with building the GVFS.Platform.Mac project directly. It also prevents us from running the unit tests without also building the native project.",0

Merge pull request #628 Upgrade refactoring to enable Nuget upgrades,0.60046196,- Upgrade supports NuGet feeds as a distribution source.,"Refactor VFS4Git upgrade logic to support upgrade extensibility This is the first PR of a series of changes to enable upgrade extensibility. In this one, UpgradeOrchestrator and ProductUpgrader are refactored so it becomes easy to incorporate Nuget upgrader in an upcoming PR. In this PR:   Create a common interface for upgraders to implement (IProductUpgrader). IProductUpgrader encapsulates the API that components need to implement to download upgrade packages from specific feeds. A feed can be a GitHub release or a NuGet feed, for examples.   UpgradeOrchestrator, which contains the logic to drive the upgrade process (including querying for updates, unmounting / remounting repositories, and orchestrating the upgrade process) works against the IProductUpgrader interface. This means the orchestration is agnostic to the specifics of where the upgrade packages are downloaded from and how they are installed.   The existing ProductUpgrader class was renamed to GitHubUpgrader, as this component works against GitHub Releases.   GitHubUpgrader implements IProductUpgrader interface.   In an upcoming PR, a NugetUpgrader component (that also implements IProductUpgrader will be created. This component will know how to download and install upgrade packages from a NuGet feed.   ProductUpgrader implements a factory method that creates an IProductUpgrader instance. It can be GithubUpgrader (orNugetUpgrader in an upcoming PR) based on Local GVFS Configuration.   gvfs upgrade using existing Github/release upgrade works. UT also work.   End-to-End The features/upgrade_extensibility branch contains a preview of the end-to-end functionality. It includes a rough version of the upgrader that works with a NuGet feed. It can be used as a guide to see how we envision other upgraders to plug into the scaffolding being built in this PR.",0

Merge pull request #635 PackfileMaintenanceStep,0.5048815,Pull Requests,"Create a new maintenance step for cleaning up the packfiles in the shared object cache. This is done in two steps:   git multi-pack-index expire: This deletes the pack-files whose objects appear in newer pack-files. The multi-pack-index prevents git from looking at these packs. Rewrites the multi-pack-index to no longer refer to these (deleted) packs.   git multi-pack-index repack --batch-size=<size> inspects packs covered by the multi-pack-index in modified-time order (ascending). Greedily selects a batch of packs whose file sizes are all less than ""size"", but that sum up to at least ""size"". Then generate a new pack-file containing the objects that are uniquely referenced by the multi-pack-index.   See this PR in microsoft/git for details of the git implementation. There are some important details:   The expire command will not delete packs that are marked with a .keep file. So, we can keep our most-recent prefetch pack around by writing a .keep file. This avoids any change to the logic for the most-recent good prefetch timestamp.   The expire command frequently fails to actually delete .idx files in a VFS for Git repo. This is due to something holding a handle to the files, as later we are able to delete them; we've seen this problem before with scripts that try to clean up the pack directory. We clean up .idx files that are not paired with a .pack after we run the expire step. This can generate warnings in the multi-pack-index write commands as it tries to add the packs based on their .idx files. The commands succeed, however.   According to the git pack-objects documentation, we should set the pack.window and pack.depth config settings to zero to avoid delta calculations. This saves significant computation time when our packs contain blobs, as the deltification algorithm can be very slow. If we were packing only commits and trees, the problem is not as significant. It is important that we don't set this globally, that way we actually compute deltas on push. Instead, just set the settings using the -c mechanism in Git. ",0

This means that if there is no PrjFS service running (the kext isn't loaded), it will sit and wait for it to turn up. Likewise, if the kext is unloaded, the logging infrastructure for that instance is cleanly torn down.

In the vnode listener, we've already been checking for this edge case, but the fileop handler thus far has not checked for file forks, and we were getting errors in the KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE events. This change moves the named stream check logic into a helper function which we can use from both vnode and fileop handlers. As this affects whether vnodes need to be released, I've unified the logic for this across the entire fileop handler. Named forks can’t be renamed or hard linked, so we don’t expect to get those events for such vnodes, and we don’t need to defend against that case there.",0

That calculation can take 10's of seconds on a large graph, and users can now opt out of it.","The post-fetch job and background prefetch features used different mechanisms to run in the background. Let's unify these as much as possible, and create a framework for more background actions to happen with minimal interruption. Most of the logic happens in GitMaintenanceStep, which does the following:  Takes a new ""object cache lock"" to prevent other cleanup steps from running. This can be ignored for user-initiated prefetches (by setting RequireCacheLock to false). The RunGitCommand method safely runs an action on a GitProcess, allowing that process to be halted by the Stop() method.  The actions in these cleanup steps are best-effort: if we can't get the object cache lock, then we don't run the step. Reoccurring cleanup steps are initiated by the GitMaintenanceScheduler. This is currently only the background prefetch step. The GitMaintenanceQueue receives cleanup steps and runs them in a background thread until the queue is empty (or receives a Stop() request). It is responsible for checking if the filesystem is ready for the cleanup actions.",0

Mac kext: Minor logging improvements,0.3908307,Adds additional logging for folder and file placeholder creation.," Message response type is an unvalidated integer, so we should log if it’s out of range.

Mac kext: Tightening up string handling for relative paths,0.3491545,Large improvements to git checkout performance when there are many folder placeholders.,"It is possible that the GetRelativePath() function is called with a root path that is not actually a parent path of the absolute path. As this would lead to a buffer overrun if the root path was longer than the absolute path, we had an assert “defending” against that case. As it’s currently possible to provoke this case from user space, the assert is not a great defence as asserts will KP, so this is a potential DoS vulnerability. Even if the lengths aren’t a security issue, returning “te/path” as the result of GetRelativePath() called with “/an/absolute/path” and a root of “/some/path” doesn’t really make any sense. This change makes the length sanity check “soft” (return nullptr) and checks whether root really is a true parent of path. This includes detecting that “/an/a” is not in fact a parent of “/an/absolute/path” although it is a string prefix of it.",0

Huge thanks to external contributor @newren for creating this new merge strategy!","This PR does two things that are super-easy fixes for improving 'git push' performance.  Set pack.useBitmaps to false on mount time. Update Git to Git-2.19.1.gvfs.1.3.ge56ee8b, which includes a change to stop checking ambiguous refs during 'git pack-objects'. This reduces possibly thousands of file reads of the form:  .git/<oid> .git/refs/<oid> .git/refs/tags/<oid> .git/refs/heads/<oid> .git/refs/remotes/<oid> .git/refs/remotes/<oid>/HEAD By setting the config value, we don't perform these file checks for the object ids that are passed into stdin. For (1), this PR sets pack.useBitmaps to false for VFS for Git enlistments. This config value defaults to true, and during git pack-objects we check for the existence of a .bitmap file for every packfile, even those covered by the multi-pack-index. Each of these checks took 2-3 seconds on my small test. I hope to get better numbers before merging, but want to see our scale tests.",0

The change adds nullability attributes on all parameters of vfs_context_t type, as there are some instances where a nullptr is used (as it turns out, incorrectly) as VFS context. As soon as there is a nullability specifier on one parameter declaration in a header file, clang warns about non-annotated parameters in the same file, so all pointer parameters have been annotated in headers that use vfs_context_t.",0

Merge pull request #420 PostFetchJob: Kill running Git process when unmounting,0.63136846,- Fixed a bug that would cause VFS for Git mount process to shut down if it receives out-of-order ProjFS callbacks.,"The post-fetch job runs up to two Git commands: 'git multi-pack-index write' and 'git commit-graph write'. These can each take up to 30s depending on the amount of work to do. When we unmount, we want to ensure these prcoesses terminate. Before, we were aborting the post-fetch job thread. This is not cross-platform compliant. The new approach is to store a GitProcess object and pass a Kill signal to that process during unmount. Watch that call for some possible exceptions. Also, add an additional processLock to GitProcess that holds around our state changes for the process (starting or killing the process) so we don't race by killing a process before it starts and have it start anyway. As part of revealing this GitProcess to the necessary layer, I pulled the implementation of TryWriteMultiPackIndex out of the GitObjects class. The test suite was previously exercising this code path during the functional tests, as the functional tests frequently ran faster than the background Git processes. That should give some good data on how this works. Resolves #409",0

This does the following:  Update the command-line interactions that update the multi-pack-index. On mount, launch the post-fetch background job to ensure a multi-pack-index is calculated. (Very low cost if it already exists.) Since we have the multi-pack-index in more cases than before, we discover that we need to delete the multi-pack-index when deleting bad pack-files during prefetch.

When a ProfileSample instance is created, the Mach absolute time is taken, and when it is destroyed, another time stamp is taken, and the interval recorded with the sample aggregation probe ID specified during construction. Additionally, split time samples can be taken. The number of samples, total runtime, sum of squares, minimum, and maximum values are recorded. From these, mean and standard deviation can be derived. An external method for extracting the profiling data from the kernel has been added to the logging user client class. The simple log tool has been extended to fetch and dump this data to stdout every 15 seconds.",0

Where indices were previously used outside the VirtualizationRoot implementation functions, the terminology has been changed to ""handles."" An immediate advantage of the move away from pointers is an improvement in the ability to control thread safety of the root structures; additionally, unlike pointers, handles remain valid outside of held locks, so in a follow-on change, we can reallocate the array for resizing.",0

This version brings with it improvements to unpack_trees to speed up checkout, merge, reset, and rebase.","On Clone, we need to create the .git/index file during a checkout, which requires having all trees reachable from the root tree of the tip commit. To ensure we have all of the objects, we call TryDownloadCommit(). However, this method doesn't actually try downloading a pack of trees if we already have the commit and root tree. Due to the shared object cache, we may have these objects for a few reasons:  A recent fetch included a ref update that points to that commit, and we downloaded the commit and tree as loose objects. A background prefetch downloaded a prefetch pack containing that commit and tree, but some of the reachable trees are missing due to clock skew between cache servers.  This fixes the issue by forcibly downloading the packfile if the checkout fails and trying again. Resolves #306.",0

Tweak the protocol GVFS used to communicate over named pipes,0.46905342,"* The client will now also query the /gvfs/sizes endpoint on a cache server that implements that endpoint, reducing the latency on those requests even further","GVFS currently sends a text based data across a named pipe with lines / messages separated by newline characters. This prohibits sending messages that include a newline as part of the message content. The main current manifestation of this problem is that GVFS does not handle git command lines that contain a newline character. There is another problem that GVFS needs to send paths across the named pipe (for ModifiedPathsList queries), and these paths can include newline characters on certain filesystems (macOS, Linux). Additionally, the protocol that GVFS uses to communicate across the named pipe is currently not consistent. It usually uses a text based stream, but for the ModifiedPathsList response, it uses null bytes to seperate entries in a list. To address these issues, this change tweaks the protocol used to communicate via the named pipe to use the 0x3 byte to indicate the end of a line / message (this is the End of text ASCII code).",0

Performance improvements: - We have moved MIDX computation to a post-fetch thread. This should save blocking time per prefetch that downloads a packfile from the cache server. - We have enabled the generation of the serialized commit graph in the post-fetch thread. This should provide across-the-board perf wins in any command that walks many commits. - Improved the memory usage during MIDX computation. - Further optimizations to GVFS's index parsing, saving time on commands that need to reproject (like checkout). - Use commit graph generation numbers during force push, saving time on force pushes.",1
Major updates:,0.99999994,Major updates:,"* Switched over to use the Windows Projected File System (ProjFS) optional feature on RS4 and later. ProjFS is the new name for the GvFlt driver and its associated user mode library. * The local file size cache was migrated from ESENT to SQLite * Git commands are now allowed to delete an empty directory * Many other reliability improvements in interactions between GVFS and the file system, and between GVFS and git Perf improvements: * Better memory management in git, creating a savings of up to half a second on commands that parse the index * Added a new mutli-pack index file to git, allowing it to become much more efficient at finding an object when there are a large number of local packfiles * Added a git config setting to disable the calculations for detecting force pushes during 'git fetch' and 'git pull'. That calculation can take 10's of seconds on a large graph, and users can now opt out of it. * Due to the transition to SQLite, the file sizes cache can now live in the volume-wide .gvfsCache folder and be shared by multiple repos, causing fewer round trips to the server while enumerating files * The post-command step to update placeholder files now batches its size requests to the server, resulting in significant speedups in situations where many placeholder files needed to be updated * The client will now also query the /gvfs/sizes endpoint on a cache server that implements that endpoint, reducing the latency on those requests even further * Sped up GVFS's parsing of the git index, shaving off 2-3 seconds for a large index file",1
New features:,1.0000001,New features:,"- Added a new volume-wide cache for downloaded git objects that is shared amongst multiple repos. Only newly created repos will use the new cache location. Existing clones will continue to use their own private cache. - The installer now unmounts and remounts existing repos automatically - GVFS no longer forces an antivirus exclusion. This was a relic from long ago when the gvflt driver and the Defender driver used to interfere with each other, but antivirus is no longer GVFS's concern. - Added better diagnostic info in the GVFS logs when there are network errors - git status now supports an option to avoid doing its ahead/behind calculations. This allows the user to decide if they want to skip that overhead if all they care about is the status of the working directory. Bug fixes: - Lots of bug fixes to make GVFS's file writes (e.g. to its database files) more reliable, even in the face of power loss - GVFS can now recover from corrupted git object files (e.g. caused by a torn write), by re-downloading them whenever git asks for an object. The assumption is that git would not be asking GVFS for it if the object was valid. - Fixed an annoying bug where a Ctrl+C'd git process could leak a GVFS lock",1
