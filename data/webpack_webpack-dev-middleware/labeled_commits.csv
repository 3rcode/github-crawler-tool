Tests for #270   Code style adherence   Attempt to appease the Linux spirits   The pathabs call wasn't treating c:\ as absolute on Linux, so it was still prepending the /, and hence failing out the test. Now instead we call both the posix and win32 versions of the function explicitly, same as is done in the setFs call.
