Fix Windows Paths (#276),0.5939749,On windows path spaces should resolve to %20 (#288)," fixes #270: bad filename generation  Uses an existing dependency in the module to test if the generated filename is absolute before adding the leading slash. This is the most minimal fix for the Windows incompatibility that doesn't break a bunch of test cases that currently pass on Windows, and which won't run afoul of the filesystem abstraction layer used by Webpack.   Tests for #270   Code style adherence   Attempt to appease the Linux spirits   The pathabs call wasn't treating c:\ as absolute on Linux, so it was still prepending the /, and hence failing out the test. Now instead we call both the posix and win32 versions of the function explicitly, same as is done in the setFs call. That feels dirty to me, but this is already fairly dirty, and I don't think this opens any kind of path attack vector that wasn't already present.",0

Support Range requests commonly used by media,0.40351048,Fix range support not working (#116).,"Seeking through media, such as audio and video, often leads a browser to make range requests, in addition to other scenarios. Responding with the full content instead of the requested range and can lead to unexpected behaviour in a web application that in production will otherwise work since the production server supports range requests.  Depend on range-parser to parse range request headers Use source from the send npm package on responding to range   requests https://github.com/pillarjs/send/blob/31ceb6aaf530152c29a1855bf3f9dbd86533303e/index.js#L551-L583",0

We could explicitly import path.posix, but since this same JS file already includes a generic path.join that seems to work in enough cases for us, it seems OK to just use that.",0
