Notes

now you can use webpack.config.mjs and webpack.config.js with { ""type"": ""module"" } in package.json
you can avoid using the cross-env package:

Before:
json
{
    ""scripts"": {
        ""build"": ""cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config build/webpack.config.js""
    }
}
Now (you can remove the cross-env if you don't use it somewhere else):
json
{
    ""scripts"": {
        ""build"": ""webpack --node-env=production --config build/webpack.config.js""
    }
}

the mode option respect the --node-env option if you don't set the mode option explicit using CLI options or in configuration(s), i.e. --node-env production set process.env.NODE_ENV and mode to production
