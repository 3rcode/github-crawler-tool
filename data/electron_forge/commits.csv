It makes the most sense to put this in the zip maker as the zip artifacts are what the macOS auto updater uses to update. This is part 1 of a multi-part series of PRs to forge + update-electron-app + forge-docs to make the story for ""I use forge, I want to update my app from static storage like S3"" incredibly easy to tell.

100,"fix(packager): ""packaging application"" log never stops when building for multiple architectures (#3006)"," Fix ""packaging application"" log never stopping when building for multiple architectures  There's some kinda complex race condition ish behaviour in the current way the packagerSpinner is handled. At the moment there's one variable for all architectures, that gets created in one of the later afterCopyHooks, and dismissed both in the first hook, and at the end of all the hooks. This would work if architectures where built for sequentially, but, at least on my system, these builds happen in parallel. Meaning one of the architectures packageSpinners overwrites the other, before the first is dismissed. At the end of the build the second packageSpinner has success fired on it, while the first continues to spin, preventing the process from exiting. The solution in this commit is far less than ideal. Constraints:  - Without access to the list of architectures (the function to generate that list is not exported from electron-packer) we don't even know how many architectures we're building for.  - This one is a little self-imposed, and maybe not a constraint for the project, but the code aims not to change any public facing apis. So we need to have one spinner we can pass to the postPackage hook. https://www.electronforge.io/configuration#postpackage Given these constraints the solution in this commit has one initial prepare / package spinner. AS well as prepare / package spinners per architecture. One downside is if the afterCopyHooks are executed one architecture at a time, instead of parallelized by architecture, the overarching prepareSpinner could be ended early, (though architecture specific prepare spinners would still be accurate).   Simplify Package spinners, removing prepackage & making package smarter.   build: update electron-packager   Co-authored-by: Samuel Attard link"

2612,Fix zip maker when cross-compiling,"The zip maker needs to know the target platform when cross-compiling, rather than just using the host platform. This involved changing the maker interface, so it now takes an options hash to make interface changes like this easier in the future with respect to compatibility. NOTE: This changes the maker interface, and will require any makers outside this repository to update their signatures."
2613,Update makers' supportedPlatforms,"When no os is specified in package.json, we should assume it works on all platforms...except some packages omit the os entry when they probably shouldn't, so comment and hard-code their supported platforms."

2666,feat(starter): automatically wipe the ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE variable unless specified,
2667,feat(generic): Support setting the Electron app path in start(),"The start command allows the caller to specify the directory for the Electron forge project, and then assumes that its main module is the Electron application. However, some projects may contain multiple Electron applications, or may want to specify an html file or a URL as the Electron application (see https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/cf694ef32b78f0904219c6c8ba554d3d5cbea037/default_app/main.js#L338). So, this adds an optional 'appPath' API option (and corresponding '-p'/'--app-path' CLI option) that is the path to the Electron application relative to the electron forge project (the 'dir' option). This also fixes the start command-line options parsing, which was passing all arguments through to the Electron application instead of parsing out the start command options."
