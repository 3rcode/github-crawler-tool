8,"What's Changed
Breaking changes
Forge has spent a considerable time in beta development; this is a list of breaking changes made in recent betas (>= 6.0.0-beta.65), so that users who have been using the later beta versions in their apps can more easily transition to the stable release.
A complete list of changes and commits can be found below.
Config: Changed plugins syntax (#2963)
The plugins array now takes objects containing an object with properties name and config, rather than tuples containing the plugin name and config.
This aligns the syntax for this configuration with the publishers and makers arrays.
diff
{
  plugins: [
-      [
-        '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
-        { /* ... */ }
-      ]
+
+      {
+        name: '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
+        config: { /* ... */ }
+      }
 ]
}
Config: Prefer forge.config.js for new Forge projects (#2991) (#2995)
We have changed the electron-forge init and electron-forge import commands to create a JavaScript config file rather than a section in package.json. This is to better
support dynamic build logic that isn't possible with the JSON format. Forge now has better support for alternate configuration syntaxes via rechoir.
This is a breaking change for any existing third-party templates and plugins:
- The internal signature of Plugin.getHook(name) has changed to Plugin.getHooks().name.
- Templates that mutated the Forge config within package.json will need to instantiate their own forge.config.js or forge.config.ts
Config: Renamed Electron Rebuild config (#2963)
For consistency with the packagerConfig option for electron-packager, the field to configure @electron/rebuild has now been shortened to rebuildConfig.
diff
{
-  electronRebuildConfig: { /* ... */ }
+  rebuildConfig: { /* ... */ }
}
Config: Renamed ElectronRebuildConfig (#2963)
Removed @electron-forge/template-typescript template (#2948)
This has been removed in favor of the [Webpack + TypeScript Template]. 
Maker: Upgraded Maker Wix dependency to electron-wix-msi@5.0.0 (3008))
This upgrade includes a rename from appIconPath to icon in the config (#153). This aligns WiX MSI's icon config with the other makers.
Build: Upgraded required Node.js to 14 LTS (#2921)
Package: Upgraded package dependency to electron-packager@17 (#2978)
The upgrade to Electron Packager 17 introduces the shiny new @electron/osx-sign package for macOS code signing. It's a rewrite of the old electron-osx-sign tool with more sensible defaults.
To migrate, we recommend seeing if the default packagerConfig.osxSign options work for you and tweaking the default entitlements to your needs. Otherwise, see the @electron/osx-sign MIGRATION.md doc for a 1:1 conversion from the old config options to the new ones.
Command: Removed lint command (#2964)
Command: Removed install command (#2958)

Full Changelog: https://github.com/electron/forge/compare/v5.1.1...v6.0.0","What's Changed
Breaking changes
Forge has spent a considerable time in beta development; this is a list of breaking changes made in recent betas (>= 6.0.0-beta.65), so that users who have been using the later beta versions in their apps can more easily transition to the stable release.
A complete list of changes and commits can be found below.
Config: Changed plugins syntax (#2963)
The plugins array now takes objects containing an object with properties name and config, rather than tuples containing the plugin name and config.
This aligns the syntax for this configuration with the publishers and makers arrays.
diff
{
  plugins: [
-      [
-        '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
-        { / ... / }
-      ]
+
+      {
+        name: '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
+        config: { / ... / }
+      }
 ]
}
Config: Prefer forge.config.js for new Forge projects (#2991) (#2995)
We have changed the electron-forge init and electron-forge import commands to create a JavaScript config file rather than a section in package.json. This is to better
support dynamic build logic that isn't possible with the JSON format. Forge now has better support for alternate configuration syntaxes via rechoir.
This is a breaking change for any existing third-party templates and plugins:
- The internal signature of Plugin.getHook(name) has changed to Plugin.getHooks().name.
- Templates that mutated the Forge config within package.json will need to instantiate their own forge.config.js or forge.config.ts
Config: Renamed Electron Rebuild config (#2963)
For consistency with the packagerConfig option for electron-packager, the field to configure @electron/rebuild has now been shortened to rebuildConfig.
diff
{
-  electronRebuildConfig: { / ... / }
+  rebuildConfig: { / ... / }
}
Config: Renamed ElectronRebuildConfig (#2963)
Removed @electron-forge/template-typescript template (#2948)
This has been removed in favor of the [Webpack + TypeScript Template]. 
Maker: Upgraded Maker Wix dependency to electron-wix-msi@5.0.0 (3008))
This upgrade includes a rename from appIconPath to icon in the config (#153). This aligns WiX MSI's icon config with the other makers.
Build: Upgraded required Node.js to 14 LTS (#2921)
Package: Upgraded package dependency to electron-packager@17 (#2978)
The upgrade to Electron Packager 17 introduces the shiny new @electron/osx-sign package for macOS code signing. It's a rewrite of the old electron-osx-sign tool with more sensible defaults.
To migrate, we recommend seeing if the default packagerConfig.osxSign options work for you and tweaking the default entitlements to your needs. Otherwise, see the @electron/osx-sign MIGRATION.md doc for a 1:1 conversion from the old config options to the new ones.
Command: Removed lint command (#2964)
Command: Removed install command (#2958)

Breaking Changes
Forge v6.0.0-beta.68 introduces a few breaking changes to the Forge config.
Renamed Electron Rebuild config (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/pull/2963)
For consistency with the packagerConfig option for electron-packager, the field to configure electron-rebuild has now been shortened to rebuildConfig.
diff
{
-  electronRebuildConfig: { /* ... */ }
+  rebuildConfig: { /* ... */ }
}
Changed plugin configuration syntax (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/pull/2963)
The plugins array now takes objects containing an object with properties name and config, rather than tuples containing the plugin name and config.
This aligns the syntax for this configuration with the publishers and makers arrays.
diff
{
  plugins: [
-      [
-        '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
-        { /* ... */ }
-      ]
+
+      {
+        name: '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',
+        config: { /* ... */ }
+      }
 ]
}
Upgraded Package dependency to electron-packager@17 (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/pull/2978)
The upgrade to Electron Packager 17 introduces the shiny new @electron/osx-sign package for macOS code signing. It's a rewrite of the old electron-osx-sign tool with more sensible defaults.
To migrate, we recommend seeing if the default packagerConfig.osxSign options work for you and tweaking the default entitlements to your needs. Otherwise, see the @electron/osx-sign MIGRATION.md doc for a 1:1 conversion from the old config options to the new ones.

Migration Notes
Due to the new devContentSecurityPolicy, existing projects using Webpack may have to specify a CSP in development.
Existing projects using Webpack and nodeIntegration: true will have to also set nodeIntegration in the Webpack plugin config.
Existing projects using Webpack should replace @marshallofsound/webpack-asset-relocator-loader with @vercel/webpack-asset-relocator-loader."
