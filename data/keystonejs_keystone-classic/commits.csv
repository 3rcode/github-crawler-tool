336,Fix: model with required field that defaults to 0 can't be saved,Number.prototype.validateRequiredInput() merely checked if the getter for the field returned a truthy value. That fails if the default happens to be zero (which is a falsy value). The fix is to simply check if the return value is a number.

After some digging I found that uglifyjs compresses the typeof checks into the following format ""undefined""==typeof x which triggers a syntax error after passing through another minification process when deployed. A way to prevent this from happening is to allow semicolons in the uglifyjs command. Also needed to add the 'aphrodite/no-important' to the required packages for the Admin UI."

665,Exception with the JSON download & Fix,"Hi! Firstly can I say going through this codebase is a joy, I've known of keystone for awhile and tinkered with it in my spare time - its great to see how its evolved.  I found that this was throwing an exception when you click to download data as json. you can reproduce the bug at http://demo.keystonejs.com/keystone/posts download > json > download the server hangs with no response...  this fixes the issue, the flow is now similar with the CSV download. Which is where I pinched the 'list-to-array' require from. Its now fixed for this scenario. A few other points I have noted for discussion: - Do we also want it to be a json file download or json response? - we should probably also have an exception handler to return 500 from express for anything else? - I notice the user can enter ""password"" into the query string and reveal the hash, is this expected behaviour? I assume its safe under a users logged in session - I've noticed the require for 'baby-parse' is within the handler? do we want to hang the server on request? https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/admin/server/api/list/download.js#L9 If you're after any more help on issues or more info on this bug, I'd be more than happy to help!  Thanks  Mike Description of changes I've added the missing check for ""is a string"" if so then convert to an array which done by the third-party dependency 'list-to-array'. Testing a note: I got this selenium error before I made changes on the branch, this has actually prevented me from getting the selenium tests to pass.  module"

Addresses the (hopefully?) unusual case where module is enabled for a list but the collection has an existing text index that isn't described by the list. In this scenario, ensureTextIndex() will log the issue to stderr and the text search will use the existing index. This might produce unexpected search behaviour.. or might be exactly what the app builder intended; we don't know.",

3772,Removing console.log calls from the create API,"These shouldn’t be here, they don’t respect the keystone logger settings"
3773,Responding with all errors from list.updateItem,Also returns the new standard API error format for pass-through implementation in endpoints

4062,Refactor Pagination to allow optional expressions,"Added options.optionalExpression value to model.find. This allows an additional object to be passed to the find method. This is useful for example, when performing a $text search, and you want to sort by score. In this case, your filter would be: { $text: { $search: term } } and optionalExpression would be: { score: { $meta: 'textScore' } }. Added an additional query that does not include the optionalExpression object to perform the count of objects. This allows the count to be performed without additional meta data from the optionalExpression interfering."

6075,Override shouldCollapse in ArrayField.js,This lets module do the right thing for any *Array fields. Using the default module implementation in Field.js doesn't work when the value is an array. Fixes #1111
6076,Example says .set() but code says .options(),So I made the example match the code.
6077,Allow wysiwyg option to be an object of options,"By making this change it allows you to specify editor config options on a per-field basis. Since even an empty object is truthy none of the code around checking for field validity needs to change and we can simply pass the value through. The React component does have to do an module check now but it's a small change. Had to rework the module function to take the module object option into account (via module) and then changed references to the merged result throughout the function. Very little else actually needed to change though. I've tested against global options, fields wit no options, and fields with customized options all in the same model to try and rule out any pass-by-reference issues and don't see anything. If someone can think of a sufficiently-complicated test-case I could use that this breaks on I'd love to see it. This change has me a bit paranoid. Fixes #525"

6085,Override shouldCollapse on relationship fields,"Because a many relationship field doesn't have a simple value (it's an array) the default module in module returns a bogus value. I have overriden module in module so that it now can fork its response based on a single/many relationship. The single relationship path is the same, while a many relationship will use the module of value instead. Also fixed a few JSHint errors in generally non-scary ways (add a module on line 79, some semicolons)."

6114,Markdown respects height config,"Told markdown it should respect the module option that was already being managed on the server but not sent to the client. Then passed it through to the markdown editor so it'd respect it. Also taught markdown fields how not to be wysiwyg (though they default to wysiwyg, is that the right behavior? It's the backwards-compatible behavior at least). Doing this required slightly more work than a usual option to maintain backcompat but isn't super-scary or anything. Height is also maintained when wysiwyg is disabled. Also sending module down to the client. It was in the docs but as far as I can tell it wasn't plumbed through in the React component for markdown fields. Only supporting module for now since that is all that is in the docs."
6115,Merge pull request #1145 from tivac/markdown-controls-disappearing,Fix markdown fields losing controls when hidden
6116,Fix markdown fields losing controls when hidden,"Because of how controls are rendered when hidden (shortcutted by returning null) if you hide a markdown input & reshow it doesn't get the markdown editor applied to it again. Prior to this commit that was only happening in module, which happens the first time a component is rendered. This change abstracts out the markdown editor instantiation a bit so that it's easy to add it to the module lifecycle method as well. Now the component will re-attach the textarea when a markdown field is reshown after being hidden. This also breaks out the module as it wasn't necessary to be defined every time module executed. It also moves the functionality of module inline to markdown editor instantiation as it's no longer complicated enough to justify its own function."
6117,Merge pull request #1144 from tivac/collapsed-markdown,Markdown fields don't honor collapse config
6118,Override shouldCollapse for Markdown fields,Since the module for a markdown field is an object the default module check in module returns the wrong value. This provides an overridden implementation that comprehends the object version of module and uses the module field as the conditional.

To address this issue createItems errors need to be logged very early on within its own module and not back in the updates module where the process.exit() happens since it has higher priority than logging and thus most times preempts any logging that may still be queued up.  The code arrangement provided by this PR ensures the best consistent results. With the updated changes, if a validation or other error or occurs createItems will log an error.  For example: module With the updated changes, if a createItems error occurs the updates module will log a final error.  For example: module If createItems succeeds then you get the usual.

Exposes session store, cookie parser, and session key which allows session.socket.io to match the current session with the socket.io connection in that session. 2. Add a switch to enable the turning off of the view engine cache in development mode. This helps when debugging other engines like swig. Keystone session.socket.io example: keystone.start( {   onHttpServerCreated: function()   {     keystone.app.io = require('socket.io').listen(keystone.httpServer);     keystone.app.sessionsocketio = new require('session.socket.io')(keystone.app.io, keystone.app.sessionOpts.store, keystone.app.sessionOpts.cookieParser, keystone.app.sessionOpts.key);     keystone.app.sessionsocketio.on('connection', function (err, socket, session) {       socket.emit('alert', { message: 'socket.io is connected to session: ' + session });     });   } }); Socket.io v1.x HTML example:     var socket = io('http://localhost');   socket.on('alert', function (data) {     console.log(data.message);   });"

It cancels the deletion, but no message was prompt (flash or console)."
