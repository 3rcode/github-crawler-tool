665,Exception with the JSON download & Fix,"Hi! Firstly can I say going through this codebase is a joy, I've known of keystone for awhile and tinkered with it in my spare time - its great to see how its evolved.  I found that this was throwing an exception when you click to download data as json. you can reproduce the bug at http://demo.keystonejs.com/keystone/posts download > json > download the server hangs with no response...  this fixes the issue, the flow is now similar with the CSV download. Which is where I pinched the 'list-to-array' require from. Its now fixed for this scenario. A few other points I have noted for discussion: - Do we also want it to be a json file download or json response? - we should probably also have an exception handler to return 500 from express for anything else? - I notice the user can enter ""password"" into the query string and reveal the hash, is this expected behaviour? I assume its safe under a users logged in session - I've noticed the require for 'baby-parse' is within the handler? do we want to hang the server on request? https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/admin/server/api/list/download.js#L9 If you're after any more help on issues or more info on this bug, I'd be more than happy to help!

Thanks  Mike Description of changes I've added the missing check for ""is a string"" if so then convert to an array which done by the third-party dependency 'list-to-array'. Testing a note: I got this selenium error before I made changes on the branch, this has actually prevented me from getting the selenium tests to pass.  Timed out while waiting for element <.primary-navbar [data-section-label=""octicon-sign-out""]> to be present for 60000 milliseconds.  - expected ""visible"" but got: ""not found""     at Object.after (/Users/MikeJames/projects/keystone-play/keystone/test/e2e/adminUI/tests/group006Fields/commonFieldTestUtils.js:13:22)"

6077,Allow wysiwyg option to be an object of options,"By making this change it allows you to specify editor config options on a per-field basis. Since even an empty object is truthy none of the code around checking for field validity needs to change and we can simply pass the value through. The React component does have to do an _isObject check now but it's a small change. Had to rework the getOptions function to take the wysiwyg object option into account (via _.defaults) and then changed references to the merged result throughout the function. Very little else actually needed to change though. I've tested against global options, fields wit no options, and fields with customized options all in the same model to try and rule out any pass-by-reference issues and don't see anything. If someone can think of a sufficiently-complicated test-case I could use that this breaks on I'd love to see it. This change has me a bit paranoid.

Prior to this commit that was only happening in componentDidMount, which happens the first time a component is rendered. This change abstracts out the markdown editor instantiation a bit so that it's easy to add it to the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method as well. Now the component will re-attach the textarea when a markdown field is reshown after being hidden. This also breaks out the headingCallback() as it wasn't necessary to be defined every time buttonsToAdd() executed.
