Fix attempt for issue #3979,0.55223477,- Misc fixes and improvements #2994 (webteckie),"packages.js generates a Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string when minified, and fails to load the admin interface. After some digging I found that uglifyjs compresses the typeof checks into the following format ""undefined""==typeof x which triggers a syntax error after passing through another minification process when deployed. A way to prevent this from happening is to allow semicolons in the uglifyjs command. Also needed to add the 'aphrodite/no-important' to the required packages for the Admin UI.",0

Exception with the JSON download & Fix,0.35358813,- download/export of Markdown fields is empty if HTML doesn't exist #3001,"Hi! Firstly can I say going through this codebase is a joy, I've known of keystone for awhile and tinkered with it in my spare time - its great to see how its evolved.  I found that this was throwing an exception when you click to download data as json. you can reproduce the bug at http://demo.keystonejs.com/keystone/posts download > json > download the server hangs with no response...  this fixes the issue, the flow is now similar with the CSV download. Which is where I pinched the 'list-to-array' require from. Its now fixed for this scenario. A few other points I have noted for discussion: - Do we also want it to be a json file download or json response? - we should probably also have an exception handler to return 500 from express for anything else? - I notice the user can enter ""password"" into the query string and reveal the hash, is this expected behaviour? I assume its safe under a users logged in session - I've noticed the require for 'baby-parse' is within the handler? do we want to hang the server on request? https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/admin/server/api/list/download.js#L9 If you're after any more help on issues or more info on this bug, I'd be more than happy to help!  Thanks  Mike Description of changes I've added the missing check for ""is a string"" if so then convert to an array which done by the third-party dependency 'list-to-array'. Testing a note: I got this selenium error before I made changes on the branch, this has actually prevented me from getting the selenium tests to pass.  Timed out while waiting for element <.primary-navbar [data-section-label=""octicon-sign-out""]> to be present for 60000 milliseconds.  - expected ""visible"" but got: ""not found""     at Object.after (/Users/MikeJames/projects/keystone-play/keystone/test/e2e/adminUI/tests/group006Fields/commonFieldTestUtils.js:13:22)",0

Allow wysiwyg option to be an object of options,0.40667814,- WYSIWYG Editor doesn't refresh for dependsOn. (4.0.0-beta.3) #3551,"By making this change it allows you to specify editor config options on a per-field basis. Since even an empty object is truthy none of the code around checking for field validity needs to change and we can simply pass the value through. The React component does have to do an _isObject check now but it's a small change. Had to rework the getOptions function to take the wysiwyg object option into account (via _.defaults) and then changed references to the merged result throughout the function. Very little else actually needed to change though. I've tested against global options, fields wit no options, and fields with customized options all in the same model to try and rule out any pass-by-reference issues and don't see anything. If someone can think of a sufficiently-complicated test-case I could use that this breaks on I'd love to see it. This change has me a bit paranoid. Fixes #525",0

It's the backwards-compatible behavior at least). Doing this required slightly more work than a usual option to maintain backcompat but isn't super-scary or anything. Height is also maintained when wysiwyg is disabled. Also sending toolbarOptions down to the client. It was in the docs but as far as I can tell it wasn't plumbed through in the React component for markdown fields. Only supporting toolbarOptions.hiddenButtons for now since that is all that is in the docs.",0

Fix markdown fields losing controls when hidden,0.46844244,- [0.4] WYSIWYG editor breaks in Firefox if shown and hidden twice #2834,"Because of how controls are rendered when hidden (shortcutted by returning null) if you hide a markdown input & reshow it doesn't get the markdown editor applied to it again. Prior to this commit that was only happening in componentDidMount, which happens the first time a component is rendered. This change abstracts out the markdown editor instantiation a bit so that it's easy to add it to the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method as well. Now the component will re-attach the textarea when a markdown field is reshown after being hidden. This also breaks out the headingCallback() as it wasn't necessary to be defined every time buttonsToAdd() executed. It also moves the functionality of buttonsToAdd() inline to markdown editor instantiation as it's no longer complicated enough to justify its own function.",0

Log mongoose validation errors generated during createItems(improvement).,0.46364293," * Update mongoose from  4.9.2 to  4.13.14 (#4701, thanks @stennie)","At least, on windows keystone has issues generating mongoose validation errors when they happen during createItems.  To address this issue createItems errors need to be logged very early on within its own module and not back in the updates module where the process.exit() happens since it has higher priority than logging and thus most times preempts any logging that may still be queued up.  The code arrangement provided by this PR ensures the best consistent results. With the updated changes, if a validation or other error or occurs createItems will log an error.  For example: { [ValidationError: Validation failed]   message: 'Validation failed',   name: 'ValidationError',   errors:    { startTime:       { [ValidatorError: Path `startTime` is required.]         message: 'Path `startTime` is required.',         name: 'ValidatorError',         path: 'startTime',         type: 'required',         value: undefined } },   model: 'Event',   data:    { name: 'Test Booking 1',      status: 'pending',      endTime:       { _isAMomentObject: true,         _isUTC: false,         _pf: [Object],         _locale: [Object],         _d: Thu Jan 08 2015 21:29:37 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) },      __ref: 'Event_1',      __doc:       { endTime: Thu Jan 08 2015 21:29:37 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),         name: 'Test Booking 1',         type: 'none',         repeat: 'none',         status: 'pending',         guests: [],         allDay: false,         listName: 'Event',         _id: 54af3d139844182c0ff75cea } } } Trace: ValidationError: Path `startTime` is required.     at model.Document.invalidate (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\document.js:1021:32)     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\document.js:970:16     at validate (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\schematype.js:610:7)     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\schematype.js:627:9     at Array.forEach (native)     at SchemaDate.SchemaType.doValidate (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\schematype.js:614:19)     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\document.js:968:9     at process._tickCallback (node.js:419:13)     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\lib\core\createItems.js:295:13     at c:\avp\node_modules\async\lib\async.js:544:30     at c:\avp\node_modules\async\lib\async.js:151:21     at c:\avp\node_modules\async\lib\async.js:151:21     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\lib\core\createItems.js:120:7     at handleError (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\node_modules\hooks\hooks.js:92:18)     at _next (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\node_modules\hooks\hooks.js:34:22)     at fnWrapper (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\node_modules\hooks\hooks.js:159:8)     at complete (c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\document.js:986:5)     at c:\reDist\node_modules\keystone\node_modules\mongoose\lib\document.js:977:20  With the updated changes, if a createItems error occurs the updates module will log a final error.
