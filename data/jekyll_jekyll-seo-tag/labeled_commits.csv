The implementation has led to complications updating JSON-LD data in #151. Under Pareto principal we can reasonably assume this feature is not often used, and, as such, should be removed. The result of which simplifies template logic, offers a fallback experience by leverages Twitter's use of og:image in place of twitter:image (sees twitter card tag ref) and helps unblock #151. Users can no longer specify a separate twitter and Facebook image. If both a Facebook (Open Graph) and Twitter image are provided in the image object, the Facebook image will take precedence.",1
