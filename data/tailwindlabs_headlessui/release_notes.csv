Changes that might affect you
Migrating from DialogOverlay to DialogPanel
In previous versions of Headless UI, closing a dialog was handled by a click handler that lived on the DialogOverlay component, so as long as your overlay was rendered behind your panel, clicking outside the panel would close the dialog.
This created an issue with scrollable dialogs, because it became easy to accidentally position your overlay on top of the scrollbar, which made it impossible to click the scrollbar without closing the dialog. You also couldn't scroll the dialog when your mouse was hovering over the overlay — only when your mouse was hovering over the actual panel.
We've fixed this in Headless UI v1.6 by adding a dedicated DialogPanel component, and changing how ""click outside"" is handled. Now, if you're using a DialogPanel, the dialog is closed any time you click any element outside of it, rather than closing only when a DialogOverlay is explicitly clicked.
If you're using DialogOverlay and not using DialogPanel, everything will continue to work exactly as it did before (including the bug I described above) to preserve backwards compatibility, but we highly encourage you to migrate to using DialogPanel, and to stop using DialogOverlay, instead using a simple div element:
```diff
  <Dialog
    :open=""isOpen""
    @close=""closeModal""
    class=""fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center ...""









Payment successful
 ... 



```

Read through the updated Dialog documentation for more examples of using DialogPanel.
Multiple value support for Listbox and Combobox
If you have been using the insiders build for the new multiple value support for the Listbox and/or Combobox component, then you will have to add a new multiple prop to those components to tell the component that you are using multiple values. Previously this was automatically detected based on whether you were passing an array to the value prop or not.

Improve incorrect behaviour for nesting Dialog components (#560)


The Open/Closed state unlocks a feature where all our components can interact with each other. This means that you don't need to use the render prop function, and that you also don't need the static prop anymore for transitions. Here is an example in the docs that explains this: https://headlessui.dev/react/menu#transitions","Added

Also changes the API of Transition component.
We will now always render a div by default (unless you change this using the as={...} prop).
The render function prop doesn't expose a ref anymore.
Adds unmount prop to the Transition and Transition.Child components.


Add displayName to all contexts (#175)
Add disabled prop to Listbox itself, instead of the Listbox.Button (#229)

Upgrade Path
We changed the API of the Transition component to be more inline with the other API's of the various components. We now always render a div for the Transition and Transition.Child component. If you want to use a render function, then we still render a div. The render function also used do expose a ref prop, which is now not the case anymore.
You can still use the as prop to change the underlying div to another element or component.
```js
// From
<Transition
  show={true}
  enter=""..""
  enterFrom=""..""
  enterTo=""..""
  leave=""..""
