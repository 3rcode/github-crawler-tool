As of OpenJDK 11.0.16, OpenJDK detects container limits via cgroups v2.

The fix itself was provided by @geek of Joyent. I've also made the Tini architecture more explicit (since Tini now also supports ARM), so in case you decide to support additional architectures in the future, the fix should be more obvious. There isn't much functional difference between 0.9.0 (which you were using) and 0.13.1, but here are a few notable changes you might care about to some extent: Tini now supports a -l flag to show its license. This was useful   from a compliance perspective for some users (so considering you're   shipping Tini that might indirectly be useful to you!). Tini now supports a --version argument to show its version. This is   here mostly because it's a little more intuitive than what was there   before (you'd have to use -h to see the version). Tini now supports a TINI_VERBOSITY environment variable (should be   an int), which can be convenient for debugging when Tini is used as an   ENTRYPOINT (avoids the need to alter the entrypoint to configure   it). Tini now uses more specific exit codes when it fails to fork (e.g.   because the binary you're looking for doesn't exist, etc.). Thanks for using Tini in this image!",0
