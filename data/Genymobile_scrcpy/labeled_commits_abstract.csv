Use delay buffer as a frame source/sink,0.5709813, - Reduce latency by 1 frame (#646),"The components needing delayed frames (sc_screen and sc_v4l2_sink) managed a sc_video_buffer instance, which itself embedded a sc_frame_buffer instance (to keep only the most recent frame). In theory, these components should not be aware of delaying: they should just receive AVFrames later, and only handle a sc_frame_buffer. Therefore, refactor sc_delay_buffer as a frame source (it consumes) frames) and a frame sink (it produces frames, after some delay), and plug an instance in the pipeline only when a delay is requested.

Force mouse source when --forward-all-clicks,0.7410605," - Fix click behavior when --forward-all-clicks is set (#3568, #3579)","Right click and middle click require the source device to be a mouse, not a touchscreen. Therefore, the source device was changed only when a button other than the primary button was pressed (see adc547fa6e8e6167cd9633a97d98de6665b8c23a). However, this led to inconsistencies between the ACTION_DOWN when a secondary button is pressed (with a mouse as source device) and the matching ACTION_UP when the secondary button is released (with a touchscreen as source device, because then there is no button pressed). To avoid the problem in all cases, force a mouse as source device when --forward-all-clicks is set. Concretely, for mouse events in --forward-all-clicks mode:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_MOUSE;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_MOUSE; Otherwise (when --forward-all-clicks is unset, or for real touch events), finger events are injected:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_FINGER.

Wait SET_CLIPBOARD ack before Ctrl+v via HID,0.8091043, - Ensure clipboard synchronization is performed before injecting Ctrl+v via HID keyboard (#2814),"To allow seamless copy-paste, on Ctrl+v, a SET_CLIPBOARD request is performed before injecting Ctrl+v. But when HID keyboard is enabled, the Ctrl+v injection is not sent on the same channel as the clipboard request, so they are not serialized, and may occur in any order. If Ctrl+v happens to be injected before the new clipboard content is set, then the old content is pasted instead, which is incorrect. To minimize the probability of occurrence of the wrong order, a delay of 2 milliseconds was added before injecting Ctrl+v. Then 5ms. But even with 5ms, the wrong behavior sometimes happens. To handle it properly, add an acknowledgement mechanism, so that Ctrl+v is injected over AOA only after the SET_CLIPBOARD request has been performed and acknowledged by the server.

Replace SDL_net by custom implementation,0.47970584, - Downgrade SDL to 2.0.8 in Windows releases (#425),"SDL_net is not very suitable for scrcpy. For example, SDLNet_TCP_Accept() is non-blocking, so we have to wrap it by calling many SDL_Net-specific functions to make it blocking. But above all, SDLNet_TCP_Open() is a server socket only when no IP is provided; otherwise, it's a client socket. Therefore, it is not possible to create a server socket bound to localhost, so it accepts connections from anywhere. This is a problem for scrcpy, because on start, the application listens for nearly 1 second until it accepts the first connection, supposedly from the device. If someone on the local network manages to connect to the server socket first, then they can stream arbitrary H.264 video.

As a consequence, step 3 also takes ~800ms on the client. Once complete, the client initializes SDL, which takes ~500ms. These two expensive actions are executed sequentially:                  HOST              DEVICE listen on port        |                  | push/start the server |----------------->|| app_process loads the jar accept the connection .   ^              ||                       .   |              ||                       .   | WASTE        ||                       .   |  OF          ||                       .   | TIME         ||                       .   |              ||                       .   |              ||                       .   v              X execution of our java main connection accepted   |<-----------------| connect to the host init SDL             ||                  |                      || ,----------------| send frames                      || |,---------------|                      || ||,--------------|                      || |||,-------------|                      || ||||,------------| init window/renderer  | |||||,-----------| display frames        |<++++++-----------| (many frames skipped) The rationale for step 3 occuring before step 5 is that initializing SDL replaces the SIGTERM handler to receive the event in the event loop, so pressing Ctrl+C during step 5 would not work (since it blocks the event loop).

Encode video using MediaCodec API,0.60432506, - Add --codec-options to pass MediaFormat options directly (#1325),"Replace screenrecord execution by manual screen encoding using the MediaCodec API. The ""screenrecord"" solution had several drawbacks:  - screenrecord output is buffered, so tiny frames may not be accessible    immediately;  - it did not output a frame until the surface changed, leading to a    black screen on start;  - it is limited to 3 minutes recording, so it needed to be restarted;  - screenrecord added black borders in the video when the requested    dimensions did not preserve aspect-ratio exactly (sometimes    unavoidable since video dimensions must be multiple of 8);  - rotation handling was hacky (killing the process and starting a new    one). Handling the encoding manually allows to solve all these problems.",0

Handle resized video stream,0.51155037,Auto-downscale on MediaCodec error,"Accept a parameter to limit the video size. For instance, with ""-m 960"", the great side of the video will be scaled down to 960 (if necessary), while the other side will be scaled down so that the aspect ratio is preserved. Both dimensions must be a multiple of 8, so black bands might be added, and the mouse positions must be computed accordingly.",0
Do not use device as a singleton,0.3992858, - Initialize Application object (fix crashes on some devices) (#940),"The device instance should be able to store a state (e.g. the maximum size requested by the user), so it should not be a singleton.",0

Scale mouse events,0.58886164," - Correctly handle mouse events outside device screen (#353, #357)","The video screen size on the client may differ from the real device screen size (e.g. the video stream may be scaled down). As a consequence, mouse events must be scaled to match the real device coordinates. For this purpose, make the client send the video screen size along with the absolute pointer location, and the server scale the location to match the real device size before injecting mouse events.",0
Keep screen info in cache,0.466997,"However, the physical screen was not automatically restored on disconnection, which was annoying. Now it is.","Currently, we only use screen information (width, height, rotation) once at initialization, to send the device size to the client.
