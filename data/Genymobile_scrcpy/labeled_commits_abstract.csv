In theory, these components should not be aware of delaying: they should just receive AVFrames later, and only handle a sc_frame_buffer. Therefore, refactor sc_delay_buffer as a frame source (it consumes) frames) and a frame sink (it produces frames, after some delay), and plug an instance in the pipeline only when a delay is requested.

However, this led to inconsistencies between the ACTION_DOWN when a secondary button is pressed (with a mouse as source device) and the matching ACTION_UP when the secondary button is released (with a touchscreen as source device, because then there is no button pressed). To avoid the problem in all cases, force a mouse as source device when --forward-all-clicks is set. Concretely, for mouse events in --forward-all-clicks mode:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_MOUSE;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_MOUSE; Otherwise (when --forward-all-clicks is unset, or for real touch events), finger events are injected:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_FINGER.

If Ctrl+v happens to be injected before the new clipboard content is set, then the old content is pasted instead, which is incorrect. To minimize the probability of occurrence of the wrong order, a delay of 2 milliseconds was added before injecting Ctrl+v. Then 5ms. But even with 5ms, the wrong behavior sometimes happens. To handle it properly, add an acknowledgement mechanism, so that Ctrl+v is injected over AOA only after the SET_CLIPBOARD request has been performed and acknowledged by the server.
