69,Remove unused mutex field in decoder,0.47550923,Remove deprecated short options,"The components needing delayed frames (sc_screen and sc_v4l2_sink) managed a sc_video_buffer instance, which itself embedded a sc_frame_buffer instance (to keep only the most recent frame). In theory, these components should not be aware of delaying: they should just receive AVFrames later, and only handle a sc_frame_buffer. Therefore, refactor sc_delay_buffer as a frame source (it consumes) frames) and a frame sink (it produces frames, after some delay), and plug an instance in the pipeline only when a delay is requested.

Therefore, the source device was changed only when a button other than the primary button was pressed (see adc547fa6e8e6167cd9633a97d98de6665b8c23a). However, this led to inconsistencies between the ACTION_DOWN when a secondary button is pressed (with a mouse as source device) and the matching ACTION_UP when the secondary button is released (with a touchscreen as source device, because then there is no button pressed). To avoid the problem in all cases, force a mouse as source device when --forward-all-clicks is set. Concretely, for mouse events in --forward-all-clicks mode:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_MOUSE;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_MOUSE; Otherwise (when --forward-all-clicks is unset, or for real touch events), finger events are injected:  - device source is set to InputDevice.SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN;  - motion event toolType is set to MotionEvent.TOOL_TYPE_FINGER.

If Ctrl+v happens to be injected before the new clipboard content is set, then the old content is pasted instead, which is incorrect. To minimize the probability of occurrence of the wrong order, a delay of 2 milliseconds was added before injecting Ctrl+v. Then 5ms. But even with 5ms, the wrong behavior sometimes happens. To handle it properly, add an acknowledgement mechanism, so that Ctrl+v is injected over AOA only after the SET_CLIPBOARD request has been performed and acknowledged by the server.

867,Add scrcpy icon to README,0.78767884, - Add icon to scrcpy.exe (#2815),"To minimize latency (at the cost of jitter), scrcpy always displays a frame as soon as it available, without waiting. However, when recording (--record), it still writes the captured timestamps to the output file, so that the recorded file can be played correctly without jitter. Some real-time use cases might benefit from adding a small latency to compensate for jitter too. For example, few tens of seconds of latency for live-streaming are not important, but jitter is noticeable. Therefore, implement a buffering mechanism (disabled by default) to add a configurable latency delay. PR #2417 https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/2417",1

But to remove ifdefs and to allow users to test this flag easily, it had finally been exposed by commit ebccb9f6cc111e8acfbe10d656cac5c1f1b744a0. In practice, it turned out to be useless: it had no practical impact, and it did not solve or mitigate any performance issues causing frame skipping. But that added some complexity to the codebase: it required an additional condition variable, and made video buffer calls possibly blocking, which in turn required code to interrupt it on exit.

Commit 26529d377fe8aae2fd1ffa91405aa801a0ce8a57 used -1 as a workaround to avoid a NPE on a specific Android TV device. But this is a bug in the device system, which wrongly assumes that input device may not be null. A similar issue was present in Flutter, but it is now fixed:  - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30665  - https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/7986 On the other hand, using an id of -1 for touchscreen events (which is invalid) causes issues for some apps: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/2125#issuecomment-790535792 Therefore, use a device id of 0.

See getInputDeviceId(): https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/master/cmds/input/src/com/android/commands/input/Input.java But it seems better to indicate that the event didn't come from a physical device, and it would not solve #962 anyway, because an Android TV has no touchscreen.

Keep the ""adb reverse"" mode as the default because it does not involve connection retries: when using ""adb forward"", the client must try to connect successively until the server listens. Due to the tunnel, every connect() will succeed, so the client must attempt to read() to detect a connection failure.

Typically, if you added the scrcpy directory in your PATH to call scrcpy from anywhere, the current directory could be anything.

The input XPM is considered safe (it's in our source repo), so do not check XPM format errors. This implies that read_xpm() is not safe to call on any unsafe input.
