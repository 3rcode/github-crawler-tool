1,Source borderWidth options from config,0.6695764,Support border-opacity utilities alongside default border utility (#4277),"run PostCSS relative to test file The PostCSS from was always set to the tests/util/run file with the current test name as a query param to make it unique. However, that results in issues with relative file paths because they are now relative to this file instead of the actual test file. Luckily, expect.getState() exposes the testPath value that points to the current test file itself. add built in @import processing additional features such that you can use @tailwind and @config   directives before the @import at rule which isn't normally allowed.   However ""@tailwind"" in a way is an @import and @config in a way is   a @charset which can be used before the @import at rule. drop partial normalizeTailwindDirectives when in the Oxide engine This will now be handled by Tailwind from a higher level, so the core doesn't have to worry about normalizing this anymore since it will always be normalized right now. add handleImportAtRules to CLI update changelog scope import processing to the oxide engine update Changelog use direct comparison We don't need the startsWith check anymore because the contents of the comment will be the actual value we expect.",0

5,Add peer variant (#4556),0.68209314,JIT: Don't add multiple ~ when stacking peer-* variants (#4757),"resolve all existing content paths pin @napi-rs/cli WIP: Log all resolved content files/globs only filter out raw changed content in non-auto mode skip parseCandidateFiles cache in auto mode improve algorithm of detecting content paths Files in the root should be listed statically instead of using globs. Files and folders in special known direct child folders should be    listed statically instead of using globs (e.g.: public). This is    because these special folders are often used to store generated AND    source files at the same time. Using globs could trigger infinite    loops because we are watching and acting upon dist files. All file extensions found in the project, should be used in the globs    in addition to a known set of extensions. Direct folders seen from the root, can use the glob syntax    /src/*/.{...known-extensions} inline wanted-extensions Not 100% convinced yet, but seems cleaner so far. ensure writing an file also makes the parent folder(s) add integration tests for the auto content feature add pnpm and bun lock files Revert ""inline wanted-extensions"" This reverts commit 879c1248524e84216125f4a24e0160b40736333a. sort binary-extensions and add lockb sort + add lock to ignored extensions drop yarn.lock, because lock extensions are already covered group template extensions This will make it a bit easier to organize in the future. drop empty lines and commented lines from template-extensions skip the config path when resolving template files The config file will automatically trigger a rebuild when this file is changed. However, this should not be part of the template files because that could cause additional css that's not being used. make auto content the default in the oxide engine In the oxide engine, the default content: [] will be dropped from   the default configuration (config.simple.js, config.full.js). If you have content: [] or content: { files: [] } then the auto   content feature won't be active. However if those arrays are empty a   warning will still be shown. Adding files/globs or dropping the   content section completely will enable auto content. only test the auto content integration test in the oxide engine set content.files to auto instead of using auto: boolean This way we don't run into the issue where the config.content.files is set and the config.content.auto is set to true. drop log ensure we validate the config in the CLI show experimental warning for automatic content detection use cached version of the getCandidateFiles instead of bypassing it use is_empty() shorthand Thanks, Clippy! add test to ensure nested ignored folders are not scanned add tempfile for tests add auto content tests in Rust refactor auto content detection This will also make sure that if we have (deeply) nested ignored folders, then we won't use deeply nested globs (/.{js,html}) for the parent(s) of the nested ignored folders but instead use a shallow glob for each directory (/*.{js,html}). Then each sibling directory of the parent can use deeply nested globs again except for the direct parent. use consistent comments ensure ignored static listed files are not present improve performance by ~30x On a big test project this goes from ~6s to ~200ms improve performance by ~5x We started with a ~6s duration Then in the previous commit, we improved it by ~30x and it went down to ~200ms Now with this change, it takes about ~40ms. That's another ~5x improvement. Or in total a ~150x improvement. ensure nested folders in public/ are also explicitly listed add shortcut for normalizing files This is only called once so won't do anything to the main performance of Tailwind CSS. But always nice to make small performance improvements! run Rust tests in CI fix lint warnings update changelog Update CHANGELOG.md Co-authored-by: Robin Malfait malfait.robin@gmail.com",0

We are not interested in the dependencies that are listed in your package.json and thus in your node_modules folder. We made the assumption that your imports have at least 3 characters. This sort of makes sense because there will be a ., then the OS separator like / and than a file name. E.g.: ./a is the minimal amount of characters. This makes sense for import statements, but in the case of require, it is totally valid to write require('.'). This will require the current index.{js,ts,mjs,cjs,...} in the current directory.

Right now the tests are setup in a way that both the generated css and expected css are run through lightningcss to make sure that the output is concistent for the stable and oxide engines. But this also means that the expected output could be larger (aka not optimized) and still matches (after it runs through lightningcss). By replacing this with the more optimal output we achieve a few things: This better reflects reality since we will be using lightningcss. This gets rid of unnecessary css. Removed code!,0

WIP Defer to existing CLI for Oxide Include new compiled typescript stuff when publishing Move TS to ./src/oxide Update scripts Clean up tests for TS copy cli to oxide/cli make CLI files TypeScript files drop --postcss flag setup lightningcss Remove autoprefixer and cssnano from oxide CLI cleanup Rust code a little bit Drop commented out code Drop 500 fixture templates sort test output re-add prepublishOnly script bump SWC dependencies in package-lock.json pin @swc dependencies ensure to install and build oxide update all GitHub Workflows to reflect Oxide required changes sort content-resolution integration tests add Release Insiders ‚Äî Oxide setup turbo repo + remote caching use npx to invoke turbo setup unique/proper package names for integration tests add missing isomorphic-fetch dependency setup integration tests to use turborepo scope tailwind tasks to root workspace re-enable node_modules cache for integration tests re-enable node_modules cache for main CI workflow split cache for main and oxide node_modules fix indent split install dependencies so that they can be cached individually improve GitHub actions caching use correct path for oxide node_modules (crates/node) ensure that cargo install always succeeds cargo install X, on CI will fail if it already exists. figure out integration tests with turbo tmp: use npm instead of turbo disable fail-fast This will allow us to run integration tests so that it still caches the succesful ones. YAML OH YAML, Y U WHITESPACE SENSITIVE copy the oxide-ci workflow to release-oxide make oxide-ci a normal CI workflow Without publishing try to cache cargo and node_modules for the oxide build configure turbo to run scripts in the root explicitly skip failing test for the Oxide version run oxide tests in CI only use build script for root package sync package-lock.json do not cache node_modules for each individual integration look for hoisted .bin use turbo for caching build tailwind css in integration tests Robin... try to use the local binary first skip installing integration test dependencies Should already be installed due to workspace usage Robin... drop output.clean explicitly add mini-css-extract-plugin drop oxide-ci, this is tested by proxy ensure oxide build is used in integration tests This will ensure the @tailwindcss/oxide dependency is available (whether we use it or not). setup Oxide shim in insiders release add browserslist dependency use install:all script name Just using install as a script name will be called when running npm install. Now that we marked the repo as a workspace, npm install will run install in all workspaces which is... not ideal. tmp: enable insiders release in PRs Just to check if everything works before merging. Can be removed once tested. don't cache node_modules? I feel there is some catch 22 going on here. We require npm install to build the oxide/crates/node version. But we also require oxide/crates/node for the npm install becaus of the dependency: ""@tailwindcss/oxide"": ""file:oxide/creates/node"" try to use oxide/crates/node as part of the workspace let's think about this Let's try and cache the node_modules and share as much as possible. However, some scripts still need to be installed specific to the OS. Running npm install locally doesn't throw away your node_modules, so if we just cache node_modules but also run npm install that should keep as much as possible and still improve install times since node_modules is already there. I think. ensure generated index.js and index.d.ts files are considered outputs use npx napi instead of napi directly include all package-lock.json files normalize caching further in all workflows drop nested package-lock.json files npm uninstall mini-css-extract-plugin && npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev bump webpack-5 integration tests dependencies only release insiders on master branch tmp: let's figure out release insiders oxide fix little typo use Node 18 for Oxide Insiders syncup package-lock.json let's try node 16 Node 18 currently fails on Build x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (OXIDE) Workflow.

341,Added tests for CLI utils,0.5982404,Fancy CLI updates,"use test with non-any type plugin choose backgroundSize over backgroundPosition Ensure that backgroundColor can take any value add tests to verify fallback plugins implement fallback plugins Whenever an arbitrary value results in css from multiple plugins we first try to resolve a falback plugin. The fallback mechanism works like this: If A has type any and B has type color, then B should win. This is because A will match anything, but the more precise type     should win instead. E.g.: backgroundColor has the type any so     bg-[100px_200px] would match both the backgroundColor and     backgroundSize but backgroundSize matched because of a specific     type and not because of the any type. - If A has type length and B has type [length, { disambiguate: true }], then B should win. This is because B marked the length as the plugin that should     win in case a clash happens. Add any type to a handful of plugins Needs tests tho Add any type to border-{x,y,t,r,b,l} plugins Add test for any type Split on multiple lines fixup add tests for implicit any types rename disambiguate to preferOnConflict update tests to reflect any types a bit better update changelog annotate any-type test with a bit more information Just for future debugging reasons!

This is useful when you define multiple background colors for example: ```html ``` In this case splitting by the regex would result in the proper result: js let result = [   'rgb(0,0,0)',   'rgb(255,255,255)' ] Visually, you can think of it like: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ        ¬∑                       ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚î¨    ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ We will split here     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ We properly split by , not inside a (). However, this RegEx fails the moment you have deeply nested RegEx values. Visually, this is what's happening: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ        ¬∑                         ‚î¨ ‚î¨ ‚î¨     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ We accidentally split here     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ This is because on the right of the ,, the first paren is an opening paren ( instead of a closing one ). I'm not 100% sure how we can improve the RegEx to handle that case as well, instead I wrote a small splitBy function that allows you to split the string by a character (just like you could do before) but ignores the ones inside the given exceptions. This keeps track of a stack to know whether we are within parens or not. Visually, the fix looks like this: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ        ¬∑                         ‚î¨ ‚î¨ ‚î¨             ‚î¨       ‚î¨   ‚î¨   ‚î¨     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ       ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ             ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ We will split here     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ use already existing splitAtTopLevelOnly function add faster implemetation for splitAtTopLevelOnly However, the faster version can't handle separators with multiple characters right now.

You can use it as: js addVariant('children', '& > ') Now you can use the children: variant. The API uses a & as a reference for the candidate, which means that: html children:pl-4 Will result in: css .children\:pl-4 > * { .. } Notice that the & was replaced by .children\:pl-4. We can leverage this API to implement arbitrary variants, this means that you can write those &> (Notice that we don't have spaces) inside a variant directly. An example of this can be: ```html A B C Which generates the following css:css .[\&>*]\:underline > * {   text-decoration-line: underline; } ``` Now all the children of the ul will have an underline. The selector itself is a bit crazy since it contains the candidate which is the selector itself, it is just escaped. add tests for arbitrary variants This still requires some work to the defaultExtractor to make sure it all works with existing code. update changelog Fix candidate detection for arbitrary variants Refactor Add support for at rules Add test for attribute selectors Fix test Add attribute selector support Split top-level comma parsing into a generalized splitting routine We can now split on any character at the top level with any nesting.

WIP: theme() utility function code completion This will give you code completion in the theme() function. The reason it is still a WIP is that this only works with the default config right now and not 100% sure if it is possible to define generics in JSDoc. The idea would be to: - Provide types from the default config - Provide types from the custom config (e.g.: 3rd party plugin) - Override default config types with the overrides of the user's config Right now this only provides types for the defaultConfig which might result in dropping all of this in favor of a much simpler: ts theme(path: string, defaultValue: D) => D But this sadly doesn't give you ""nice"" auto completion. However, the default might be good enough if we don't error on for example theme('customPlugin') which is currently not the case. update changelog undo all theme types, and type it as theme(path: string): any Since currently we don't want to investigate time to make the code completion perfect (because it might be even impossible to do it properly due to resolving of overrides, extend and deeply nested presets) For now we will provide a way simpler type, which is better than incorrect types.

When we write code like this: module Then we create 2 Nodes in our context to keep track of. One has identifier a, the other has identifier b. However, when we have an @apply and it contains multiple declarations/atrules, then we have to split up the (aka partition) node into multiple nodes so that we can guarantee the correct expected sort order. This means that the above example technically looks like this: module If this was your input, then we would still have 1 node for identifier 'a', but we would have 2 nodes for identifier 'b'. As mentioned earlier, this is important to guarantee the correct order, here is an example: css .b {   @apply md:font-bold xl:font-normal; / Here we can sort by our   internal rules. This means that the module comes before module. / } ... however module So to guarantee the order when doing this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal;   @apply lg:font-normal; } We also split this up into 2 nodes like this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal; } .b {   @apply lg:font-normal; } The tricky part is that now only 1 empty .b node exists in our context because we partitioned the orginal node into multiple nodes and moved the children to the new nodes and because they are new nodes it means that they have a different identity. This partitioning used to happen in the expandApplyAtRules code, but this is a bit too late because the context has already been filled at this time. Instead, we move the code more to the front, as if you wrote those separated blocks yourself. Now the code to inject those nodes into the context happens in a single spot instead of multiple places. Another good part about this is that we have better consistency between each layer because it turns out that these two examples generated different results... css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase;   color: red; } ... is different compared to: css @tailwind components; @layer components {   .a {     @apply b;   }   .b {     @apply uppercase;     color: red;   } } Even if both a and b are being used in one of your content paths... Yeah.. sigh add more @apply related tests update changelog remove support for basic nesting (leftover) remove leftover todo This has been fixed already",0

This is useful because now our Map looks something like this: js Map(2) { 'foo' => Node {}, 'bar' => Node {} } This allows us to later on @apply foo or @apply bar and we can do a direct lookup for this ""candidate"". When we have css defined as span {}, then we consider this ""non-ondemandable"". This means that we will always inject these rules into the * section and call it a day. However, it could happen that you have something like this: span, .foo {} up until now this was totally fine. It contains a non-ondemandable selector (span) and therefore we injected this into that * section. However, the issue occurs if you now try to @apply foo. Since we had an early return for this use case it didn't endup in our Map from above and now you get an error like: The module class does not exist. If module is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a module directive."" So instead what we will do is keep track whether or not a css rule contains any on-demandable classes. If this is the case then we still generate it always by putting it in that * section. However, we will still register all on-demandable classes in our Map (in this case .foo). This allows us to @apply foo again! update changelog",1

754,"Don't inherit gradient ""to"" from parent (#8489)",0.90065724,Don't inherit to value from parent gradients (#8489),"improve collapsing of duplicate properties In theory, we don't have to do anything because the browser is smart enough to figure everything out. However, leaving in duplicate properties is not that ideal for file size. Our previous method was pretty simple: if you see a declaration you already saw in this rule, delete the previous one and keep the current one. This works pretty well, but this gets rid of all the declarations with the same property. This is not great for overrides for older browsers. In a perfect world, we can handle this based on your target browser but this is a lot of unnecessary complexity and will slow things down performance wise. Alternative, we improved the solution by being a bit smarter: 1. Delete duplicate declarations that have the same property and value    (this will get rid of exact duplications). 2. Delete declarations with the same property and the same unit. This means that we will reduce this: css .example {   height: 50%;   height: 100px;   height: 20vh;   height: 30%;   height: 50px;   height: 30vh;   transform: var(--value);   transform: var(--value); } To: diff-css   .example { -   height: 50%;    / Another height exists later with a module unit / -   height: 100px;  / Another height exists later with a module unit / -   height: 20vh;   / Another height exists later with a module unit /     height: 30%;     height: 50px;     height: 30vh; -   transform: var(--value); / Value is too complex, but is exactly the same as the one below /     transform: var(--value);   } This will reduce the values that we are 100% sure that can be safely removed. This will still result in some overrides but the browser can handle those for you. Fixes: #6844 update changelog",1

This is useful because decoration-[var(--something)] would be correctly translated to the correct decoration property. However, we introduce another plugin with the same decoration prefix. This means that now both textDecorationColor and textDecorationThickness have the same base utility name: decoration. textDecorationColor had ['color', 'any'] textDecorationThickness had ['length', 'percentage'] This means that 3px fit both in the length data type of the textDecorationThickness plugin and in the any data type of the textDecorationColor plugin. Removing the any fixes this. TL;DR: Only have any when there are no conflicting utility names. remove utility that doesn't generate css Having decoration-[var(--abc)] is ambiguous because there are multiple plugins that have a decoration utility name.

The idea is that it can take a list of strings that define a certain format. Then it squashes everything to a single format how you would expect it. E.g.: Input:   - '&:hover'   - '&:focus'   - '.dark &'   - ':merge(.group):hover &'   - ':merge(.group):focus &' Output:   - ':merge(.group):focus:hover .dark &:focus:hover' The API here is:   - &, this means ""The parent"" or ""The previous selector"" (you can     think of it like if you are using nested selectors)   - :merge(.group), this means insert a .group if it doesn't exist     yet, but if it does exist already, then merge the new value with the     old value. This allows us to merge group-focus, group-hover into a     single .group:focus:hover ... add new format, withRule and wrap API for addVariant implement backwards compatibility This will ensure that the backwards compatibility for modifySelectors and direct mutations to the container will still work. We will try to capture the changes made to the rule.selector, we will also ""backup"" the existing selector. This allows us to diff the old and new selectors and determine what actually happened. Once we know this, we can restore the selector to the ""old"" selector and add the diffed string e.g.: .foo &, to the collectedFormats as if you called format() directly. This is a bunch of extra work, but it allows us to be backwards compatible. In the future we could also warn if you are using modifySelectors, but it is going to be a little bit tricky, because usually that's implemented by plugin authors and therefore you don't have direct control over this. Maybe we can figure out the plugin this is used in and change the warning somehow? fix incorrect test This was clearly a bug, keyframes should not include escaped variants at all. The reason this is here in the first place is because the nodes in a keyframe are also ""rule"" nodes. swap the order of pseudo states The current implementation had a strange side effect, that resulted in incorrect class definitions. When you are combining the :hover and :focus event, then there is no difference between :hover:focus and :focus:hover. However, when you use :hover::file-selector-button or ::file-selector-button:hover, then there is a big difference. In the first place, you can hover over the full file input to apply changes to the File selector button. In the second scenario you have to hover over the File selector button itself to apply changes. You can think of it as function calls: - focus(hover(text-center)) What you would expect is something like this: .focus\:hover\:text-center:hover:focus, where hover is on the inside, and focus is on the outside. However in the current implementation this is implemented as .focus\:hover\:text-cener:focus:hover add more variant tests for the new API update parallel variants tests to make use of new API implement core variants with new API simplify/cleanup existing plugin utils We can get rid of this because we drastically simplified the new addVariant API. add addVariant shorthand signature The current API looks like this: module It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ format }) => format('.dark &')) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '.dark &') It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ wrap }) => wrap(postcss.atRule({ name: 'media', params: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' }))) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)') improve fontVariantNumeric implementation We will use @defaults, so that only the resets are injected for the utilities we actually use. fix typo allow for nested addVariant shorthand This will allow to write something like: js addVariant('name', module) // Or as a one-liner addVariant('name', '@supports (hover: hover) { @media (print) { &:hover } }') update changelog",1

In this case we do appreciate an issue in that case üòÖ. update tests to use optimized universal selector update integration tests add dedicated tests for the optimized universal selector improve minimumImpactSelector algorithm I think I cracked the algorithm, but I will probably need another pair of eyes on the subject. The current implementation works like this: Prerequisites: The selector should already have been parsed using the selectorParser   from 'postcss-selector-parser'. Algorithm: Remove all of the pseudo classes from the list of nodes.   1.1. We do want to keep pseudo elements (E.g.: ::before, ::first-line, ...)   1.2. We do want to keep pseudo classes that contain nodes (E.g.:     :not(...)) Reverse the list of nodes.   This will make it easier to search from the end to the start. For   example .group:hover .group-hover should result in .group-hover   not .group.   2.1. Find the index of the best match (class, id, attribute), and     convert the node if required. (E.g.: span#app -> #app => [id=""app""])   2.2. Remove the rest of the selector that is not important anymore   2.3. Re-join the left-over nodes together update tests using new algorithm also look for tag types take tag into account simplify logic add test to prove rest.reverse() in first case is required In case we don't find a match (idx === -1), we use rest.reverse(). However, it looks like you can just use nodes instead. This is not entirely true, because the rest variable will contain only the nodes that are not pseudo elements. :hover would result in :hover instead of just * replace all nodes after > with a single universal selector",0

We also updated the way we write those tests, essentially making Tailwind a blackbox, by testing against the final output. Now that JIT mode is the default, this is super fast because we only generate what is used, instead of partially testing in a 3MB file or building it all, then purging. add some todo's to make sure we warn in a few cases make darkMode: 'media', the default This also includes moving dark mode tests to its own dedicated file. remove PostCSS 7 compat mode update CLI to be JIT-first fix integration tests This is not a real fix, but it does solve the broken test for now. warn when using @responsive or @variants remove the JIT preview warning remove AOT-only code paths remove all mode: 'jit' blocks Also remove variants: {} since they are not useful in JIT mode anymore. drop unused dependencies rename purge to content remove static CDN builds mark --purge as deprecated in the CLI This will still work, but a warning will be printed and it won't show up in the --help output. cleanup nesting plugin We don't have to duplicate it anymore since there is no PostCSS 7 version anymore. make sure integration tests run in band cleanup folder structure make sure nesting folder is available simplify resolving of purge/content information",0

Concrete example: Current state: index.js            // PostCSS 8 implementation index.postcss7.js   // PostCSS 7 implementation Run ""compat"" index.js            // PostCSS 7 implementation index.postcss7.js   // PostCSS 7 implementation index.postcss8.js   // PostCSS 8 implementation (Backup of original) Run ""compat:restore"" index.js            // PostCSS 8 implementation index.postcss7.js   // PostCSS 7 implementation X index.postcss8.js // PostCSS 8 implementation (Removed) Update README.md ensure we npm install before publishing Co-authored-by: Adam Wathan adam.wathan@gmail.com",0

3262,Revert fix lint errors?!,0.50623477,Rebundle to fix missing CLI peer dependencies,"Not 100% convinced this is a net positive change, but I regret not having done things this way at the beginning. In 0.x, we pass the separator and className values already escaped, so : comes through as \: for example, and w-1/2 comes through as w-1\/2. At first this sounds fine, less work for the plugin author right? But CSS escaping rules are kind of complicated and you have to escape characters differently depending on whether or not they are at the start of an identifier. For example, it's totally fine for a class to contain a zero (0 ), but it can't start with a zero. For a class to start with a zero, it needs to be escaped like this: \30 This means that as a general rule, trying to escape the individual segments of a class separately is a bad idea ‚Äî you should escape the class as a whole so only the necessary escaping is applied. We break this rule when we pre-escape the separator and className for plugin authors who use the modifySelectors function. We already require users to manually escape class names when they are using addUtilities or addComponents, so to me it feels more consistent for things to work this way and it's how they should have worked from day one. Basically this code: js function({ addVariant }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return module     })   }) }, ...would need to be re-written like this if I merge this change: js function({ addVariant, e }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return modulefirst-child${separator}${className}module     })   }) }, Although I think this is the right way for this to work, I hesitate because it's a breaking change that makes any variant plugins authored for 0.x incompatible with 1.x. It's an easy fix on the plugin author's part, but it's still annoying. I'm leaning towards merging so I don't regret this even more later when the plugin ecosystem is a lot bigger.
