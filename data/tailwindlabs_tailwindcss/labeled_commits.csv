1,Source borderWidth options from config,0.6695764,Support border-opacity utilities alongside default border utility (#4277)," run PostCSS relative to test file  The PostCSS from was always set to the tests/util/run file with the current test name as a query param to make it unique. However, that results in issues with relative file paths because they are now relative to this file instead of the actual test file. Luckily, expect.getState() exposes the testPath value that points to the current test file itself.   add built in @import processing   additional features such that you can use @tailwind and @config   directives before the @import at rule which isn't normally allowed.   However ""@tailwind"" in a way is an @import and @config in a way is   a @charset which can be used before the @import at rule.   drop partial normalizeTailwindDirectives when in the Oxide engine   This will now be handled by Tailwind from a higher level, so the core doesn't have to worry about normalizing this anymore since it will always be normalized right now.   add handleImportAtRules to CLI   update changelog   scope import processing to the oxide engine   update Changelog   use direct comparison   We don't need the startsWith check anymore because the contents of the comment will be the actual value we expect.",0

5,Add peer variant (#4556),0.68209314,JIT: Don't add multiple ~ when stacking peer-* variants (#4757),"  resolve all existing content paths   pin @napi-rs/cli   WIP: Log all resolved content files/globs   only filter out raw changed content in non-auto mode   skip parseCandidateFiles cache in auto mode   improve algorithm of detecting content paths   Files in the root should be listed statically instead of using globs.  Files and folders in special known direct child folders should be    listed statically instead of using globs (e.g.: public). This is    because these special folders are often used to store generated AND    source files at the same time. Using globs could trigger infinite    loops because we are watching and acting upon dist files. All file extensions found in the project, should be used in the globs    in addition to a known set of extensions.  Direct folders seen from the root, can use the glob syntax    <root>/src/**/*.{...known-extensions}   inline wanted-extensions   Not 100% convinced yet, but seems cleaner so far.   ensure writing an file also makes the parent folder(s)   add integration tests for the auto content feature   add pnpm and bun lock files   Revert ""inline wanted-extensions""   This reverts commit 879c1248524e84216125f4a24e0160b40736333a.   sort binary-extensions and add lockb   sort + add lock to ignored extensions   drop yarn.lock, because lock extensions are already covered   group template extensions   This will make it a bit easier to organize in the future.   drop empty lines and commented lines from template-extensions   skip the config path when resolving template files   The config file will automatically trigger a rebuild when this file is changed. However, this should not be part of the template files because that could cause additional css that's not being used.   make auto content the default in the oxide engine   In the oxide engine, the default content: [] will be dropped from   the default configuration (config.simple.js, config.full.js).   If you have content: [] or content: { files: [] } then the auto   content feature won't be active. However if those arrays are empty a   warning will still be shown. Adding files/globs or dropping the   content section completely will enable auto content.   only test the auto content integration test in the oxide engine   set content.files to auto instead of using auto: boolean   This way we don't run into the issue where the config.content.files is set and the config.content.auto is set to true.   drop log   ensure we validate the config in the CLI   show experimental warning for automatic content detection   use cached version of the getCandidateFiles instead of bypassing it   use is_empty() shorthand   Thanks, Clippy!   add test to ensure nested ignored folders are not scanned   add tempfile for tests   add auto content tests in Rust   refactor auto content detection   This will also make sure that if we have (deeply) nested ignored folders, then we won't use deeply nested globs (/.{js,html}) for the parent(s) of the nested ignored folders but instead use a shallow glob for each directory (/*.{js,html}). Then each sibling directory of the parent can use deeply nested globs again except for the direct parent.   use consistent comments   ensure ignored static listed files are not present   improve performance by ~30x   On a big test project this goes from ~6s to ~200ms  improve performance by ~5x  We started with a ~6s duration Then in the previous commit, we improved it by ~30x and it went down to ~200ms Now with this change, it takes about ~40ms. That's another ~5x improvement. Or in total a ~150x improvement.   ensure nested folders in public/ are also explicitly listed   add shortcut for normalizing files   This is only called once so won't do anything to the main performance of Tailwind CSS. But always nice to make small performance improvements!   run Rust tests in CI   fix lint warnings   update changelog   Update CHANGELOG.md    Co-authored-by: Robin Malfait malfait.robin@gmail.com",0

57,Add hex codes next to colors,0.6218051,+     colors: {," fix assumption when resolving dependencies  When resolving dependencies given a path, we are only interested relative files from the current file. We are not interested in the dependencies that are listed in your package.json and thus in your node_modules folder. We made the assumption that your imports have at least 3 characters. This sort of makes sense because there will be a ., then the OS separator like / and than a file name. E.g.: ./a is the minimal amount of characters. This makes sense for import statements, but in the case of require, it is totally valid to write require('.'). This will require the current index.{js,ts,mjs,cjs,...} in the current directory. Before this change, having a require('.') wouldn't crash, but the dependency would not be marked as a module dependencies and therefore we won't listen for file changes for that dependency.  update changelog",0

The fallback mechanism works like this:  If A has type any and B has type color, then B should win.   This is because A will match anything, but the more precise type     should win instead. E.g.: backgroundColor has the type any so     bg-[100px_200px] would match both the backgroundColor and     backgroundSize but backgroundSize matched because of a specific     type and not because of the any type. - If A has type length and B has type [length, { disambiguate: true }], then B should win. This is because B marked the length as the plugin that should     win in case a clash happens.   Add any type to a handful of plugins  Needs tests tho   Add any type to border-{x,y,t,r,b,l} plugins   Add test for any type   Split on multiple lines   fixup   add tests for implicit any types   rename disambiguate to preferOnConflict   update tests to reflect any types a bit better   update changelog   annotate any-type test with a bit more information   Just for future debugging reasons!

This is useful when you define multiple background colors for example: ```html  ``` In this case splitting by the regex would result in the proper result: js let result = [   'rgb(0,0,0)',   'rgb(255,255,255)' ] Visually, you can think of it like: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ   <div class=""bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]""></div>     ¬∑                       ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚î¨    ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ We will split here     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ We properly split by , not inside a (). However, this RegEx fails the moment you have deeply nested RegEx values. Visually, this is what's happening: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ   <div class=""bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha))]""></div>     ¬∑                         ‚î¨ ‚î¨ ‚î¨     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ We accidentally split here     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ This is because on the right of the ,, the first paren is an opening paren ( instead of a closing one ). I'm not 100% sure how we can improve the RegEx to handle that case as well, instead I wrote a small splitBy function that allows you to split the string by a character (just like you could do before) but ignores the ones inside the given exceptions. This keeps track of a stack to know whether we are within parens or not. Visually, the fix looks like this: ‚îå‚îÄ[./example.html]     ‚îÇ ‚àô 1 ‚îÇ   <div class=""bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha)),rgb(255,255,255,var(--alpha))]""></div>     ¬∑                         ‚î¨ ‚î¨ ‚î¨             ‚î¨       ‚î¨   ‚î¨   ‚î¨     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ       ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ¬∑                         ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ             ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ We will split here     ¬∑                         ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Guarded by parens     ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ   use already existing splitAtTopLevelOnly function   add faster implemetation for splitAtTopLevelOnly   However, the faster version can't handle separators with multiple characters right now.

542,Fix backgrond typo in installation docs.,0.5421566,Fix CLI tool not loading config files properly (#149)," register arbitrary variants  With the new addVariant API, we have a beautiful way of creating new variants. You can use it as: js addVariant('children', '& > *') Now you can use the children: variant. The API uses a & as a reference for the candidate, which means that: html children:pl-4 Will result in: css .children\:pl-4 > * { .. } Notice that the & was replaced by .children\:pl-4. We can leverage this API to implement arbitrary variants, this means that you can write those &>* (Notice that we don't have spaces) inside a variant directly. An example of this can be: ```html  A B C  Which generates the following css:css .[\&>*]\:underline > * {   text-decoration-line: underline; } ``` Now all the children of the ul will have an underline. The selector itself is a bit crazy since it contains the candidate which is the selector itself, it is just escaped.  add tests for arbitrary variants  This still requires some work to the defaultExtractor to make sure it all works with existing code.   update changelog   Fix candidate detection for arbitrary variants   Refactor   Add support for at rules   Add test for attribute selectors   Fix test   Add attribute selector support   Split top-level comma parsing into a generalized splitting routine   We can now split on any character at the top level with any nesting.

585,Update readme,0.51250124,Updated documentation," ensure the percentage data type is validated correctly  When checking for our data types, we have to make sure that each part is correct, this wasn't happening for the percentage data type, which meant that top_right_50% was a valid percentage value because it ended in % which is not correct. Because of this, the generated code was non-existent because we got a warning: The class bg-[top_right_50%] is ambiguous and matches multiple utilities.      Use bg-[length:top_right_50%] for background-size: top right 50%      Use bg-[position:top_right_50%] for background-position: top right 50%    If this is content and not a class, replace it with bg-&lsqb;top_right_50%&rsqb; to silence this warning. But this is not correct because this can never be a valid background size due to the top right section. This fixes it by validating each part individually, and now we get generated css.  update changelog",0
586,Port position module to plugin,0.65433276,Plugin system," allow for arbitrary configuration in the theme section  This is useful for third party plugins otherwise you will get an error.  WIP: theme() utility function code completion  This will give you code completion in the theme() function. The reason it is still a WIP is that this only works with the default config right now and not 100% sure if it is possible to define generics in JSDoc. The idea would be to: - Provide types from the default config - Provide types from the custom config (e.g.: 3rd party plugin) - Override default config types with the overrides of the user's config Right now this only provides types for the defaultConfig which might result in dropping all of this in favor of a much simpler: ts theme<D = any>(path: string, defaultValue: D) => D But this sadly doesn't give you ""nice"" auto completion. However, the default might be good enough if we don't error on for example theme('customPlugin') which is currently not the case.   update changelog   undo all theme types, and type it as theme(path: string): any   Since currently we don't want to investigate time to make the code completion perfect (because it might be even impossible to do it properly due to resolving of overrides, extend and deeply nested presets) For now we will provide a way simpler type, which is better than incorrect types. So far we only had types for the default config theme only.",0

728,Give the whole config access to plugins if needed.,0.8563989,Access entire config object from plugins," partition nodes as soon as possible  Time to write another story on @apply... When we write code like this: ```css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase;   color: red; } ``` Then we create 2 Nodes in our context to keep track of. One has identifier a, the other has identifier b. However, when we have an @apply and it contains multiple declarations/atrules, then we have to split up the (aka partition) node into multiple nodes so that we can guarantee the correct expected sort order. This means that the above example technically looks like this: ```css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase; } .b {   color: red; } ``` If this was your input, then we would still have 1 node for identifier 'a', but we would have 2 nodes for identifier 'b'. As mentioned earlier, this is important to guarantee the correct order, here is an example: css .b {   @apply md:font-bold xl:font-normal; /* Here we can sort by our   internal rules. This means that the `md` comes before `xl`. */ } ... however ```css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal; / This now exists before the example below / } .b {   @apply md:font-bold; / Because we respect the order of the user's css / } ``` So to guarantee the order when doing this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal;   @apply lg:font-normal; } We also split this up into 2 nodes like this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal; } .b {   @apply lg:font-normal; } The tricky part is that now only 1 empty .b node exists in our context because we partitioned the orginal node into multiple nodes and moved the children to the new nodes and because they are new nodes it means that they have a different identity. This partitioning used to happen in the expandApplyAtRules code, but this is a bit too late because the context has already been filled at this time. Instead, we move the code more to the front, as if you wrote those separated blocks yourself. Now the code to inject those nodes into the context happens in a single spot instead of multiple places. Another good part about this is that we have better consistency between each layer because it turns out that these two examples generated different results... css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase;   color: red; } ... is different compared to: css @tailwind components; @layer components {   .a {     @apply b;   }   .b {     @apply uppercase;     color: red;   } } Even if both a and b are being used in one of your content paths... Yeah.. sigh   add more @apply related tests   update changelog   remove support for basic nesting (leftover)   remove leftover todo   This has been fixed already",1

733,Source visibility options from config,0.5712621,Background origin utilities," improve extractCandidates  When we have a css rule that is defined as .foo, .bar {}, then we will crawl each selector and link it to the same node. This is useful because now our Map looks something like this: js Map(2) { 'foo' => Node {}, 'bar' => Node {} } This allows us to later on @apply foo or @apply bar and we can do a direct lookup for this ""candidate"". When we have css defined as span {}, then we consider this ""non-ondemandable"". This means that we will always inject these rules into the * section and call it a day. However, it could happen that you have something like this: span, .foo {} up until now this was totally fine. It contains a non-ondemandable selector (span) and therefore we injected this into that * section. However, the issue occurs if you now try to @apply foo. Since we had an early return for this use case it didn't endup in our Map from above and now you get an error like: The `foo` class does not exist. If `foo` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive."" So instead what we will do is keep track whether or not a css rule contains any on-demandable classes. If this is the case then we still generate it always by putting it in that * section. However, we will still register all on-demandable classes in our Map (in this case .foo). This allows us to @apply foo again!  update changelog",0

754,Provide default to <alpha-value> when using theme() (#8652),1.0000002,Provide default to <alpha-value> when using theme() (#8652)," improve collapsing of duplicate properties  In theory, we don't have to do anything because the browser is smart enough to figure everything out. However, leaving in duplicate properties is not that ideal for file size. Our previous method was pretty simple: if you see a declaration you already saw in this rule, delete the previous one and keep the current one. This works pretty well, but this gets rid of all the declarations with the same property. This is not great for overrides for older browsers. In a perfect world, we can handle this based on your target browser but this is a lot of unnecessary complexity and will slow things down performance wise. Alternative, we improved the solution by being a bit smarter: 1. Delete duplicate declarations that have the same property and value    (this will get rid of exact duplications). 2. Delete declarations with the same property and the same unit. This means that we will reduce this: css .example {   height: 50%;   height: 100px;   height: 20vh;   height: 30%;   height: 50px;   height: 30vh;   transform: var(--value);   transform: var(--value); } To: diff-css   .example { -   height: 50%;    /* Another height exists later with a `%` unit */ -   height: 100px;  /* Another height exists later with a `px` unit */ -   height: 20vh;   /* Another height exists later with a `vh` unit */     height: 30%;     height: 50px;     height: 30vh; -   transform: var(--value); /* Value is too complex, but is **exactly** the same as the one below */     transform: var(--value);   } This will reduce the values that we are 100% sure that can be safely removed. This will still result in some overrides but the browser can handle those for you. Fixes: #6844  update changelog",1

However, in this case we have an issue that user defined css is technically also a plugin. This means that:   - bg-green-light Would check for:   - bg-green-light (no hit, continue)   - bg-green (Hit! Don't execute next plugins)   - bg (This is the one that would have generated bg-green-light) We tested this change and it doesn't seem to have an impact functionally and also not really performance wise.  update changelog",0

This is useful because decoration-[var(--something)] would be correctly translated to the correct decoration property. However, we introduce another plugin with the same decoration prefix. This means that now both textDecorationColor and textDecorationThickness have the same base utility name: decoration.  textDecorationColor had ['color', 'any'] textDecorationThickness had ['length', 'percentage']  This means that 3px fit both in the length data type of the textDecorationThickness plugin and in the any data type of the textDecorationColor plugin. Removing the any fixes this. TL;DR: Only have any when there are no conflicting utility names.  remove utility that doesn't generate css  Having decoration-[var(--abc)] is ambiguous because there are multiple plugins that have a decoration utility name.

The idea is that it can take a list of strings that define a certain format. Then it squashes everything to a single format how you would expect it. E.g.: Input:   - '&:hover'   - '&:focus'   - '.dark &'   - ':merge(.group):hover &'   - ':merge(.group):focus &' Output:   - ':merge(.group):focus:hover .dark &:focus:hover' The API here is:   - &, this means ""The parent"" or ""The previous selector"" (you can     think of it like if you are using nested selectors)   - :merge(.group), this means insert a .group if it doesn't exist     yet, but if it does exist already, then merge the new value with the     old value. This allows us to merge group-focus, group-hover into a     single .group:focus:hover ...   add new format, withRule and wrap API for addVariant   implement backwards compatibility   This will ensure that the backwards compatibility for modifySelectors and direct mutations to the container will still work. We will try to capture the changes made to the rule.selector, we will also ""backup"" the existing selector. This allows us to diff the old and new selectors and determine what actually happened. Once we know this, we can restore the selector to the ""old"" selector and add the diffed string e.g.: .foo &, to the collectedFormats as if you called format() directly. This is a bunch of extra work, but it allows us to be backwards compatible. In the future we could also warn if you are using modifySelectors, but it is going to be a little bit tricky, because usually that's implemented by plugin authors and therefore you don't have direct control over this. Maybe we can figure out the plugin this is used in and change the warning somehow?  fix incorrect test  This was clearly a bug, keyframes should not include escaped variants at all. The reason this is here in the first place is because the nodes in a keyframe are also ""rule"" nodes.  swap the order of pseudo states  The current implementation had a strange side effect, that resulted in incorrect class definitions. When you are combining the :hover and :focus event, then there is no difference between :hover:focus and :focus:hover. However, when you use :hover::file-selector-button or ::file-selector-button:hover, then there is a big difference. In the first place, you can hover over the full file input to apply changes to the File selector button. In the second scenario you have to hover over the File selector button itself to apply changes. You can think of it as function calls: - focus(hover(text-center)) What you would expect is something like this: .focus\:hover\:text-center:hover:focus, where hover is on the inside, and focus is on the outside. However in the current implementation this is implemented as .focus\:hover\:text-cener:focus:hover   add more variant tests for the new API   update parallel variants tests to make use of new API   implement core variants with new API   simplify/cleanup existing plugin utils   We can get rid of this because we drastically simplified the new addVariant API.  add addVariant shorthand signature  The current API looks like this: ```js addVariant('name', ({ format, wrap }) => {   // Wrap in an atRule   wrap(postcss.atRule({ name: 'media', params: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' })) // ""Mutate"" the selector, for example prepend .dark   format('.dark &') }) ``` It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ format }) => format('.dark &')) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '.dark &') It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ wrap }) => wrap(postcss.atRule({ name: 'media', params: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' }))) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')  improve fontVariantNumeric implementation  We will use @defaults, so that only the resets are injected for the utilities we actually use.   fix typo   allow for nested addVariant shorthand   This will allow to write something like: js addVariant('name', `   @supports (hover: hover) {     @media (print) {       &:hover     }   } `) // Or as a one-liner addVariant('name', '@supports (hover: hover) { @media (print) { &:hover } }')  update changelog",1

The current implementation works like this: Prerequisites:  The selector should already have been parsed using the selectorParser   from 'postcss-selector-parser'.  Algorithm:  Remove all of the pseudo classes from the list of nodes.   1.1. We do want to keep pseudo elements (E.g.: ::before, ::first-line, ...)   1.2. We do want to keep pseudo classes that contain nodes (E.g.:     :not(...))  Reverse the list of nodes.   This will make it easier to search from the end to the start. For   example .group:hover .group-hover should result in .group-hover   not .group.   2.1. Find the index of the best match (class, id, attribute), and     convert the node if required. (E.g.: span#app -> #app => [id=""app""])   2.2. Remove the rest of the selector that is not important anymore   2.3. Re-join the left-over nodes together   update tests using new algorithm   also look for tag types   take tag into account   simplify logic   add test to prove rest.reverse() in first case is required   In case we don't find a match (idx === -1), we use rest.reverse(). However, it looks like you can just use nodes instead. This is not entirely true, because the rest variable will contain only the nodes that are not pseudo elements. *:hover would result in *:hover instead of just *  replace all nodes after > with a single universal selector",0

This is nice in a way because now we don't have to run all of the guessing type code.

3262,"Revert ""Remove blocklisted classes from autocomplete (#10844)""",0.6317652,Fix missing blocklist member in the Config type (#10239),"Not 100% convinced this is a net positive change, but I regret not having done things this way at the beginning. In 0.x, we pass the separator and className values already escaped, so : comes through as \: for example, and w-1/2 comes through as w-1\/2. At first this sounds fine, less work for the plugin author right? But CSS escaping rules are kind of complicated and you have to escape characters differently depending on whether or not they are at the start of an identifier. For example, it's totally fine for a class to contain a zero (0 ), but it can't start with a zero. For a class to start with a zero, it needs to be escaped like this: \30 This means that as a general rule, trying to escape the individual segments of a class separately is a bad idea ‚Äî you should escape the class as a whole so only the necessary escaping is applied. We break this rule when we pre-escape the separator and className for plugin authors who use the modifySelectors function. We already require users to manually escape class names when they are using addUtilities or addComponents, so to me it feels more consistent for things to work this way and it's how they should have worked from day one. Basically this code: js function({ addVariant }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return `.first-child${separator}${className}:first-child`     })   }) }, ...would need to be re-written like this if I merge this change: js function({ addVariant, e }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return `.${e(`first-child${separator}${className}`)}:first-child`     })   }) }, Although I think this is the right way for this to work, I hesitate because it's a breaking change that makes any variant plugins authored for 0.x incompatible with 1.x. It's an easy fix on the plugin author's part, but it's still annoying. I'm leaning towards merging so I don't regret this even more later when the plugin ecosystem is a lot bigger. Anyone have any thoughts?",0
