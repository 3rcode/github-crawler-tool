5,[Oxide] Automatic content detection (#11173),"  resolve all existing content paths   pin @napi-rs/cli   WIP: Log all resolved content files/globs   only filter out raw changed content in non-auto mode   skip parseCandidateFiles cache in auto mode   improve algorithm of detecting content paths   Files in the root should be listed statically instead of using globs.  Files and folders in special known direct child folders should be    listed statically instead of using globs (e.g.: public). This is    because these special folders are often used to store generated AND    source files at the same time. Using globs could trigger infinite    loops because we are watching and acting upon dist files. All file extensions found in the project, should be used in the globs    in addition to a known set of extensions.  Direct folders seen from the root, can use the glob syntax    <root>/src/**/*.{...known-extensions}   inline wanted-extensions   Not 100% convinced yet, but seems cleaner so far.   ensure writing an file also makes the parent folder(s)   add integration tests for the auto content feature   add pnpm and bun lock files   Revert ""inline wanted-extensions""   This reverts commit 879c1248524e84216125f4a24e0160b40736333a.   sort binary-extensions and add lockb   sort + add lock to ignored extensions   drop yarn.lock, because lock extensions are already covered   group template extensions   This will make it a bit easier to organize in the future.   drop empty lines and commented lines from template-extensions   skip the config path when resolving template files   The config file will automatically trigger a rebuild when this file is changed.

57,Fix format assumption when resolving module dependencies (#10878)," fix assumption when resolving dependencies  When resolving dependencies given a path, we are only interested relative files from the current file. We are not interested in the dependencies that are listed in your package.json and thus in your node_modules folder. We made the assumption that your imports have at least 3 characters. This sort of makes sense because there will be a ., then the OS separator like / and than a file name. E.g.: ./a is the minimal amount of characters. This makes sense for import statements, but in the case of require, it is totally valid to write require('.'). This will require the current index.{js,ts,mjs,cjs,...} in the current directory. Before this change, having a require('.') wouldn't crash, but the dependency would not be marked as a module dependencies and therefore we won't listen for file changes for that dependency.  update changelog",Fix format assumption when resolving module dependencies (#10878),"fix assumption when resolving dependencies When resolving dependencies given a path, we are only interested relative files from the current file.

156,Improve CSS output in tests to better reflect reality (#10454),  drop empty lines when diffing output   replace expected css with optimized lightningcss output   Lightning CSS generates a more optimal CSS output. Right now the tests are setup in a way that both the generated css and expected css are run through lightningcss to make sure that the output is concistent for the stable and oxide engines. But this also means that the expected output could be larger (aka not optimized) and still matches (after it runs through lightningcss). By replacing this with the more optimal output we achieve a few things:  This better reflects reality since we will be using lightningcss. This gets rid of unnecessary css.

However, some scripts still need to be installed specific to the OS. Running npm install locally doesn't throw away your node_modules, so if we just cache node_modules but also run npm install that should keep as much as possible and still improve install times since node_modules is already there.

Setup some tests that run both the non-Rust and Rust version in the   same test. Sort the candidates in a consistent way, to guarantee the order for   now (especially in tests). Reflect sorting related changes in tests. Ensure tests run in both the Rust and non-Rust version. (Some tests   are explicitly skipped when using the Rust version since we haven't   implemented those features yet. These include: custom prefix,   transformers and extractors). jest   -OXIDE=1 jest remove into_par_iter where it doesn't make sense cargo fmt wip enable tracing based on DEBUG env improve CI for the Oxide build sort test output This happened because the sorting happens in this branch, but changes happened on the master branch. add failing tests I noticed that some of the tests were failing, and while looking at them, it happened because the tests were structured like this: html      This means that the class names themselves eventually end up like this: backdrop-filter-none\n -> (Notice the \n) /cc @thecrypticace fix range to include \n Include only unique values for tests Really, what we care about most is that the list contains every expected candidate. Not necessarily how many times it shows up because while many candidates will show up A LOT in a source text we’ll unique them before passing them back to anything that needs them Fix failing tests Don’t match empty arbitrary values skip tests in oxide mode regarding custom separators in arbitrary variants re-enable workflows use @tailwindcss/oxide dependency publish tailwindcss@oxide drop prepublishOnly I don't think we actually need this anymore (or even want because this is trying to do things in CI that we don't want to happen. Aka, build the Oxide Rust code, it is already a dependency). WIP Defer to existing CLI for Oxide Include new compiled typescript stuff when publishing Move TS to ./src/oxide Update scripts Clean up tests for TS copy cli to oxide/cli make CLI files TypeScript files drop --postcss flag setup lightningcss Remove autoprefixer and cssnano from oxide CLI cleanup Rust code a little bit Drop commented out code Drop 500 fixture templates sort test output re-add prepublishOnly script bump SWC dependencies in package-lock.json pin @swc dependencies ensure to install and build oxide update all GitHub Workflows to reflect Oxide required changes sort content-resolution integration tests add Release Insiders — Oxide setup turbo repo + remote caching use npx to invoke turbo setup unique/proper package names for integration tests add missing isomorphic-fetch dependency setup integration tests to use turborepo scope tailwind tasks to root workspace re-enable node_modules cache for integration tests re-enable node_modules cache for main CI workflow split cache for main and oxide node_modules fix indent split install dependencies so that they can be cached individually improve GitHub actions caching use correct path for oxide node_modules (crates/node) ensure that cargo install always succeeds cargo install X, on CI will fail if it already exists. figure out integration tests with turbo tmp: use npm instead of turbo disable fail-fast This will allow us to run integration tests so that it still caches the succesful ones. YAML OH YAML, Y U WHITESPACE SENSITIVE copy the oxide-ci workflow to release-oxide make oxide-ci a normal CI workflow Without publishing try to cache cargo and node_modules for the oxide build configure turbo to run scripts in the root explicitly skip failing test for the Oxide version run oxide tests in CI only use build script for root package sync package-lock.json do not cache node_modules for each individual integration look for hoisted .bin use turbo for caching build tailwind css in integration tests Robin... try to use the local binary first skip installing integration test dependencies Should already be installed due to workspace usage Robin... drop output.clean explicitly add mini-css-extract-plugin drop oxide-ci, this is tested by proxy ensure oxide build is used in integration tests This will ensure the @tailwindcss/oxide dependency is available (whether we use it or not). setup Oxide shim in insiders release add browserslist dependency use install:all script name Just using install as a script name will be called when running npm install. Now that we marked the repo as a workspace, npm install will run install in all workspaces which is... not ideal. tmp: enable insiders release in PRs Just to check if everything works before merging. Can be removed once tested. don't cache node_modules? I feel there is some catch 22 going on here. We require npm install to build the oxide/crates/node version. But we also require oxide/crates/node for the npm install becaus of the dependency: ""@tailwindcss/oxide"": ""file:oxide/creates/node"" try to use oxide/crates/node as part of the workspace let's think about this Let's try and cache the node_modules and share as much as possible. However, some scripts still need to be installed specific to the OS. Running npm install locally doesn't throw away your node_modules, so if we just cache node_modules but also run npm install that should keep as much as possible and still improve install times since node_modules is already there.

359,Improve data type analyses for arbitrary values (#9320)," improve split logic by delimiter  The original RegEx did mostly what we want, the idea is that we wanted to split by a , but one that was not within (). This is useful when you define multiple background colors for example: ```html  ``` In this case splitting by the regex would result in the proper result: js let result = [   'rgb(0,0,0)',   'rgb(255,255,255)' ] Visually, you can think of it like: ┌─[./example.html]     │ ∙ 1 │   <div class=""bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]""></div>     ·                       ──┬── ┬    ─────┬─────     ·                         │   │         ╰─────── Guarded by parens     ·                         │   ╰───────────────── We will split here     ·                         ╰───────────────────── Guarded by parens     │     └─ We properly split by , not inside a ().

542,Arbitrary variants (#8299)," register arbitrary variants  With the new addVariant API, we have a beautiful way of creating new variants. You can use it as: js addVariant('children', '& > *') Now you can use the children: variant. The API uses a & as a reference for the candidate, which means that: html children:pl-4 Will result in: css .children\:pl-4 > * { .. } Notice that the & was replaced by .children\:pl-4. We can leverage this API to implement arbitrary variants, this means that you can write those &>* (Notice that we don't have spaces) inside a variant directly. An example of this can be: ```html  A B C  Which generates the following css:css .[\&>*]\:underline > * {   text-decoration-line: underline; } ``` Now all the children of the ul will have an underline. The selector itself is a bit crazy since it contains the candidate which is the selector itself, it is just escaped.  add tests for arbitrary variants  This still requires some work to the defaultExtractor to make sure it all works with existing code.   update changelog   Fix candidate detection for arbitrary variants   Refactor   Add support for at rules   Add test for attribute selectors   Fix test   Add attribute selector support   Split top-level comma parsing into a generalized splitting routine   We can now split on any character at the top level with any nesting.

559,Fix intellisense for plugins with multiple @apply rules (#8213), Fix intellisense for plugins with multiple @apply rules  Intellisense uses expandApplyAtRules directly and doesn’t partition them. When a plugin registers components using something like ”@apply flex”: {} more than once in the same component intellisense will break. This isn’t a problem for Tailwind CSS proper because we do rule partitioning. Given that Intellisense is using it directly though we shouldn’t outright break in the face of this situation even if the result isn’t 100% accurate (the source maps won’t be correct in this case).

586,Types: allow for arbitrary theme values (for 3rd party plugins) (#7926)," allow for arbitrary configuration in the theme section  This is useful for third party plugins otherwise you will get an error.  WIP: theme() utility function code completion  This will give you code completion in the theme() function. The reason it is still a WIP is that this only works with the default config right now and not 100% sure if it is possible to define generics in JSDoc. The idea would be to: - Provide types from the default config - Provide types from the custom config (e.g.: 3rd party plugin) - Override default config types with the overrides of the user's config Right now this only provides types for the defaultConfig which might result in dropping all of this in favor of a much simpler: ts theme<D = any>(path: string, defaultValue: D) => D But this sadly doesn't give you ""nice"" auto completion. However, the default might be good enough if we don't error on for example theme('customPlugin') which is currently not the case.   update changelog   undo all theme types, and type it as theme(path: string): any   Since currently we don't want to investigate time to make the code completion perfect (because it might be even impossible to do it properly due to resolving of overrides, extend and deeply nested presets) For now we will provide a way simpler type, which is better than incorrect types.

Deduping will still allow the user to install postcss and upgrade it and Tailwind CSS will pick it up. A more permanent solution may involve hijacking require or something similar.

728,Ensure @apply works consistently with or without @layer (#6938)," partition nodes as soon as possible  Time to write another story on @apply... When we write code like this: ```css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase;   color: red; } ``` Then we create 2 Nodes in our context to keep track of. One has identifier a, the other has identifier b. However, when we have an @apply and it contains multiple declarations/atrules, then we have to split up the (aka partition) node into multiple nodes so that we can guarantee the correct expected sort order. This means that the above example technically looks like this: ```css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase; } .b {   color: red; } ``` If this was your input, then we would still have 1 node for identifier 'a', but we would have 2 nodes for identifier 'b'. As mentioned earlier, this is important to guarantee the correct order, here is an example: css .b {   @apply md:font-bold xl:font-normal; /* Here we can sort by our   internal rules. This means that the `md` comes before `xl`. */ } ... however ```css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal; / This now exists before the example below / } .b {   @apply md:font-bold; / Because we respect the order of the user's css / } ``` So to guarantee the order when doing this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal;   @apply lg:font-normal; } We also split this up into 2 nodes like this: css .b {   @apply xl:font-normal; } .b {   @apply lg:font-normal; } The tricky part is that now only 1 empty .b node exists in our context because we partitioned the orginal node into multiple nodes and moved the children to the new nodes and because they are new nodes it means that they have a different identity. This partitioning used to happen in the expandApplyAtRules code, but this is a bit too late because the context has already been filled at this time. Instead, we move the code more to the front, as if you wrote those separated blocks yourself. Now the code to inject those nodes into the context happens in a single spot instead of multiple places. Another good part about this is that we have better consistency between each layer because it turns out that these two examples generated different results... css .a {   @apply b; } .b {   @apply uppercase;   color: red; } ... is different compared to: css @tailwind components; @layer components {   .a {     @apply b;   }   .b {     @apply uppercase;     color: red;   } } Even if both a and b are being used in one of your content paths...

754,Improve collapsing of duplicate declarations (#6856)," improve collapsing of duplicate properties  In theory, we don't have to do anything because the browser is smart enough to figure everything out. However, leaving in duplicate properties is not that ideal for file size. Our previous method was pretty simple: if you see a declaration you already saw in this rule, delete the previous one and keep the current one. This works pretty well, but this gets rid of all the declarations with the same property. This is not great for overrides for older browsers. In a perfect world, we can handle this based on your target browser but this is a lot of unnecessary complexity and will slow things down performance wise. Alternative, we improved the solution by being a bit smarter: 1. Delete duplicate declarations that have the same property and value    (this will get rid of exact duplications). 2. Delete declarations with the same property and the same unit. This means that we will reduce this: css .example {   height: 50%;   height: 100px;   height: 20vh;   height: 30%;   height: 50px;   height: 30vh;   transform: var(--value);   transform: var(--value); } To: diff-css   .example { -   height: 50%;    /* Another height exists later with a `%` unit */ -   height: 100px;  /* Another height exists later with a `px` unit */ -   height: 20vh;   /* Another height exists later with a `vh` unit */     height: 30%;     height: 50px;     height: 30vh; -   transform: var(--value); /* Value is too complex, but is **exactly** the same as the one below */     transform: var(--value);   } This will reduce the values that we are 100% sure that can be safely removed. This will still result in some overrides but the browser can handle those for you.

853,Fix decoration utility ambiguity (#6217)," remove any data type for decoration color plugin  The main reason for the any type is so that we don't have to parse the value and can assume that this plugin handles ""any"" value you give it. This is useful because decoration-[var(--something)] would be correctly translated to the correct decoration property. However, we introduce another plugin with the same decoration prefix. This means that now both textDecorationColor and textDecorationThickness have the same base utility name: decoration.  textDecorationColor had ['color', 'any'] textDecorationThickness had ['length', 'percentage']  This means that 3px fit both in the length data type of the textDecorationThickness plugin and in the any data type of the textDecorationColor plugin. Removing the any fixes this. TL;DR: Only have any when there are no conflicting utility names.  remove utility that doesn't generate css  Having decoration-[var(--abc)] is ambiguous because there are multiple plugins that have a decoration utility name. In order for this to work you have to prefix it with the type: decoration-[color:var(--abc)] which is already tested in this file.",Fix decoration utility ambiguity (#6217),"remove any data type for decoration color plugin The main reason for the any type is so that we don't have to parse the value and can assume that this plugin handles ""any"" value you give it.

905,Improve addVariant API (#5809)," fix incorrect comment  Probably messed this up in another PR, so just a bit of cleaning.  implement a formatVariantSelector function  This will be used to eventually simplify the addVariant API. The idea is that it can take a list of strings that define a certain format. Then it squashes everything to a single format how you would expect it. E.g.: Input:   - '&:hover'   - '&:focus'   - '.dark &'   - ':merge(.group):hover &'   - ':merge(.group):focus &' Output:   - ':merge(.group):focus:hover .dark &:focus:hover' The API here is:   - &, this means ""The parent"" or ""The previous selector"" (you can     think of it like if you are using nested selectors)   - :merge(.group), this means insert a .group if it doesn't exist     yet, but if it does exist already, then merge the new value with the     old value. This allows us to merge group-focus, group-hover into a     single .group:focus:hover ...   add new format, withRule and wrap API for addVariant   implement backwards compatibility   This will ensure that the backwards compatibility for modifySelectors and direct mutations to the container will still work. We will try to capture the changes made to the rule.selector, we will also ""backup"" the existing selector. This allows us to diff the old and new selectors and determine what actually happened. Once we know this, we can restore the selector to the ""old"" selector and add the diffed string e.g.: .foo &, to the collectedFormats as if you called format() directly. This is a bunch of extra work, but it allows us to be backwards compatible. In the future we could also warn if you are using modifySelectors, but it is going to be a little bit tricky, because usually that's implemented by plugin authors and therefore you don't have direct control over this. Maybe we can figure out the plugin this is used in and change the warning somehow?  fix incorrect test  This was clearly a bug, keyframes should not include escaped variants at all. The reason this is here in the first place is because the nodes in a keyframe are also ""rule"" nodes.  swap the order of pseudo states  The current implementation had a strange side effect, that resulted in incorrect class definitions. When you are combining the :hover and :focus event, then there is no difference between :hover:focus and :focus:hover. However, when you use :hover::file-selector-button or ::file-selector-button:hover, then there is a big difference. In the first place, you can hover over the full file input to apply changes to the File selector button. In the second scenario you have to hover over the File selector button itself to apply changes. You can think of it as function calls: - focus(hover(text-center)) What you would expect is something like this: .focus\:hover\:text-center:hover:focus, where hover is on the inside, and focus is on the outside. However in the current implementation this is implemented as .focus\:hover\:text-cener:focus:hover   add more variant tests for the new API   update parallel variants tests to make use of new API   implement core variants with new API   simplify/cleanup existing plugin utils   We can get rid of this because we drastically simplified the new addVariant API.  add addVariant shorthand signature  The current API looks like this: ```js addVariant('name', ({ format, wrap }) => {   // Wrap in an atRule   wrap(postcss.atRule({ name: 'media', params: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' })) // ""Mutate"" the selector, for example prepend .dark   format('.dark &') }) ``` It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ format }) => format('.dark &')) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '.dark &') It is also pretty common to have this: js addVariant('name', ({ wrap }) => wrap(postcss.atRule({ name: 'media', params: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' }))) So we simplified this to: js addVariant('name', '@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')  improve fontVariantNumeric implementation  We will use @defaults, so that only the resets are injected for the utilities we actually use.   fix typo   allow for nested addVariant shorthand   This will allow to write something like: js addVariant('name', `   @supports (hover: hover) {     @media (print) {       &:hover     }   } `) // Or as a one-liner addVariant('name', '@supports (hover: hover) { @media (print) { &:hover } }')  update changelog",Improve addVariant API (#5809),"fix incorrect comment Probably messed this up in another PR, so just a bit of cleaning. implement a formatVariantSelector function This will be used to eventually simplify the addVariant API.

For example: bg-[#0088cc]      -> This is a `color`  -> `background-color` bg-[url('...')]   -> This is a `url`    -> `background-image` If you are using css variables, then there is no way of knowing which type it is referring to, in that case you can be explicit: bg-[color:var(--value)]   -> This is a `color`  -> `background-color` bg-[url:var(--value)]     -> This is a `url`    -> `background-image` When you explicitly pass a data type, then we bypass the type system and assume you are right. This is nice in a way because now we don't have to run all of the guessing type code. On the other hand, you can introduce runtime issues that we are not able to detect: ``` :root {   --value: 12px; } / Later... / bg-[color:var(--value)] -> Assumes color -> eventually -> background-color: 12px ```  add a bunch of new tests for advanced arbitrary values",Improve arbitrary value support (#5568),"simplify inset plugin run prettier on stub file simplify align utility improve arbitrary support for outline This will allow us to use outline-[OUTLINE,OPTIONAL_OFFSET] Input: html outline-[2px_solid_black] Output: css .outline-[2px_solid_black] {   outline: 2px solid black;   outline-offset: 0; } Input: html outline-[2px_solid_black,2px] Output: css .outline-[2px_solid_black\2c 2px] {   outline: 2px solid black;   outline-offset: 2px; } remove default type simplify createUtilityPlugin, use types directly find first matching type when coercing the value introduce css data types Ref: link These data types will be used to ""guess"" the type of an arbitrary value if there is some ambiguity going on.

1047,Support @apply for classes outside of a @layer (#5378),"  support @apply for classes outside of a @layer   Add failing test for respecting source order   sort rules when using @apply   The layer was not taken into account yet when we resolved the rules from the applyCache. This is because we set the classCache to the matches inside of the generateRules function. You can think of them as ""raw"" rules I guess. However, it is later in that function that we apply the layerOrder to the sort. This does mean that when you @apply font-bold text-red-500 that the rules inside the .target {} will be in order of the ""normal"" css as well.

This way we make the cloning of the rule lazy and only when we use this exact rule. There is an additional performace ""issue"" though: When we read the same rule multiple times, it will clone every time you read from that object. We could add additional memoization stuff, but so far it doesn't seem to be the bottleneck. Therefore I've added a perf todo just to leave a mark when this becomes the bottleneck.",make the cloning of the rule in the lookup table lazy,"We create a big lookup table so that we can lookup the nodes by its utilityName.

2018,re-use classNameParser,We were re-creating the classNameParser inside the loop. Since that code is all pretty pure we can hoist it so that we don't have to recreate that parser all the time.,re-use classNameParser,We were re-creating the classNameParser inside the loop.

2019,bail out of the applyComplexClasses when it is not needed,There is no need in re-compiling tailwind or building expensive lookupt tables when it turns out that we don't even need it. We have a small overhead by walking the tree to check if @apply exists. However this outweighs the slowness of re-generating tailwind + expensive lookup tables.,bail out of the applyComplexClasses when it is not needed,There is no need in re-compiling tailwind or building expensive lookupt tables when it turns out that we don't even need it.

3262,Require plugin authors to manually escape variants,"Not 100% convinced this is a net positive change, but I regret not having done things this way at the beginning. In 0.x, we pass the separator and className values already escaped, so : comes through as \: for example, and w-1/2 comes through as w-1\/2. At first this sounds fine, less work for the plugin author right? But CSS escaping rules are kind of complicated and you have to escape characters differently depending on whether or not they are at the start of an identifier. For example, it's totally fine for a class to contain a zero (0 ), but it can't start with a zero. For a class to start with a zero, it needs to be escaped like this: \30 This means that as a general rule, trying to escape the individual segments of a class separately is a bad idea — you should escape the class as a whole so only the necessary escaping is applied. We break this rule when we pre-escape the separator and className for plugin authors who use the modifySelectors function. We already require users to manually escape class names when they are using addUtilities or addComponents, so to me it feels more consistent for things to work this way and it's how they should have worked from day one. Basically this code: js function({ addVariant }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return `.first-child${separator}${className}:first-child`     })   }) }, ...would need to be re-written like this if I merge this change: js function({ addVariant, e }) {   addVariant('first-child', ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {     modifySelectors(({ className }) => {       return `.${e(`first-child${separator}${className}`)}:first-child`     })   }) }, Although I think this is the right way for this to work, I hesitate because it's a breaking change that makes any variant plugins authored for 0.x incompatible with 1.x. It's an easy fix on the plugin author's part, but it's still annoying. I'm leaning towards merging so I don't regret this even more later when the plugin ecosystem is a lot bigger.
