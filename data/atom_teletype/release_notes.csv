9,"With Teletype 0.10.0, you'll now enjoy a streamlined view of your collaborators' avatars inside the editor. (https://github.com/atom/teletype/pull/332)
All avatars now appear in the bottom right corner. Additionally, you'll now see a collaborator's avatar even when they switch their focus to something outside the portal. For example, if a guest starts editing a file that's not associated with the portal, you'll continue to see the guest's avatar, but it will have a reduced opacity to indicate reduced portal activity from that guest.
