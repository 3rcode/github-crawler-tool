The rest of the existing RFC involves replacing the existing use of portal IDs with more user-friendly portal URLs. Support for portal URLs shipped today in Teletype 0.11. With that in mind, this commit splits the existing RFC into two separate RFCs:  RFC-003 covers the introduction of portal URLs, and that RFC has a status of ""Implemented"" RFC-004 contains the original ""buddy list"" proposal. That RFC still has a status of ""Proposed"". Future commits will update that proposal to incorporate the review feedback provided in #344.",0

Don't relay selections that are destroyed when creation event is emitted,0.28117502,Fix bug that would occasionally cause participants to see incorrectly-positioned cursors for other participants (https://github.com/atom/teletype/pull/326),"This is a workaround to a bug that exists in core where, if a marker is destroyed during the handling of a onDidCreateMarker event, subsequent observers are still notified of the creation event, even though the marker is already destroyed. This happens frequently when two selections overlap, whereby Atom merges the selections, destroying the most recent one inside of an onDidCreateMarker event handler. This should really be fixed in core (i.e. when iterating over observers to notify them of marker creation, if any observer causes the marker to be destroyed, don't notify the remaining observers). In the meantime this feels like a reasonable workaround for Teletype, and will prevent participants from seeing spurious cursors when another participant creates selections that end up overlapping with each other.

Simplify relaying of active editor changes,0.3622651,"With Teletype 0.3.0, you can now share and edit multiple files simultaneously during your real-time coding sessions. (#262)","Instead of using removeEditorProxy to understand whether an editor was removed manually or not from a guest portal, we are moving the code that manages the destruction of an editor from EditorBinding to GuestPortalBinding. This allows to understand the order in which the editor and the editor proxy destruction events occur. If the former occurs before the latter, it means that the user has manually destroyed the editor. If the events occur in the opposite order, it means that the host has destroyed the editor. These events are then used to determine whether the tether should be detached after the active pane item changes. This refactoring will pave the way to remove addEditorProxy and removeEditorProxy.",0

Change strategy to determine if editor was manually destroyed,0.24953948,Offer to reload the package when initialization fails due to network connectivity issues (#287),"This fixes a regression introduced in the previous commit that was causing notification to not appear when host closed the portal or lost the connection. Specifically, these notifications were not appearing because GuestPortalBinding interpreted closing remote tabs as being a user-initiated action, instead of as a result of the host tearing down their portal. Thus, when the last tab was being closed the guest would mistakenly leave the portal instead of being kicked out of it. With this commit we rely on when editorBinding.onDidDispose is fired to determine if the editor was destroyed manually or by the host. In particular, if onDidDispose is called before actually destroying the pane item associated with the editor, it means that EditorProxy.dispose was called first and the host wanted to tear down that particular editor. Otherwise, if we haven't processed the binding onDidDispose event when an editor is destroyed it means the editor was destroyed by the user.",0

Prior to this change, if the guest closes the last remote editor, the guest would be in limbo: they're still in the portal, but they don't see any remote editors. Their only remedy was to manually leave and re-join the portal. In an upcoming release, we hope to integrate the guest's fuzzy finder with the portal. Once that functionality is in place: - If the guest closes the last remote editor, the guest could use the   fuzzy finder to open any of the available remote editors, thus   preventing the limbo state described above - Because of this, we could remove the behavior implemented in this   commit (i.e., we would no longer have to leave the portal when the   guest closes the last remote editor)",0

Relay active editor changes only if they're manually initiated by users,0.30483812,Update guest workspaces when host renames a shared file (https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/147),"This prevents a bug that was previously causing followers to disconnect their tether when the leader rapidly switched among tabs and destroyed them before followers had the chance to download the remote editors/buffers associated with them. In particular, followers would receive two messages indicating that the leader wanted to switch to a new tab and that they wanted to close the previous one. When trying to download the editor associated with the new tab, the guest would find out that such editor did not exist anymore and, therefore, would skip that message and only process the second message indicating that the old editor needed to be removed. In doing so, it would remove the old editor from the workspace and call portal.activateEditorProxy with the editor proxy associated with the newly active pane item in the workspace. In turn, this would cause the follower to disconnect their tether, even if the two peers did not really want to start browsing tabs on their own. With this commit we are explicitly preventing this problem from happening by not relaying active editor changes to portal when such changes happen as a result of an update to the workspace caused by the leader while the tether is retracted.",0

While I think this should be solved in text-buffer, it's also true that we are going to move away from non-batched events pretty soon (and, long-term, onDidChange should be deprecated as well).
