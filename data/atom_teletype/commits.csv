225,Don't relay selections that are destroyed when creation event is emitted,"This is a workaround to a bug that exists in core where, if a marker is destroyed during the handling of a onDidCreateMarker event, subsequent observers are still notified of the creation event, even though the marker is already destroyed. This happens frequently when two selections overlap, whereby Atom merges the selections, destroying the most recent one inside of an onDidCreateMarker event handler. This should really be fixed in core (i.e. when iterating over observers to notify them of marker creation, if any observer causes the marker to be destroyed, don't notify the remaining observers). In the meantime this feels like a reasonable workaround for Teletype, and will prevent participants from seeing spurious cursors when another participant creates selections that end up overlapping with each other.

This allows to understand the order in which the editor and the editor proxy destruction events occur. If the former occurs before the latter, it means that the user has manually destroyed the editor. If the events occur in the opposite order, it means that the host has destroyed the editor.

Thus, when the last tab was being closed the guest would mistakenly leave the portal instead of being kicked out of it. With this commit we rely on when editorBinding.onDidDispose is fired to determine if the editor was destroyed manually or by the host. In particular, if onDidDispose is called before actually destroying the pane item associated with the editor, it means that EditorProxy.dispose was called first and the host wanted to tear down that particular editor.

In particular, followers would receive two messages indicating that the leader wanted to switch to a new tab and that they wanted to close the previous one. When trying to download the editor associated with the new tab, the guest would find out that such editor did not exist anymore and, therefore, would skip that message and only process the second message indicating that the old editor needed to be removed. In doing so, it would remove the old editor from the workspace and call portal.activateEditorProxy with the editor proxy associated with the newly active pane item in the workspace. In turn, this would cause the follower to disconnect their tether, even if the two peers did not really want to start browsing tabs on their own. With this commit we are explicitly preventing this problem from happening by not relaying active editor changes to portal when such changes happen as a result of an update to the workspace caused by the leader while the tether is retracted.",Relay active editor changes only if they're manually initiated by users,"This prevents a bug that was previously causing followers to disconnect their tether when the leader rapidly switched among tabs and destroyed them before followers had the chance to download the remote editors/buffers associated with them.

987,Don't relay empty changes to SharedBuffer,"After implementing 2ecf5cb, we started observing Cannot read property opId of undefined exceptions.
