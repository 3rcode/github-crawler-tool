For a smooth upgrade, make sure to update to the latest Probot v10 version first (npm install probot@10), run your tests, and address all deprecation messages. Nearly all removed APIs have previously been deprecated.

deprecated context.octokit.* have been removed via @octokit/plugin-rest-endpoint-methods v4
probot.server property removed. Build your own server instead using import { Server } from ""probot""
probot.load() is now asynchronous and no longer returns the instance
express-async-errors is no longer used.
Probot constructor parameter no longer supported in createNodeMiddleware(app, { Probot }). Pass a probot instance instead: createNodeMiddleware(app, { probot })
getOptions() has been removed. Use { probot: createProbot() } instead
probot.load(appFn) no longer accepts appFn to be a path string. Pass the actual function instead.
probot.setup() removed. Use the new Server class instead:

```js
  const { Server, Probot } = require(""probot"")
  const server = new Server({
    // optional:
    host,
    port,
    webhookPath,
    webhookProxy,

  })
// load probot app function
  await server.load((app) => {})
// start listening to requests
  await server.start()
  // stop server with: await server.stop()
  ```

@octokit/rest has been updated from v16 to v17. See release notes. Important: If you currently mocked context.github.* methods in your test, replace these with http mocks using nock instead, otherwise your tests will create methods that no longer exist and you will see errors in production although your tests passed. See https://github.com/wip/app/pull/238 for an example
URL parameters are now always encoded when using context.github.* methods. For example, if you use context.github.repos.getContent( owner, repo, path ) make sure to not encode the value for path. Also if you were mocking http requests in your tests, replace e.g. repos/octocat/hello-world/contents/.github/config.yml with repos/octocat/hello-world/contents/.github%2Fconfig.yml
require Node 10.21+
Logging: an object with extra information must be passed as first argument. Passing it as last argument is no longer supported.

before
js
  context.log.info('something happened', {extra: 'info'})
after
js
  context.log.info({extra: 'info'}, 'something happened')

The logging output changed. Before, probot used bunyan with all kind of hacks and customizations for its log output. Now we use pino. We still do the formatting and sending errors to Sentry in the same process, but the logic is now encapsulated in @probot/pino. We might decouple it in future as part of making Probot more suitable for serverless/function environments
context.issue() now returns .issue_number instead of .number. Use context.pullRequest() for octokit.pulls.* method calls.
registry_package event was renamed to package
The probot package no longer exports Octokit. Use ProbotOctokit instead.

js
  const { ProbotOctokit, ProbotOctokitCore } = require('probot')
- Probot no longer accepts options.throttlingOptions. In order to disable throttling for testing, set options.Octokit to ProbotOctokit.defaults({ retry: { enabled: false }, throttle: { enabled: false } }):

context.github.query(): Changes in errors thrown due to GraphQL errors
error.name is now GraphqlError, was GraphQLQueryError
error.query is now error.request.query
preview headers that are not required to use an API are no longer set automatically. Set using {headers: { accept: '<preview header here>'}
.gitdata.getTags() has been removed. Use .git.listRefs({namespace: tags}) instead
Methods for undocumented endpoints have been removed.
Instead of octokit.users.getById({id}) use octokit.request('GET /user/:id', {id})
Instead of octokit.repos.getById({id}) use octokit.request('GET /repositories/:id', {id})
octokit.enterprise.* methods have been removed. Use your own @ocotkit/rest instance and install the @octokit/enterprise-rest plugin
octokit.issues.addLabels sends labels parameter with ""labels"" namespace instead of sending the array in the request body root. This is not supported by GitHub Enterprise 2.15 or older. You have several options.

Pagination: the .paginate API from @octokit/rest.js is now used
.paginate(options, mapFn) now accepts the request options, just like ocotkit.request.
.paginate.iterator(options) allows for async iteration.
Custom requests using octokit.request & octokit.request.endpoint.
Improved Typescript definitions for context.github
new github.paginate API, github.paginate.iterator() (153a3fa)
new throttling & automated retries (6f06f82)

Bug Fixes

logging: error.status is the new error.code. The old error.status is no more (3b3d656)
make .issues.addLabels() compatible with current GHE versions (d41c422)

Build System

package: @octokit/rest v16, @octokit/graphql, octokit-pagination-methods (a8f39d0)
","BREAKING CHANGES
context.github.query(): Changes in errors thrown due to GraphQL errors
error.name is now GraphqlError, was GraphQLQueryError
error.query is now error.request.query
all previously deprecated methods have been removed
preview headers that are not required to use an API are no longer set automatically. Set using {headers: { accept: ''}
.gitdata.getTags() has been removed. Use .gitdata.listRefs({namespace: tags}) instead
Methods for undocumented endpoints have been removed.
Instead of octokit.users.getById({id}) use octokit.request('GET /user/:id', {id})
Instead of octokit.repos.getById({id}) use octokit.request('GET /repositories/:id', {id})
octokit.enterprise.* methods have been removed. Use your own @ocotkit/rest instance and install the @octokit/enterprise-rest plugin
octokit.issues.addLabels sends labels parameter with ""labels"" namespace instead of sending the array in the request body root. This is not supported by GitHub Enterprise 2.15 or older. You have several options.
Use the @octokit/enterprise-compatibility plugin
Use the @octokit/enterprise-rest plugin loading all routes for the GHE version you want to support
Use octokit.request() directly:
js
octokit.request('/repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/labels', {
  owner,
  repo,
  number,
  data: ['label1', 'label2']
})
* The milestone parameter is no longer validated using a regex as it cannot be derived from octokit/routes
* error.status is now the response status code number. The status text is no longer returned
Deprecations
context.github.query() is now context.github.graphql()
context.github.query(query, variables, headers) is now context.github.graphql(query, options). options.headers is passed as headers. Other options are passed as variables, with the exception of method, baseUrl, url, headers, request, and query.
context.github.paginate(promise, mapFn) is now context.github.paginate(requestOptions, mapFn). Example:
Before
js
  const allIssues = await context.github.paginate(
    context.github.issues.getAll(context.repo())
  )
After
js
  const allIssues = await context.github.paginate(
    context.github.issues.getAll.endpoint.merge(context.repo())
  )

Probot has been rewritten in TypeScript. Overall, you should see no significant difference between 6.2.0 and 7.0.0 and you can continue writing your apps in plain ol' JavaScript if you'd like. Writing Probot apps in TypeScript is still experimental, but if you'd like to help us improve the experience, please check out https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/512 and open pull requests to improve TypeScript support.

Fix path to GraphQL API when using GitHub Enterprise. Now you can use Probot to make GraphQL requests against your GitHub Enterprise instance (#580)


Fix deprecation warning from Octokit.js for response.meta (#550)


Migrating from 6 to 7
If you're using the probot run command, then there should only be one major breaking change for your test suite. createRobot is now a class, Application:
```js
// probot@6.x.x
const { createRobot } = require('probot')
const robot = createRobot()
// probot@7.0.0
const { Application } = require('probot')
const app = new Application()
```
You can also use app.load(myProbotApp) instead of myProbotApp(robot), which is common in tests.","Improvements

The new webhook proxy introduced in 4.0 is now the default (#391). Support for localtunnel has been removed and will no longer work in development. To update your existing Probot app to use the new webhook proxy in development:


Go to smee.io and click Start a new channel. Set WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL in your .env to the URL that you are redirected to.

Update your GitHub App to deliver webhooks to the webhook proxy URL.
Run $ npm install --save-dev smee-client to install the new client
Run $ npm uninstall localtunnel to remove the old client
Run $ npm start and your app should work just like it did before! 🎉 

See the development docs for more information. If you still want to use localtunnel, you can install it manually and run lt --port 3000.
Enhancements

Properly handle async errors in express. (#384)
Add DISABLE_STATS option to disable the /probot/stats endpoint that is available by default. For popular apps, this endpoint can be expensive to generate. (#392)
