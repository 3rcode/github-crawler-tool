113,"We made it to beta, folks! 🎉
SB7 overhauls our build architecture, modernizes ESM output, promotes Vite to a first-class peer to Webpack, rethinks our Docs addon, cleans up the UI, and contains hundreds of improvements at every level of the stack. We've been sharing some of these changes on the Storybook blog and will share more over the coming weeks.
Beta means that we don't have any more major changes on the radar for 7.0 and it's mostly stabilization from here on out. The core team is doing some basic testing now, and once we have a good QA plan, we'd love your help to make that happen. Please keep an eye out on the blog and on our Twitter or Mastodon (coming soon!) or Discord if you're interested in helping.

App for Mithril #3244
Feature request: adding aXe configuration for a11y addon #3285
files knob #2860

Addon Storysource typescript support #3253
addon-options: Make shortcuts in storybook optional #3237
Add parameters to stories in the story store, and render them in app layers #2679
Add min, value, and max labels to range knob #3128
viewport-addon: Make the addon configurable #3099
Bind window access if window is defined; add addons channel access too #3243

Bug Fixes

Breaking Changes
All storybook apps are migrated to webpack 4 #3148. This is a breaking change only if you use a custom webpack config. Your webpack 2/3 based config may still work (especialy if it uses no plugins), but its not guaranteed.
Features
Viewport-addon Allow setting callback to be called whenever viewport changes #3283
App for Mithril #3244
Feature request: adding aXe configuration for a11y addon #3285
files knob #2860
Using svg-url-loader for webpack configs that accept svgs #3221
Addon Storysource typescript support #3253
addon-options: Make shortcuts in storybook optional #3237
Add parameters to stories in the story store, and render them in app layers #2679
Add min, value, and max labels to range knob #3128
viewport-addon: Make the addon configurable #3099
Bind window access if window is defined; add addons channel access too #3243
Bug Fixes
Update react-native symlink resolving and add support for flow #3306
[Addon-storyshots] Remove default options on ""goto"" call #3298
Remove onDeviceUI animation to support Detox screenshots #3272
Angular: use resolveLoader from cliCommonConfig #3251
Maintenance
Create CODEOWNERS from git history #3296
Close inactive issues in 30 days #3273
Refactor all startup code into @storybook/core also #3259
Update ISSUE_TEMPLATE to help define work to be done #3257
