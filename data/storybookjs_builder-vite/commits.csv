5,Inject mdx compiler for mdx1 (#556),"fixes https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/issues/557 I found that mdx was not working correctly here, and @valentinpalkovic realized my fallback in Storybook 7 wasn't either (https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/20823).  It was because we used to inject the mdx compiler into the source code that we get back from the @storybook/mdx1-csf compiler, but we lost that in https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/pull/548/files#diff-f2dfc4dfa9074d77a728a88e6629a1d66be8a0765cab8562526cd00fbae910e5L6.  This re-introduces it, with a bit better of a guarantee that the correct version is going to be loaded, by starting from inside @storybook/mdx1-csf. I've also pinned mdx1-csf here, in case the import is moved from the loader to the compiler, as @shilman has suggested doing.

26,Move examples out of workspaces (#502),"We sometimes have trouble with our examples because of hoisting issues. So, instead of using a monorepo, this PR would turn this repo into a multi-project repo, with no top-level package.json, and instead each example would be stand-alone, and so would packages/builder-vite. I'm not positive this is the way to go, but it did already suss out a few issues with missing dependencies in both the projects as well as the builder-vite itself. One thing that's a bit wonky is that since the builder-vite has a completely different node_modules, it can't use any of the packages that are installed in the example, like preact and the vite preact plugin in the preact example. I added them as dev deps to the builder, which works fine I think.

It seems that whereas rollup only uses the mappings, I guess that vite/esbuild uses the sources field of the sourcemap as well, and without passing the source option to MagicString's generateMap, we were losing the connection.  So, this adds the id as the source, and also enables hires (high resolution) so that columns are correct and not just lines (useful for code coverage, for example). I also added MagicString to some of our other plugins which weren't using it. The most obvious changes are in the react and svelte projects.  Vue is a bit improved, but we're still losing the story file sourcemaps for some reason. To test, fire up an example project (in dev especially, but good to check prod builds too), look in the sources tab in devtools, and poke around, looking for sourcemapped versions of the files.

74,Handle new versions of vite-plugin-svelte (#382),"Fixes https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/issues/381 There have been two changes in @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte that cause problems for us, which this PR addresses:   https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fvite-plugin-svelte%401.0.0-next.42 started to merge the svelte.config.js file by default, which may not be what storybook users want / expect, since their production config may be different from the storybook config (same reason we don't automatically merge vite.config.js).  With the changes here, the configFile option in svelteOptions can still be set to true or to a specific file, if desired.   https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fvite-plugin-svelte%401.0.0-next.43 began returning an array of plugins rather than just a single one.  This would normally be fine, except that we hack around with the plugin to create two separate ones, with different names, to avoid HMR in story files.  So, this PR checks to see if the result is an array or not, and reacts accordingly.  Note, I'm throwing away the inspector for story files.  This might be a problem, but until we hear about it, I think this'll be fine.  The inspector is still pretty experimental anyway, from what I can tell.   To test, you can revert the changes I've made in vite-config.ts, and you'll see that the svelte example breaks (I updated the svelte plugin in it).  With the changes, it builds successfully.

One bummer is that MDX files also no longer HMR, though technically they could.

While I still think it would be great to avoid including deps in our optimizeDeps.include as much as we can, it turns out that it's still necessary for a few reasons.   1) If an addon (like storybook-dark-mode) publishes a cjs package that require()s from a storybook package that has been excluded from optimization, then esbuild seems to not replace that require at build time as it normally would.   Some background: esbuild's bundler emulates a CommonJS environment. The bundling process replaces the literal syntax require() with the referenced module at compile-time.   (https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#01229) This results in the situation outlined in #327. 2) Even after I removed all the packages from exclude, if I didn't add them back to the include list, there were multiple page refreshes while the app booted the first time, while vite found new deps and reloaded the page.  That would only happen once until the cache was populated, which isn't horrible, but it's not a great experience either. 3) Lastly, if I tried to keep the logic which prevented optimizing the storybook framework package, I ended up with react hook warnings, which usually means that multiple versions of react are loaded in the page.  That was the final straw which made me decide to completely revert the PR and go back to what we had before.  When I did that, my storybook worked just fine.

118,Support React 18 (#320),"An exciting PR has been merged and released in 6.5.0-alpha.58 that adds storybook support for React 18.  However, it currently breaks in the vite-builder test because of an import() of the new react-dom/client, which only exists in react 18.  Due to https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/6007, we have to do a little bit of trickery to stop vite from erroring out.  The approach I'm taking here is: 1) Rewriting the import of react-dom/client to a dummy file if it can't be require.resolve()ed.  This fixes the problem in production builds. 2) Additionally, adding react-dom/client to the list of optimizeDeps.exclude if the framework is react and the package can't be required.  This is necessary to prevent vite from trying to pre-bundle, and throwing errors in dev. This PR also updates the examples to the new 6.5.0-alpha.58 version of storybook, which includes the PR mentioned above, so that it can be tested in our react examples, and it adds a new react-18 example as well.",Support React 18 (#320),"An exciting PR has been merged and released in 6.5.0-alpha.58 that adds storybook support for React 18.

119,Check for explicit typescript dep for react-docgen (#313),"Fixes #312. Previously, we'd just look to see if typescript was in the project at all, but turns out that it can be included as a peer dependency of some storybook dependencies. So, this tightens the check a bit, to search the package.json for typescript in either devDependencies or dependencies (in case someone forgot to use --save-dev I guess).   To verify, I removed the typescript config from our react example (that should have been a clue to me this was broken, I assumed it was due to our monorepo), and I also checked that vite:react-docgen-typescript is still being used in our react-ts example.",Check for explicit typescript dep for react-docgen (#313),"Fixes #312.

Instead of using a babel transform, this creates a vite plugin, similar to the vue-docgen plugin, but based on the babel-plugin-react-docgen.  This gives us the chance to rely directly on react-docgen, without needing another package in between, and it avoids being accidentally overwritten if users replace our @vitejs/plugin-react with their own config. This new vite plugin is not configurable like the babel plugin is, but I'm not certain those configurations are necessary in the first place.  If we hear from users that it's something they need, we can find a way to make them customizable, but I prefer to avoid extra options if possible. This version does not create a global list of all the docs, like the babel plugin does (DOC_GEN_COLLECTION_NAME).  I looked through the storybook source, and it doesn't seem like anything still relies on it, so I think it's just a legacy detail for now that we can probably avoid supporting.

Fixed: the config.build property may be undefined Simplify JSDoc Created TODO: Maybe convert injectExportOrderPlugin to function that returns object, and run await init; once and then call parse() without await, instead of calling await parse() every time. Fixed rare case if the envPrefix is undefined in stringifyProcessEnvs() function Reorder imports in build.ts and vite-server.ts Added check for a case if the StoriesEntry is object in functions: generateImportFnScriptCode(); generateIframeScriptCode(); getOptimizeDeps(). Created listStories() function and removed duplicated code."
