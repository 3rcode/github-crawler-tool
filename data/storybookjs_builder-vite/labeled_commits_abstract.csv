It was because we used to inject the mdx compiler into the source code that we get back from the @storybook/mdx1-csf compiler, but we lost that in link.  This re-introduces it, with a bit better of a guarantee that the correct version is going to be loaded, by starting from inside @storybook/mdx1-csf. I've also pinned mdx1-csf here, in case the import is moved from the loader to the compiler, as @shilman has suggested doing.  We'll need to adjust this if that happens.",0

So, we no longer need to include @vitejs/plugin-react in all projects, and react projects will need to make sure it's installed.  That makes this a breaking change.

So, instead of using a monorepo, this PR would turn this repo into a multi-project repo, with no top-level package.json, and instead each example would be stand-alone, and so would packages/builder-vite. I'm not positive this is the way to go, but it did already suss out a few issues with missing dependencies in both the projects as well as the builder-vite itself. One thing that's a bit wonky is that since the builder-vite has a completely different node_modules, it can't use any of the packages that are installed in the example, like preact and the vite preact plugin in the preact example. I added them as dev deps to the builder, which works fine I think. It's a downside, but on the other hand it makes these deps a little bit explicit without bloating the dependencies for users.",0

It seems that whereas rollup only uses the mappings, I guess that vite/esbuild uses the sources field of the sourcemap as well, and without passing the source option to MagicString's generateMap, we were losing the connection.  So, this adds the id as the source, and also enables hires (high resolution) so that columns are correct and not just lines (useful for code coverage, for example). I also added MagicString to some of our other plugins which weren't using it. The most obvious changes are in the react and svelte projects.  Vue is a bit improved, but we're still losing the story file sourcemaps for some reason. To test, fire up an example project (in dev especially, but good to check prod builds too), look in the sources tab in devtools, and poke around, looking for sourcemapped versions of the files.  You should see them in this branch, but not nearly as many, if any, in main.",0

74,Add Svelte example,0.5541618,Apply svelteOptions correctly by @IanVS in link,"Fixes link There have been two changes in @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte that cause problems for us, which this PR addresses: link started to merge the svelte.config.js file by default, which may not be what storybook users want / expect, since their production config may be different from the storybook config (same reason we don't automatically merge vite.config.js).  With the changes here, the configFile option in svelteOptions can still be set to true or to a specific file, if desired. link began returning an array of plugins rather than just a single one.  This would normally be fine, except that we hack around with the plugin to create two separate ones, with different names, to avoid HMR in story files.  So, this PR checks to see if the result is an array or not, and reacts accordingly.  Note, I'm throwing away the inspector for story files.  This might be a problem, but until we hear about it, I think this'll be fine.  The inspector is still pretty experimental anyway, from what I can tell. To test, you can revert the changes I've made in vite-config.ts, and you'll see that the svelte example breaks (I updated the svelte plugin in it).  With the changes, it builds successfully. This also enables the use of the new experimental inspection plugin. To enable this feature, be sure you have @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte version 1.0.0-next.43 or higher, then add the following to your svelteOptions in .storybook/main.js: js module.exports = {   // ... rest of config   framework: '@storybook/svelte',   svelteOptions: {     preprocess: preprocess(),     experimental: { inspector: true }, // <-- this line   }, }; Then, when the storybook opens, focus a story iframe and press cmd+shift (mac) or ctrl+shift (windows) to activate.",0

When using storyStoreV7, we configure HMR to swap out the importFn when stories change.  However, this breaks web-components projects (see link). So, instead, this change checks if the framework is web-components and if so, refreshes the page instead of performing an HMR.  It's still pretty quick, and not a full page reload. You can test this out by starting up our lit-ts example (which I've configured to use storyStoreV7 now), open the story, and save the component or story file.  It shouldn't blow up anymore. One bummer is that MDX files also no longer HMR, though technically they could.  But I can't find a way to detect which part of the importFn changed, in order to determine whether to HMR or not, and it's safer to just avoid it for all stories when using web-components.",1

I realized we should do this when working on converting a large project over to use the vite builder as an experiment, and found that it took ~20 minutes to load the first storybook page after the browser opened.  After digging, I found that most of this time was spent processing files that were in other parts of the monorepo, like icons, which did not need docgen info.  After making the changes in this PR, the time was reduced to less than 2 minutes on a cold start.  The number of processed files dropped from 1668 to 958.  And the time drops to 20 seconds for a cold boot with storyStoreV7 (processes 39 files). This is configurable, although it's not super-straightforward.  For example: js async viteFinal(config) {     config.plugins = [       require('@storybook/builder-vite/dist/plugins/react-docgen').reactDocgen({         exclude: [/^..\//, /node_modules/],         include: /.(jsx?)$/,       }),       ...config.plugins.filter((plugin) => plugin?.name !== 'react-docgen'),     ];     return config; } Note that react-docgen needs to happen before the @vitejs/plugin-react plugins, which is why it's above the spread of the rest of the plugins in this example.",1

While I still think it would be great to avoid including deps in our optimizeDeps.include as much as we can, it turns out that it's still necessary for a few reasons. 1) If an addon (like storybook-dark-mode) publishes a cjs package that require()s from a storybook package that has been excluded from optimization, then esbuild seems to not replace that require at build time as it normally would.  Some background: esbuild's bundler emulates a CommonJS environment. The bundling process replaces the literal syntax require() with the referenced module at compile-time.  (link) This results in the situation outlined in #327. 2) Even after I removed all the packages from exclude, if I didn't add them back to the include list, there were multiple page refreshes while the app booted the first time, while vite found new deps and reloaded the page.  That would only happen once until the cache was populated, which isn't horrible, but it's not a great experience either. 3) Lastly, if I tried to keep the logic which prevented optimizing the storybook framework package, I ended up with react hook warnings, which usually means that multiple versions of react are loaded in the page.  That was the final straw which made me decide to completely revert the PR and go back to what we had before.  When I did that, my storybook worked just fine. I think we can take another stab at avoiding optimization another time, but we've already made a lot of changes to this package lately and it doesn't seem to be causing problems like I initially suspected in link.",1

Furthermore, after storybook 6.5.0-alpha.58, we can exclude the framework packages from pre-bundling also, but in versions earlier than that, we do need to pre-bundle.  So I added a dependency on semver, to compare the storybook framework's version from package.json and determine whether to pre-bundle it or not.

However, it currently breaks in the vite-builder test because of an import() of the new react-dom/client, which only exists in react 18.  Due to link, we have to do a little bit of trickery to stop vite from erroring out.  The approach I'm taking here is: 1) Rewriting the import of react-dom/client to a dummy file if it can't be require.resolve()ed.  This fixes the problem in production builds. 2) Additionally, adding react-dom/client to the list of optimizeDeps.exclude if the framework is react and the package can't be required.  This is necessary to prevent vite from trying to pre-bundle, and throwing errors in dev. This PR also updates the examples to the new 6.5.0-alpha.58 version of storybook, which includes the PR mentioned above, so that it can be tested in our react examples, and it adds a new react-18 example as well.",0

Instead of using a babel transform, this creates a vite plugin, similar to the vue-docgen plugin, but based on the babel-plugin-react-docgen.  This gives us the chance to rely directly on react-docgen, without needing another package in between, and it avoids being accidentally overwritten if users replace our @vitejs/plugin-react with their own config. This new vite plugin is not configurable like the babel plugin is, but I'm not certain those configurations are necessary in the first place.  If we hear from users that it's something they need, we can find a way to make them customizable, but I prefer to avoid extra options if possible. This version does not create a global list of all the docs, like the babel plugin does (DOC_GEN_COLLECTION_NAME).  I looked through the storybook source, and it doesn't seem like anything still relies on it, so I think it's just a legacy detail for now that we can probably avoid supporting.
