Fully support Vite 4, remove @vitejs/plugin-react, update @storybook/mdx1-csf by @IanVS in https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/pull/548

Breaking Changes
To fully support Vite 4, we've updated our mdx handling to no longer require the use of @vitejs/plugin-react.  This means that non-react projects will no longer be getting that plugin added to their projects, and react projects will need to make sure they include it as a dependency (changes to viteFinal are not required).

fix: Load @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte conditionally by @IanVS in https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/pull/434

This version requires Vite 3.  If you are using Vite 2, you'll need to stay on the 0.1.X branch until you're able to upgrade. Vite migration notes can be found at https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/docs/guide/migration.md.
In addition, for svelte projects, svelte.config.js will be used automatically in your storybook config.  This means that if you were merging your options into svelteOptions in .storybook/main.cjs previously, you can remove it.  If you need storybook config to be different from your app, you can still use the svelteOptions as an override.
