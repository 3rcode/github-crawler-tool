This change works around that limitation by first injecting custom window.Notification in the main process using webContents.executeJavaScript and then by passing messages between browser context (Messenger code) and the Isolated Context (Caprine’s browser.js) via window.postMessage/window.addEventListener('message', …). As a bonus, this PR adds support for onclick and onclose Notification events used by Messenger. That allows us to remove selectConversationByImg, since Messenger selects the conversation in the onclick callback! 😃  Fixes #700",Fix notifications (#717),"Electron’s context isolation is preventing any window.Notification modification done by the preload script (browser.js).
