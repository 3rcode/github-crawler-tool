The fix for reading the value from npm_config_disturl by parsing gyp.opts.disturl was landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/2547 and that change was released in node-gyp v9.0.0, so this change updates the error macro to recommend node-gyp v9.0.0 as the minimum required version.

If so, we reported a bad message. Otherwise, we passed it up to the base class' UpdatePrintSettings(). CL4313019 removed the cookie param, so checking for a bad cookie param is no longer necessary / no longer possible. Since the only remaining task was to pass the work up to the base class, this commit removes the subclass implmentation entirely.   chore: update patches   chore: bump chromium in DEPS to 113.0.5647.0   chore: bump chromium in DEPS to 113.0.5649.2   chore: bump chromium in DEPS to 113.0.5651.0   chore: update patches    Co-authored-by: electron-roller[bot] 84116207+electron-roller[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Co-authored-by: Charles Kerr charles@charleskerr.com Co-authored-by: deepak1556 hop2deep@gmail.com"

Specifically this changes the account name for app ""My App"" from ""My App"" to ""My App AppStore"" if the app is using a MAS build of Electron. We attempt to migrate the safe storage key from the old account, if that migration succeeds we delete the old key and move on. Existing apps that aren't built for the app store should be unimpacted, there is one edge case where a user uses BOTH an AppStore and a darwin build of the same app only one will keep it's access to the safestorage key as during the migration we delete the old account.  This is an acceptable edge case as no one should be actively using two versions of the same app."

483,fix: WebAuthn Discoverable Credential (Resident Credential) (#35374)," fix: WebAuthn Discoverable Credential (Resident Credential) #33353  Enables support for Webauthn discoverable credentials (aka resident credentials). This allows users to authenticate without first having to select or type a username. To decide if discoverable credentials are supported, the class 'AuthenticatorCommon', in the chrome content code, indirectly calls the method 'context::WebAuthenticationDelegate.SupportsResidentKeys(..)'. The default implementation of this returns false, leaving it up to specific implementations to override. This change adds a new class 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate' to subclass 'WebAuthenticationDelegate' and override the behaviour of the 'SupportsResidentKeys' method to return true. The implementation is copied from the Chrome browser equivalent 'ChromeWebAuthenticationDelegate', though the chrome class includes other methods that don't seem to be required for this functionality. The 'ElectronContentClient' class was also updated to store an instance of 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate', and to provide an accessor method, GetWebAuthenticationDelegate().

637,fix: Wayland general CSD fixes (#34955)," fix: broken wayland window decorations due to botched chromium update  The GetTitlebarBounds().height() is obviously intended to be placed in the top parameter, which used to be the second one before upstream removed multi-parameter gfx::Rect::Inset, but it's the first parameter for gfx::Insets::TLBR, which was intended to replace the removed Inset function. However, whoever updated Chromium kept the parameter unchanged, causing the title bar height to be passed to the left parameter, causing the window title bar to be unclickable.  fix: wayland window top bar buttons unclickable  Use NonClientFrameView::TargetForRect for the ClientFrameViewLinux implementation because the default inherited from FramelessView blocks any non-HTCLIENT events.   fix: add maximized parameter to LinuxUI::GetWindowFrameProvider   fix: pass frame_->IsMaximized() to GetWindowFrameProvider   This ensures that the toolkit renders the window decorations in maximized mode while the window is maximized to ensure that there is no empty space around the window."

647,fix: ensure native modules use the correct config (#35159)," fix: ensure native modules are built with config.gypi  This works by patching node.h to check that two defines are set using the equivilant of an XNOR operation.  One define ""ELECTRON_ENSURE_CONFIG_GYPI"" is set via common.gypi which is already used to build native modules and has been since the dawn of time.  Therefore this define will be set for all native module compilations targetting the Electron runtime.  The second define ""USING_ELECTRON_CONFIG_GYPI"" is only defined when the gypi argument ""using_electron_config_gypi"" is set to 1 which is only done so via config.gypi.  Only new enough versions of node-gyp correctly use the config.gypi file thus resulting in a compilation error on version of node-gyp that are too old.  chore: fix lint  Co-authored-by: Samuel Attard sattard@salesforce.com"

For our nan tests which do link against Chromiums libc++ we define the ABI namespace in the spec runner.

800,fix: performance problem in crashReporter.start() on macOS (#34609),"fix: performance problem in crashReporter.start() on macOS This change reduces the duration of crashReporter.start() on Intel macOS from 622 milliseconds to 257 milliseconds! Backports https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/crashpad/crashpad/+/3641386 posix: Replace DoubleForkAndExec() with ForkAndSpawn() The DoubleForkAndExec() function was taking over 622 milliseconds to run   on macOS 11 (BigSur) on Intel i5-1038NG7. I did some debugging by adding   some custom traces and found that the fork() syscall is the bottleneck   here, i.e., the first fork() takes around 359 milliseconds and the   nested fork() takes around 263 milliseconds. Replacing the nested fork()   and exec() with posix_spawn() reduces the time consumption to 257   milliseconds! See https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/3064 to know why fork() is so   slow on macOS and why posix_spawn() is a better replacement. Another point to note is that even base::LaunchProcess() from Chromium   calls posix_spawnp() on macOS -   https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/8f8d82dea0fa8f11f57c74dbb65126f8daba58f7:base/process/launch_mac.cc;l=295-296 Change-Id: I25c6ee9629a1ae5d0c32b361b56a1ce0b4b0fd26   Reviewed-on: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/crashpad/crashpad/+/3641386   Reviewed-by: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org   Commit-Queue: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org Fixes: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/34321 Signed-off-by: Darshan Sen raisinten@gmail.com"

936,fix: fix a crash in safeStorage on Linux (#33913),"On Linux, isEncryptionAvailable() was crashing instead of returning a boolean before the 'ready' event was emitted by the app. The reason of the crash is that CreateKeyStorage() expects the config to be set but the function responsible for setting the config, SetConfig(), is called only after the app is ready inside PostCreateMainMessageLoop(). So this changes IsEncryptionAvailable() to return false when the app is not ready on Linux and uses that instead of the raw API in other places like EncryptString() and DecryptString().

Making sure we run the C++ linter before deleting git directories fixes the issue. In any case, this commit always manually passes --project_root to cpplint.py so that the implicit default is explicitly declared and saves some confusion for the next person hitting this.

1828,feat: Allow detection of MITM HTTPS proxies like ZScaler (#30174)," feat: Allow detection of MITM HTTPS proxies like ZScaler  For security purposes, Figma heavily restrics the origins that are allowed to load within our Electron app. Unfortunately some corporate environments use MITM proxies like ZScaler, which intercepts our connection to https://www.figma.com and serves a redirect to e.g. https://gateway.zscloud.net before finally redirecting back to https://www.figma.com. In order to detect this situation and handle it gracefully, we need to be able to know whether or not the certificate for our own origin (https://www.figma.com) is chained to a known root. We do this by exposesing CertVerifyResult::is_issued_by_known_root. If the certification verification passed without the certificate being tied to a known root, we can safely assume that we are dealing with a MITM proxy that has its root CA installed locally on the machine. This means that HTTPS can't be trusted so we might as well make life easier for corporate users by loosening our origin restrictions without any manual steps.  Tweak docs wording"

Just continue to monitor it and await proper response from server. Also add circut breaker to cancel request if proxy auth failed 3 times (for example user keeps cancelling auth). This behavior happens only when app registered WebRequest api listeners.  Port chromium webrequest changes to electron code.  Move relevant parts of chromium WebRequestProxyingURLLoaderFactory from https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2011781 into electron ProxyingURLLoaderFactory.  Update code to upstreamed version and remove retyr count failsafe.  Co-authored-by: Milan Burda milan.burda@gmail.com"
1970,fix: microtasks policy in CreateEnvironment (#29531)," fix: microtasks policy in CreateEnvironment  Microtasks policy should not be updated for the renderer because NodeBindings::CreateEnvironment might be entered with or without UvRunOnce() on stack. One of the examples of such calls is window.open() which is possible to invoke while uv_run() is still running (e.g. with setImmediate()). All in all, it doesn't matter that much which policy we use since v8::MicrotasksScope has a check for the policy in its destructor and no commits will be made if the policy is kExplicit. It is important, however, to not change the policy in the middle of UvRunOnce() so we should respect whatever we currently have and move on.

1997,fix: ensure the typescript definitions only export correct value types (#28712)," fix: ensure the typescript definitions only export correct value types  In typescript there are two main types of ""types"" you can export, value types (class, const) and definition types (type, interface).  The typescript compiler will let anything declared via const or class be used as a value.  Unfortunately we were exporting a bunch of things (see the diff) as class/const when they weren't actually exported values. This lead to typescript being happy but the runtime throwing errors (not something we want). This change passes ""exported-in"" context through our docs, to the parser and then to the definitions generator to ensure we only mark things as exported in the ts defs that we actually export.

2323,refactor: clean up webFrame implementation to use gin wrappers (#28497)," refactor: clean up webFrame implementation to use gin wrappers  The previous implementation of webFrame in the renderer process leaked sub-frame contexts and global objects across the context boundaries thus making it possible for apps to either maliciously or accidentally violate the contextIsolation boundary. This re-implementation binds all methods in native code directly to content::RenderFrame instances instead of relying on JS to provide a ""window"" with every method request.  This is much more consistent with the rest of the Electron codebase and is substantially safer.   chore: un-re-order for ease of review   chore: pass isolate around instead of ErrorThrower   chore: fix rebase typo   chore: remove unused variables "

3083,feat: support exclude from capture on Windows (#24274)," feat: support exclude from capture on Windows  Check for WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE support, and fallback to WDA_MONITOR. Windows versions that support exclude from capture will exclude the window entirely when setContentProtection is enabled similar to how Mac behaves. Fall back to WDA_MONITOR for windows verisions that do not support. This flag is mentioned at the very end of a Microsoft blog post here: https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2019/09/16/new-ways-to-do-screen-capture/ Use WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE for content protection on windows Starting with Windows 10, version 2004 this will exclude a window similar to the expected behavior on mac. It is safe to use WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE on older Windows versions, as it will still behave as if WDA_MONITOR is applied. https://github.com/microsoft/Windows.UI.Composition-Win32-Samples/issues/64#issuecomment-697074762 See the docs here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowdisplayaffinity  docs: update setContentProtection docs  Update setContentProtection docs with WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE info. This is to support screen capture fully excluding a particular window instead of showing it as a black screen."

For instance, when user sets 'en-US, ja-JP' to Accept-Language, while Chromium chooses Japanese font for kanji text, but Electron chooses Chinese font.  This is because only the first language was given to Accept-Language on Electron.

Since Windows refers to the Z order from low to high it means that the window provided as reference will always precede the electron window, which is the opposite of what we want in this function, since the electron window is displayed behind the referenced window. The change is simply to ask SetWindowPos to position our window behind the window that's above the reference window, effectively making our window sit just above the reference one.  lint"

4368,fix: restore accessibility window title on macOS (#21462),"Electron's AtomNSWindow implements accessibilityAttributeValue to provide various accessibility info to the OS, including window titles. Chromium 75 changed to Apple's newer accessibility API for window titles in the super class that AtomNSWindow inherits from. macOS still supports both the old and new style APIs, but it will prefer the new style if it is implemented.  This means the Electron window title is being ignored because the newer API at the Chromium level has taken precedence. By implementing the newer accessibility API in AtomNSWindow, this restores correct accessibility window titles in macOS Electron apps. This is a regression has been present since Electron 6.0.0 (the first release including the Chromium change above)."

When we create a completely new BrowserView instance, it starts of as visible (even when it hasn't been added to the window), which means that it will need its own compositor instead of using the recycled compositor. To fix this, lets make BrowserViews hidden by default until they're added to the window. See also #19988. This is a potentially breaking change given that the initial value of document.visibilityState will now be hidden, but given the experimental status of BrowserViews, I think this is a fine change to make. The old behavior can be restored with webPreferences: { show: true }. Notes: Fix compositor recycling when creating new BrowserView"

4429,fix: prevent silent failure when DOM storage quota exceeded (#20899),"  test: update DOM storage quota limits test   fix: update dom_storage_limits.patch (fixes #13465)   The previous version of this patch did not include changes required to circumvent the quota enforcement performed by StorageAreaImpl. Consequently when the quota was exceeded, things still ""appeared to work"" at first but then would later fail silently. That is, the cache would be updated but the backing store would not. This could be fixed by disabling the code below (from content/browser/dom_storage/storage_area_impl.cc) // Only check quota if the size is increasing, this allows   // shrinking changes to pre-existing maps that are over budget.   if (new_item_size > old_item_size && new_storage_used > max_size_) {     if (map_state_ == MapState::LOADED_KEYS_ONLY) {       receivers_.ReportBadMessage(           ""The quota in browser cannot exceed when there is only one ""           ""renderer."");     } else {       std::move(callback).Run(false);     }     return;   } However, since this seems to have some unintended side-effects (see updated notes in dom_storage_limits.patch) it seems more prudent to simply increase the quota to a larger yet still reasonable size rather than attempt to circumvent the storage quota altogether."

Someone helped me out with a CSP meta tag which I have later noticed is indeed mentioned in the checklist, too: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#csp-meta-tag. I have not used the checklist one verbatim because it prevents a script tag from working when serving index.html through the file: protocol as the quick start does. I instead used the one the person in my issue recommended which seems to work well to me. I am not that well versed in CSP so there might be a better policy to include with the quick start, but this is what I've got for now."

5041,fix: throw on invalid webRequest filters (#19337),"Closes #11371. Previously, we didn't consider the return value of the webRequest URLPattern mate converter, which meant that when the pattern wasn't correctly parsed owing to invalid filter specification users would not be made aware of that fact and would just think that the filtering itself had failed. This corrects that error by moving the business logic of url pattern parsing out of the converter and into the function itself so that granular and specific errors can be thrown. There's also no real reason that i'm aware of not to allow wider breadth of filters by letting users use a wildcard for effective TLD, so I also overrode that (default for the 1-arg Parse is not to allow that). Finally, I added some examples of url filter types for users to reference."

We want to keep default move conflict handling behavior in that it's still what most users would expect, but there exist edge cases in which users may not want to be forced into that behavior. This thus introduces an optional conflict handler that allows developers access to more granular move actions. They could now allow the user to choose whether to delete an existing app in favor of the current one being moved, or whether to quit the current app and focus on the existing one should it both exist and be running. I added a fair amount of new documentation outlining this behavior, but if there are things users may benefit from seeing examples of or nuances that should be added please leave feedback!"

5133,fix: add support for prefers-color-scheme CSS query (#19228),The wiring to update prefs when you toggle between dark mode and light mode exists in the content layer but the actual value setting is done in either //chrome or in shell.

It addressed the crash, but also created a race condition whereby when a new tray is created the old tray's destroy wouldn't have been fully completed and therefore a new one would be spawned.

This means there is now a 1:1 relationship between request and DesktopCapturer so there isn't a race condition between the observer for one request calling back before the observer of another.  This is an issue ever since the backing APIs moved to worker threads. This also does a few things to ensure memory management * Only ever listen to one event per-request, after that we wipe the emit function to ignore all future events * Ensures we clean up the window_capturer_, screen_capturer_ and captured_sources_ in native land once the request is over. This in theory fixes a flake we've been seeing on CI where we try to resolve the promise for a request that no longerr exists."

5625,fix: Comparison using is when operands support eq (#17864)," Comparison using is when operands support eq  Comparison using 'is' when equivalence is not the same as identity When you compare two values using the is or is not operator, it is the object identities of the two values that is tested rather than their equality. If the class of either of the values in the comparison redefines equality then the is operator may return False even though the objects compare as equal. Equality is defined by the eq or, in Python2, cmp method. To compare two objects for equality, use the == or != operator instead. Recommendation When you want to compare the value of two literals, use the comparison operator == or != in place of is or is not. If the uniqueness property or performance are important then use an object that does not redefine equality.  fix: Comparison using is when operands support eq  Comparison using 'is' when equivalence is not the same as identity When you compare two values using the is or is not operator, it is the object identities of the two values that is tested rather than their equality. If the class of either of the values in the comparison redefines equality then the is operator may return False even though the objects compare as equal.

This ensure that the assertion fails for the test that actually caused the issue but cleans up the left-over windows so that future tests do not fail.  fix: maintain a ref count for objects sent over remote  Previously there was a race condition where a GC could occur in the renderer process between the main process sending a meta.id and the renderer pulling the proxy out its weakmap to stop it being GC'ed. This fixes that race condition by maintaining a ""sent"" ref count in the object registry and a ""received"" ref count in the object cache on the renderer side.  The deref request now sends the number of refs the renderer thinks it owns, if the number does not match the value in the object registry it is assumed that there is an IPC message containing a new reference in flight and this race condition was hit. The browser side ref count is then reduced and we wait for the new deref message.  This guaruntees that an object will only be removed from the registry if every reference we sent has been guarunteed to be unreffed."

Reserving a vector to save on reallocation cost.  Narrow scopes of variables to avoid error and optimize them.  Made two vectors scope narrower and reserved them because we know the size in advance.

6193,feat: preloads and nodeIntegration in iframes (#16425)," feat: add support for node / preloads in subframes  This feature has delibrately been built / implemented in such a way that it has minimum impact on existing apps / code-paths. Without enabling the new ""nodeSupportInSubFrames"" option basically none of this new code will be hit. The things that I believe need extra scrutiny are:  Introduction of event.reply for IPC events and usage of event.reply instead of event.sender.send() Usage of node::FreeEnvironment(env) when the new option is enabled in order to avoid memory leaks.  I have tested this quite a bit and haven't managed to cause a crash but it is still feature flagged behind the ""nodeSupportInSubFrames"" flag to avoid potential impact.

6406,fix: restore ability to disable color correct rendering (#15898),"In Electron 2.0, --disable-features=ColorCorrectRendering could be used to make the app use the display color space (e.g. P3 on Macs) instead of color correcting to sRGB. Because color correct rendering is always enabled on Chromium 62 and later and because --force-color-profile has no effect on macOS, apps that need e.g. P3 colors are currently stuck on Electron 2.0. This restores the functionality removed in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/698347 in the form of the --disable-color-correct-rendering switch. This can be removed once web content (including WebGL) learn how to deal with color spaces. That is being tracked at https://crbug.com/634542 and https://crbug.com/711107. As an example of a widely used app using --disable-features=ColorCorrectRendering, see VSCode: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/3f33ef2593d3efe6eca5230f3d34d3406fb73498/src/main.js#L138-L139 Notes: Add --disable-color-correct-rendering switch"

7136,fix: change subprocess.Popen calls to work on Linux too (#14689)," fix: remove 'shell=True' when calling 'git diff'  Calling subprocess.Popen() with a list of args and shell=True causes the args to be ignored, so ['git', 'diff', '--name-only', '--staged'] was turning into just 'git'. Instead of getting a list of changed files, we got the --help message. Two possible fixes: change it from a list to a single string, or remove 'shell=True'. The shell doesn't seem to be needed, so I chose that.

7681,chore: [gn] fix CSP warning in debugger API test (#13541),"There's an attempt to suppress the warning in spec/static/main.js, which sets process.env.ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS. However, it sets the variable too late in the boot process: by the time that line in main.js has run, a child zygote has already been booted. test.py works around this by setting that environment variable outside of the test process, to ensure that it gets propagated to all children. I've been running the GN tests directly with ./out/Default/electron electron/spec, rather than through the wrapper script, and the api-debugger-spec.js tests were failing, because they depend on a particular log message being the first one emitted, and the CSP warning was causing that test to fail, since it wasn't being correctly suppressed. Instead of writing another wrapper script, this just fixes the underlying thing that the warning is complaining about, which I think is reasonable because the test's pass/fail depends on this specific behaviour."

8041,perf: don't use JSON to send the result of ipcRenderer.sendSync. (#8953),"  Don't use JSON to send the result of ipcRenderer.sendSync.   Change the return type of AtomViewHostMsg_Message_Sync from base::string16   to base::ListValue  Adjust lib/browser/api/web-contents.js and /lib/renderer/api/ipc-renderer.js   to wrap/unwrap return values to/from array, instead of   serializing/deserializing JSON.  This change can greatly improve ipcRenderer.sendSync calls where the return value contains Buffer instances, because those are converted to Array before being serialized to JSON(which has no efficient way of representing byte arrays). A simple benchmark where remote.require('fs') was used to read a 16mb file got at least 5x faster, not to mention it used a lot less memory.  This difference tends increases with larger buffers.   Don't base64 encode Buffers   Don't allocate V8ValueConverter on the heap   Replace hidden global.sandbox with NodeBindings::IsInitialized()   Refactoring: check NodeBindings::IsInitialized() in V8ValueConverter   Refactor problematic test to make it more reliable   Add tests for NaN and Infinity "

Check for graceful exits on Linux, too.  Rewrite the ""exits gracefully on macos"" spec to run on Linux too.   Check for graceful exits everywhere.   Tweak comment   Better error logging in api-app-spec.js. (#12122)   In the 'exits gracefully' test for app.exit(exitCode), print the relevant error information if the test fails.  Run the exit-gracefully test on macOS and Linux.  Windows does not support sending signals, but Node.js offers some emulation with process.kill(), and subprocess.kill(). Sending signal 0 can be used to test for the existence of a process. Sending SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL cause the unconditional termination of the target process. So, we'll need a different approach if we want to test this in win32."

10594,Special attribute for macOS accessibility #7206,"In the linked issue we were discussing that Electron apps are inaccessible unless VoiceOver is enabled. While it's a working solution for users with vision impairment, all other users and apps that require accessibility can't interact with Electron-based software because they don't keep VoiceOver running. I suggest adding AXManualAccessibility for programmatically enabling it in Electron apps. The reason for a new attribute is that AXEnhancedUserInterface is already reserved by VoiceOver. Adding this attribute will allow both Electron developers and 3rd party developers to enable and disable accessibility from their code by calling accessibilitySetValue:forAttribute: on the application. It will be also possible to create a small utility app to switch accessibility in Electron-based apps until there's a native UI solution (like the accessibility settings page in Chrome)."

11178,Let Chromium manage document.visibilityState and document.hidden,"Chromium already includes the necessary plumbing to manage the visibility properties and visibilitychange event so this gets rid of most of our custom logic for BrowserWindow and BrowserView. Note that webview remains unchanged and is still affected by the issues listed below. User facing changes:   The document visibility properties and visibilitychange event are   now also updated/fired in response to occlusion changes on macOS. In   other words, document.visibilityState will now be hidden on macOS   if the window is occluded by another window.   Previously, visibilitychange was also fired by both Electron and   Chromium in some cases (e.g. when hiding the window). Now it is only   fired by Chromium so you no longer get duplicate events.   The visiblity state of BrowserWindows created with { show: false }   is now initially visible until the window is shown and hidden.   The visibility state of BrowserWindows with backgroundThrottling   disabled is now permanently visible.   This should also fix #6860 (but not for webview)."

11678,Change translation of license to 授權條款,"The translation of license should not be 憑證. 憑證 means certificate but not license in Chinese. For example, Symantec translated digital certificate as 數位憑證; Chrome Support used the teams 憑證授權單位 and SSL 憑證 to describe CA and SSL Certificate. These are all proving that the word 憑證 is commonly used in the translation of certificate, but not license I googled for a while, and found that the team 授權條款 is commonly used to describe license in Traditional Chinese. The user of the translation 授權條款 includes governments (Taiwan Government, Hong Kong government), communities (Open Source Hong Kong and OpenFoundry), and businesses (Google). So I suggest we should use 授權條款, which has been widely adopted  as translation of license, instead of a wrong translation 憑證."

Unfortunately <webview> suffers from a number of problems. To make matters worse, many of these are upstream Chromium bugs instead of Electron-specific bugs. For us at Figma, the main issue is very slow performance. Despite the upstream improvements to <webview> through the OOPIF work, it is probable that there will continue to be <webview>-specific bugs in the future. Therefore, this introduces a <webview> alternative to called BrowserView, which...   is a thin wrapper around api::WebContents (so bugs in BrowserView will   likely also be bugs in BrowserWindow web contents)   is instantiated in the main process like BrowserWindow (and unlike   <webview>, which lives in the DOM of a BrowserWindow web contents)   needs to be added to a BrowserWindow to display something on the screen   This implements the most basic API. The API is expected to evolve and change in the near future and has consequently been marked as experimental. Please do not use this API in production unless you are prepared to deal with breaking changes. In the future, we will want to change the API to support multiple BrowserViews per window. We will also want to consider z-ordering auto-resizing, and possibly even nested views."

Set process.platform and process.execPath in sandboxed renderer   environment. This is required to spawn the windows crash service from   sandboxed renderer.

Consider the following ""foo.h"": cpp namespace { class Foo; } class Bar {   public:     Foo* getFoo();     Foo* foo; } If the 'foo.h' is included in multiple .cc files, the compiler will put Foo into a different anonymous namespace in each .cc, which means there are different definitions of Foo in the program (a violation of the ODR)."

13919,Allow webview guests to be resized manually,This adds the disableguestresize property for webviews to prevent the webview guest from reacting to size changes of the webview element. This also partially documents the webContents.setSize function in order to manually control the webview guest size. These two features can be combined to improve resize performance for e.g. webviews that span the entire window. This greatly reduces the lag described in #6905.

14660,Update to Electron v1.3.7,
14661,"Add some tests for ""sandbox"" option",
14662,Use the routing id on api::WebContents::GetID,"The sandbox option allows multiple webContents in one renderer process, so using the only the renderer id to identify WebContents instances is no longer an option. WebContents::GetID now returns a 64-bit integer, which is composed of both the process id(high 32), and the RenderViewHost routing id(low 32). Also add a GetProcessID that retrieves the renderer process id, a requirement in some of our javascript code."
14663,Improve AtomSandboxedRendererClient to support preload scripts.,Add RenderFrameObserver/RenderViewObserver subclasses that implement the necessary support for preload scripts in sandboxed renderers.
14664,Embed setup bundle for preload scripts in sandboxed renderers.,"Add a gyp target that creates a browserify bundle starting with lib/sandboxed_renderer/init.js, which is embedded into the executable using the atom_js2c target. The goal of this bundle is to provide a very basic environment for preload scripts where a require function is available."
14665,Add browser side support for reading files from renderer.,
14666,Move code that defines ipcRenderer methods into another file.,
14667,Refactor the atom_js2c target to include javascript from multiple dirs.,"Before invoking js2c, copy all files that must be embedded into the shared intermediate directory, and modify the js2c wrapper script to include all files from that directory(which is passed as argument). This allows the build system to embed files that don't share a common base directory, such as javascript generated at build time."
14668,Move EmitIPCEvent into AtomRenderViewObserver.,Refactor this function as a method so it is possible to inherit most behavior from AtomRenderViewObserver and override EmitIPCEvent.
14669,Expose atom_api_renderer_ipc module API,
14670,Add atom::AtomSandboxedRendererClient class,
14671,Add support for native chromium popups on sandboxed renderers.," Allow api::Window instances to be created from existing api::WebContents. Override WebContentsCreated and AddNewContents to wrap renderer-created   content::WebContents into api::WebContents. For content::WebContents that should be displayed in new windows, pass the   wrapped api::WebContents object to window manager."
14672,Allow api::WebContents to fully wrap an existing content::WebContents.," Add an overload to WebContents::CreateFrom that accepts a type parameter. If   type is REMOTE, initialization is the same as before(a thin wrapper). If   not, the api::WebContents will be fully initialized, as if it was created by   api::WebContents::Create. Move common initialization code to InitWithSessionAndOptions."
14673,Decouple api::Window initialization from api::WebContents construction.,
14674,Expose --enable-sandbox command-line switch.,"When --enable-sandbox is passed, electron will use chromium sandbox to spawn all renderers, and every new BrowserWindow will automatically have ""sandboxed"" passed as a web preference(since the renderer would not work properly otherwise)."
14675,"Add ""sandboxed"" option to ""webPreferences"".","When ""sandboxed"" is passed as a web preference for BrowserWindow, the newly created renderer won't run any node.js code/integration, only communicating with the system via the IPC API of the content module. This is a requirement for running the renderer under chrome OS-level sandbox. Beyond that, certain behaviors of AtomBrowserClient are modified when dealing with sandboxed renderers:  OverrideSiteInstanceNavigation no longer create a new SiteInstance for   every navigation. Instead, it reuses the source SiteInstance when not   navigating to a different site. CanCreateWindow will return true and allow javascript access."

17107,Override child_process.execFile asar patch for child_process.exec,"NodeJS implements child_process.exec by simply passing the whole command to child_process.execFile. See:  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L90 https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L99  Electron patches child_process.execFile to add support for asar archives by injecting logic that extracts the required files from the asar to a temporary location before delegating the work to the original child_process.execFile. In order to decide whether to inject the custom asar extracting logic, Electron makes use of a helper function called splitPath(). See:  https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/common/asar.js#L37  If the first argument of the returned array equals true, means that the path is considered to be an asar archive, and thus the extraction logic takes place. The problem is that if the command passed to child_process.execFile contains a path to an asar archive, padded with other commands/arguments, splitPath() will consider it to be an asar archive, and will try to extract it, throwing a rightfully Invalid package error.

I put the API on the dialog module, even though Mac OS X requires that the native window hold and return the desired offset.   I was originally hoping to make this an argument on the actual dialog.show* calls, but it seems the parameter set is defined in libchromiumcontent and I wasn't sure it would be appropriate to add there?   The API could also be on the BrowserWindow (eg BrowserWindow.setSheetOffset). I don't have a strong preference, but I think it's more discoverable on the dialog module. "

NSImageView normally uses the correct color for template images magicaly, but I think the addition of event handlers in the container view prevents the image view from determining highlight state. This PR switches to drawing the image manually. The drawRect function decides whether to use image or alternateImage(pressed image) and then if that image is marked as a template, it fills it with the same color used for the text before drawing it."

Chrome exposes scroll and wheel events, but these aren't sufficient to implement the interaction because the element needs to ""snap"" when the user lifts their fingers from the trackpad, not when they / we stop receiving wheel / scroll events. These events may stop before the user lifts their fingers, or continue after the user has lifted their fingers if they had enough momentum for the gesture to continue. This exposes BrowserWindow scroll-touch-down and scroll-touch-up, which fire immeditaely when the user touches two fingers to the trackpad, and again when the user lifts their fingers. Combined with the existing wheel event should allow for ""swipe-to-archive"" and other similar interactions. Note: This is only implemented on Mac OS X and the events don't fire unless you're using a trackpad! Related: #1486, #2683, https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/541"

19402,Fixes #2810: correct look of hidden-inset windows in full screen.,"hidden and hidden-inset windows differ only by the hidden-inset window having a toolbar. Yet, the toolbar yields an incorrect look in fullscreen mode. So, we hide and recreate the toolbar for such windows when going to/from fullscreen. There are some visible artifacts during the fullscreen animations, as the toolbar gets created and destroyed. When entering fullscreen, you see a toolbar that then disappears. When going back to normal window, you see the traffic light buttons jump around a little bit. Yet, this is definitely better than the current broken fullscreen look."

An application like this will fail when being packaged in an asar with an following error: Error: spawn EACCES Electron overrides certain fs functions to make them work within an asar package. In the case of execFile, the file to be executed is extracted from the asar package into a temporary file and ran from there. The problem is that during the extraction, the original permissions of the file are lost. We workaround this by:   Extending asar.stat to return whether a file is executable or not,   which is information that's already saved in the asar header.   Setting execution permissions on the extracted file if the above   property holds true.   Fixes: https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/3512"

I've added an example of the behaviour of return values from synchronously called callbacks from renderer, and have changed the advice from 'you shouldn't do this' to 'be careful when you do this'."

24849,fix node to build with target_arch=x64 on linux,"atom-shell on linux is incorrectly reporting ia32 for process.arch. This is happening because -Dtarget_arch=ia32 is passed to ninja on linux inside script/update.py which leads to '-DARCH=""ia32""' being set in the compile flags. I see that the current intention is to target 64 bit builds on linux (37275c64cd07) and the binaries are in fact compiled as 64 bit despite this bug.  I guess ninja is somehow smartly ignoring the incorrect setting of the -m32 flags at https://github.com/atom/node/blob/6d772c3cda0bb8270857397e128ea1e36c361125/common.gypi#L175-L178. Until this is fixed it breaks usage of any node-pre-gyp packaged node addons because node-pre-gyp depends on process.arch being correct in order to require the right binary arch."

25543,Bump v0.11.10.,
25544,Do not use new clang flags.,
25545,mac: Always cancel application termination.,"OS X's application termination doesn't work very well with C++ message loops. Especially when we return NSTerminateLater for shouldTerminate, it would be impossible for the C++ message loop to quit, because unless we explictly let NSApp terminate the application, the message loop would think the application is not terminated and will run forever. The fix is to simply ignore the Cocoa's application termination request and let the C++ message loop deal with it compeletey. But we had the side effect that atom-shell would always cancel OS X's shutdown request, this is also the approach chosen by Chromium. Fixes #229. Fixes atom/atom#1864."

27205,Set our WebKit preferences.,
27206,Handle keyboard events with AtomEventProcessingWindow.,Some system events like cmd+` will be handled by it automatically.
27207,Fix devtools.,
27208,AtomBrowserMainParts is platform-independent now.,
27209,use AtomEventProcessingWindow as native window.,
27210,Steal ChromeEventProcessingWindow from chrome.,"Chromium has done quite a lot of low level works for us, steal them to ease our lives."
27211,Implement generic native window class.,
27212,Initial empty browser.,
27213,Add submodules.,
27214,Send focus/blur events when an InspectableWebContents's window gains/loses focus,We listen for key window chages and inform content::RenderWidgetHostView as appropriate.
27215,Remember where the dev tools were docked between launches,
27216,Add preferences support for embedding applications,Applications can use brightray::BrowserContext::prefs to get access to preferences that are persisted between launches. brightray::BrowserContext::RegisterPrefs must be used to register preferences before they're accessed. Updated libchromiumcontent to pull in preferences support.  vendor/libchromiumcontent 3944c1c...b6a0d85 (2): Actually compile the base/prefs code Export symbols from base/prefs  
27217,Strip whitespace from the application name in the user agent,Having whitespace in the application name makes the user agent hard to parse.
27218,Include the application's version number in the user agent string,
27219,Allow embedders to provide their own BrowserContext implementation,
27220,Implement Notification.close(),
27221,Make NotificationID more useful,
27222,Fire a click event when a notification is clicked,
27223,Don't fire the show event until the notification is actually shown,
27224,Add CreateUserNotification helper function,
27225,Show notifications even when the app is focused,"It's a little icky to be taking over global state (NSUserNotificationCenter's delegate) like this, but until we have evidence that it gets in someone's way it's the pragmatic thing to do."
27226,Turn NotificationPresenter into an abstract base class,This will allow us to have Mac-specific member variables without a bunch of ifdefs.
27227,Move notification-related code into a new NotificationPresenter class,
27228,Fire a show event when a notification is shown,
27229,Add bare-bones HTML notifications support,"Calling Notification.show() now works. But Notification.close() does nothing, and none of the notification's events fire."
27230,Bump the base SDK and deployment target to 10.8,This required working around an incompatibility in base/mac/foundation_util.h.
27231,Allow embedders to customize the deployment target and base SDK,
27232,Allow overriding MainDelegate::BasicStartupComplete,
27233,Support undocking the devtools view into its own window,
27234,Support docking the devtools on the right side of the window,
27235,Make the devtools close button work,
27236,Merge InspectableWebContentsImpl and DevToolsFrontend,"While this prevents clients from easily implementing their own devtools windows, it gives us much easier control over the devtools experience."
27237,Fix double-delete of BrowserMainParts,The caller of BrowserClient::CreateBrowserMainParts handles destroying the BrowserMainParts instance we return.
27238,Fix lifetime management of URLRequestContextGetter,I noticed this bug while adding persistent cookie storage.
27239,Persist cookies to disk,"We use Chrome's SQLitePersistentCookieStore to save cookies to a file called ""Cookies"" within the application support directory. Fixes #5."
27240,Update libchromiumcontent, vendor/libchromiumcontent cf87e4d...3944c1c (1): Compile and export SQLitePersistentCookieStore  
27241,Update libchromiumcontent to pull in more headers, vendor/libchromiumcontent 9152595...cf87e4d (1): Export webkit/plugins headers  
27242,Update libchromiumcontent to pull in more headers,
27243,Allow overwriting vendor/download/libchromiumcontent when its version changes,
27244,Update to latest libchromiumcontent,
27245,Stop disabling the sandbox,"Now that we have the resources bundle hooked up correctly, the sandbox functions just fine. Fixes #4."
27246,Make keyboard shortcuts work when the dev tools are focused,We just pass unhandled key events from dev tools along to the main WebContentsDelegate. Part of #2.
27247,Make keyboard shortcuts work on Mac,"When the renderer doesn't handle a key event, we pass it off to the main menu to see if it can handle it. Part of #2."
27248,Fix a NSSplitView leak,
27249,Enforce better header hygiene,"Apple recommends disabling ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS, so we now do. And we also disable USE_HEADER_MAP to match other platforms more closely."
27250,Get the linen background painting during elastic scrolling,We weren't setting the location of the resource bundle correctly in the renderer process. It turns out base::mac::OuterBundle() returns the helper app's bundle in the renderer process. So now we have MainApplicationBundle() to give us the bundle of the main app.
27251,Add InspectableWebContents,This class can be used to create a content::WebContents that can be inspected by the Chrome Dev Tools. This requires embedding applications to copy content_shell.pak into their resource bundle. Right now the dev tools are always docked to the bottom of the view; we don't yet support undocking or changing the docked side. Fixes #1.
27252,Store the disk cache in an app-specific location,We deduce the name of the application from the CFBundleName of the .app bundle and use a path based on that. Similar logic should be implementable for other platforms. Fixes #3.
27253,Use Google-style header guards everywhere,
27254,Initial commit,
