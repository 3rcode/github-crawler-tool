Breaking Changes

Changed the default value of module to module. This will prevent loading of non-context-aware native modules in renderer processes. (See link for more information on this change.) link
Removed deprecated <webview>.getWebContents(). link
Removed the deprecated 'setLayoutZoomLevelLimits' method. link
IPC between main and renderer processes now uses the Structured Clone Algorithm. link
Split shell.openItem(path) into synchronous and asynchronous methods. link

Features

Added module property support for modules. link
Added module API to list custom words in the dictionary. link
Added module API to remove custom words in the dictionary. link
Added module API to access basic service worker info and receive console logs from service workers. link
Added a new module parameter to module on macOS to allow apps to forcefully take focus. link
Added chrome.i18n extension API. link
Added chrome.tabs.connect extension API for background pages. link
Added support for property access to some getter/setter pairs on module. link
Added support for the chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage API when building with enable_electron_extensions. link
Allow an optional callback parameter for WebFrame.executeJavaScript* methods, which is called synchronously unless the target context is paused. link
Restored support for pdfium-based PDF viewer. link

Fixes

Don't allow window to go behind menu bar on mac. link
Fixed module module not working with module protocol. link
Fixed module not working for CORS requests. link
Fixed module not hiding menu bar. link
Fixed an issue where changing theme on macOS would break window maximizability state. link
Fixed crash in network service process when using protocol.registerSchemeAsPrivileged api. link
Fixed crash that could occur when calling module inside the ready event. link
Fixed incorrect hit testing on top of ::after element with layoutNG. link
Fixed missing debug symbols for crashpad handler on macOS. link
Fixed possible freeze on window with disabled background throttling. link
Fixed the print button functionality in the PDF viewer extension. link
Limited manipulation of custom spellchecker dictionary words to persistent sessions. link
Removed extraneous crashpad_handler binary from the Linux distribution files. link
module is now explicitly initialized only in the main process, and implicitly initialized in other child processes. This fixes an issue preventing the crash reporter from functioning in sandboxed renderers on Linux. link
Fixed broken Views API builds. link

Performance

Improved window events handler efficiency on Linux. link
Made setting window icons slightly faster on Linux. link

This release is published to npm under the beta tag and can be installed via npm install electron@beta, or npm i electron@3.1.0-beta.1.
Notable Changes
It's worth highlighting why this release is module instead of module despite the only changes being bugfixes. Fixing #15813 involved changing Electron to use Chromium's Mojo proxy resolver, which was a large enough change to warrant a new beta cycle instead of releasing straight to stable. However this is the only large change relative to 3.0.x, so it's likely that the 3.1.0 beta cycle will be brief.
Fixes

Switch to mojo proxy resolver. #15813
Fixed issue where module would return an empty buffer on macOS. #15803
Fixed unnecessary submenu required for services menuitem. #15672
