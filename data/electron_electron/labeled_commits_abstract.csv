Specifically this changes the account name for app ""My App"" from ""My App"" to ""My App AppStore"" if the app is using a MAS build of Electron. We attempt to migrate the safe storage key from the old account, if that migration succeeds we delete the old key and move on. Existing apps that aren't built for the app store should be unimpacted, there is one edge case where a user uses BOTH an AppStore and a darwin build of the same app only one will keep it's access to the safestorage key as during the migration we delete the old account.  This is an acceptable edge case as no one should be actively using two versions of the same app.",0

fix: WebAuthn Discoverable Credential (Resident Credential) (#35374),0.634508,fix: UAF with http auth preferences (3-1-x). #16140 ,"fix: WebAuthn Discoverable Credential (Resident Credential) #33353 Enables support for Webauthn discoverable credentials (aka resident credentials). This allows users to authenticate without first having to select or type a username. To decide if discoverable credentials are supported, the class 'AuthenticatorCommon', in the chrome content code, indirectly calls the method 'context::WebAuthenticationDelegate.SupportsResidentKeys(..)'. The default implementation of this returns false, leaving it up to specific implementations to override. This change adds a new class 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate' to subclass 'WebAuthenticationDelegate' and override the behaviour of the 'SupportsResidentKeys' method to return true. The implementation is copied from the Chrome browser equivalent 'ChromeWebAuthenticationDelegate', though the chrome class includes other methods that don't seem to be required for this functionality. The 'ElectronContentClient' class was also updated to store an instance of 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate', and to provide an accessor method, GetWebAuthenticationDelegate().

One define ""ELECTRON_ENSURE_CONFIG_GYPI"" is set via common.gypi which is already used to build native modules and has been since the dawn of time.  Therefore this define will be set for all native module compilations targetting the Electron runtime.  The second define ""USING_ELECTRON_CONFIG_GYPI"" is only defined when the gypi argument ""using_electron_config_gypi"" is set to 1 which is only done so via config.gypi.  Only new enough versions of node-gyp correctly use the config.gypi file thus resulting in a compilation error on version of node-gyp that are too old. chore: fix lint Co-authored-by: Samuel Attard sattard@salesforce.com",0

Backports link posix: Replace DoubleForkAndExec() with ForkAndSpawn() The DoubleForkAndExec() function was taking over 622 milliseconds to run   on macOS 11 (BigSur) on Intel i5-1038NG7. I did some debugging by adding   some custom traces and found that the fork() syscall is the bottleneck   here, i.e., the first fork() takes around 359 milliseconds and the   nested fork() takes around 263 milliseconds. Replacing the nested fork()   and exec() with posix_spawn() reduces the time consumption to 257   milliseconds! See link to know why fork() is so   slow on macOS and why posix_spawn() is a better replacement. Another point to note is that even base::LaunchProcess() from Chromium   calls posix_spawnp() on macOS -   link Change-Id: I25c6ee9629a1ae5d0c32b361b56a1ce0b4b0fd26   Reviewed-on: link   Reviewed-by: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org   Commit-Queue: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org Fixes: link Signed-off-by: Darshan Sen raisinten@gmail.com",1

So this changes IsEncryptionAvailable() to return false when the app is not ready on Linux and uses that instead of the raw API in other places like EncryptString() and DecryptString().

Then when the orderBack function is called, it moves the window to the back of its level in the screen list, without changing the key window.

feat: Allow detection of MITM HTTPS proxies like ZScaler (#30174),0.48720974,- Fix a few bugs when intercepting HTTP requests with protocol module.,"feat: Allow detection of MITM HTTPS proxies like ZScaler For security purposes, Figma heavily restrics the origins that are allowed to load within our Electron app. Unfortunately some corporate environments use MITM proxies like ZScaler, which intercepts our connection to link and serves a redirect to e.g. link before finally redirecting back to link. In order to detect this situation and handle it gracefully, we need to be able to know whether or not the certificate for our own origin (link) is chained to a known root. We do this by exposesing CertVerifyResult::is_issued_by_known_root. If the certification verification passed without the certificate being tied to a known root, we can safely assume that we are dealing with a MITM proxy that has its root CA installed locally on the machine. This means that HTTPS can't be trusted so we might as well make life easier for corporate users by loosening our origin restrictions without any manual steps. Tweak docs wording",0

The tests still run fine on linux machine in Electron's pipeline setup on CircleCI, because the docker image used has the non-broken version of python-dbusmock for python2 installed. But running electron tests on any other linux machine would fail if they don't have this non-broken version of python-dbusmock for python2 installed, already, which is the case for most of the machines. Moreover, Python2 is deprecated now. So it would be better if we change the python interpreter in script/spec-runner.js file to python3, for which all the python modules are updated and working.

If connecting via proxy, preflight request can receive 407 header response from proxy. This does not mean request was finished even though it received headers (from proxy, not the destination server), so prevent ""completing"" and most importantly deleting it, which causes request to be canceled in network layer. Just continue to monitor it and await proper response from server. Also add circut breaker to cancel request if proxy auth failed 3 times (for example user keeps cancelling auth). This behavior happens only when app registered WebRequest api listeners. Port chromium webrequest changes to electron code.

fix: microtasks policy in CreateEnvironment (#29531),0.6008072,fix: add microtask runner and fix promise test (backport: 4-0-x). #15171 ,"fix: microtasks policy in CreateEnvironment Microtasks policy should not be updated for the renderer because NodeBindings::CreateEnvironment might be entered with or without UvRunOnce() on stack. One of the examples of such calls is window.open() which is possible to invoke while uv_run() is still running (e.g. with setImmediate()). All in all, it doesn't matter that much which policy we use since v8::MicrotasksScope has a check for the policy in its destructor and no commits will be made if the policy is kExplicit. It is important, however, to not change the policy in the middle of UvRunOnce() so we should respect whatever we currently have and move on.

fix: ensure the typescript definitions only export correct value types (#28712),0.7812541,"Switched to a new TypeScript Definitions generator, which generates more precise definitions. If your TypeScript build fails, this is the likely cause. #18103","fix: ensure the typescript definitions only export correct value types In typescript there are two main types of ""types"" you can export, value types (class, const) and definition types (type, interface).  The typescript compiler will let anything declared via const or class be used as a value.  Unfortunately we were exporting a bunch of things (see the diff) as class/const when they weren't actually exported values. This lead to typescript being happy but the runtime throwing errors (not something we want). This change passes ""exported-in"" context through our docs, to the parser and then to the definitions generator to ensure we only mark things as exported in the ts defs that we actually export.

ShouldFork() is ours and none of the code paths actually use that param, so this commit removes it altogether. chore: update permissions_to_register Refs: link Replace all uses of APIPermission::ID enum with Mojo type refactor: update return type of PreMainMessageLoopRun() Refs: link Used to return void; now returns an int errorcode. Note: 2725153 also has some nice doc updates about Browser's ""stages"" refactor: sync ElectronBrowserMainParts to MainParts changes Refs: link RunMainMessageLoopParts has been replaced with WillRunMainMessageLoop so BrowserMainLoop::result_code_ is no longer available to us for our exit_code_ pointer. This variable held a dual role: (1) of course, hold the exit code, but also (2) was a nullptr before the message loop was ready, indicating to anyone calling SetExitCode() that we were still in startup and could just exit() without any extra steps. exit_code_ still fulfills these two roles but is now a base::Optional. chore: update ElectronBrowserMainParts::PreDefaultMainMessageLoopRun Refs: link BrowserMainParts::BrowsePreDefaultMainMesssageLoopRun() has been removed; move that work to the new WillRunMainMessageLoop(). refactor: stop using CallbackList; it has been removed. Refs: link refactor: update use of threadpools. Refs: link The upstream code is still in flux (e.g. reverts and re-lands) but the tl;dr for this commit is (1) include thread_pool.h if you're using it and (2) don't instantiate pools directly. refactor: remove routing_id from CreateLoaderAndStart Refs: link NB: One logic branch in ProxyingURLLoaderFactory::CreateLoaderAndStart calls std::make_unique, which needs a routing_id. This PR uses the member field routing_id_ since there's no longer one being passed into CreateLoaderAndStart. refactor: sync to upstream ParittionOptions churn Refs: link PartitionOptions' enums have changed. refactor: update Manifest::Location usage Refs: link tldr: s/Manifest::FOO/ManifestLocation::kFoo/ chore: bump chromium in DEPS to 91.0.4465.0 update patches refactor: update extensions::Manifest to upstream Refs: link extensions::Manifest::COMPONENT extensions::mojom::ManifestLocation::kExternalComponent refactor: sync with upstream UrlInfo ctor changes Refs: link UrlInfo ctor now takes UrlInfo::OriginIsolationRequest instead of a bool chore: update invocation of convert_protocol_to_json.py Refs: link python3 is being used in parts of the upstream build, but the copy of convert_protocol_to_json.py invoked in v8/third_party/inspector_protocol is not python3-friendly. Node has a py2+3-friendly version of it in its tools directory, so call it instead. chore: use extensions::mojom::APIPermissionID Refs: link tldr: - extensions::APIPermission::kFoo + extensions::mojom::APIPermissionID::kFoo chore: Remove support for TLS1.0/1.1 in SSLVersionMin policy Refs: link Remove TLS v1.0 & 1.1 from our SSLProtocolVersionFromString() function. This is the same change made upstream at link fixup! chore: update ElectronBrowserMainParts::PreDefaultMainMessageLoopRun chore: Use IDType for permission change subscriptions. Refs: link tldr: {Subscribe,Unsubscribe}PermissionStatusChange's tag type used to be an int; now it's the new SubscriptionId type (which is an IdType64). chore: sync PowerMonitor code to upstream refactor Refs: link tldr: PowerMonitor has been split into PowerStateObserver, PowerSuspendObserver, and PowerThermalObserver to reduce number of tasks posted to consumers who only need notifications for one of those things instead of all of them. chore: use PartitionOptions's new Cookies field Refs: link Revert ""refactor: remove routing_id from CreateLoaderAndStart"" This reverts commit 8c9773b87a3c84f9073a47089eb2b6889d745245. 8c9773b was only a partial fix; reverting to start & try again. update patches chore: bump chromium in DEPS to 91.0.4466.0 chore: update chromium/accelerator.patch Refs: link tldr: sync patch with upstream renamed variable & macro names. chore: update chromium/gtk_visibility.patch Refs: link tldr: no code changes; just updating the diff to apply cleanly. note: ooh upstream Wayland hacking! chore: update chromium/picture-in-picture.patch Refs: link tldr: no code changes; just updating the diff to apply cleanly. chore: update chromium/worker_feat_add_hook_to_notify_script_ready.patch Refs: link tldr: no code changes; just updating the diff to apply cleanly. chore: export_all_patches chore: update chromium/feat_add_set_theme_source_to_allow_apps_to.patch Refs: link tldr: NotifyObservers has been renamed to NotifyOnNativeThemeUpdated, so update the invocation in our patch. chore: update ElectronBrowserClient w/upstream API Refs: link tldr: GetDevToolsManagerDelegate() was returning an owned raw pointer.

A handle to the window to precede the positioned window in the Z order. This parameter must be a window handle or one of the following values. Since Windows refers to the Z order from low to high it means that the window provided as reference will always precede the electron window, which is the opposite of what we want in this function, since the electron window is displayed behind the referenced window.

Chromium 75 changed to Apple's newer accessibility API for window titles in the super class that AtomNSWindow inherits from. macOS still supports both the old and new style APIs, but it will prefer the new style if it is implemented.  This means the Electron window title is being ignored because the newer API at the Chromium level has taken precedence. By implementing the newer accessibility API in AtomNSWindow, this restores correct accessibility window titles in macOS Electron apps. This is a regression has been present since Electron 6.0.0 (the first release including the Chromium change above).",1

When we create a completely new BrowserView instance, it starts of as visible (even when it hasn't been added to the window), which means that it will need its own compositor instead of using the recycled compositor. To fix this, lets make BrowserViews hidden by default until they're added to the window. See also #19988. This is a potentially breaking change given that the initial value of document.visibilityState will now be hidden, but given the experimental status of BrowserViews, I think this is a fine change to make. The old behavior can be restored with webPreferences: { show: true }. Notes: Fix compositor recycling when creating new BrowserView",0

fix: prevent silent failure when DOM storage quota exceeded (#20899),0.7949765,Re-enable DOM storage quota enforcement but change limit from 10MiB to 100MiB. #21380,"test: update DOM storage quota limits test fix: update dom_storage_limits.patch (fixes #13465) The previous version of this patch did not include changes required to circumvent the quota enforcement performed by StorageAreaImpl. Consequently when the quota was exceeded, things still ""appeared to work"" at first but then would later fail silently. That is, the cache would be updated but the backing store would not. This could be fixed by disabling the code below (from content/browser/dom_storage/storage_area_impl.cc) // Only check quota if the size is increasing, this allows   // shrinking changes to pre-existing maps that are over budget.   if (new_item_size > old_item_size && new_storage_used > max_size_) {     if (map_state_ == MapState::LOADED_KEYS_ONLY) {       receivers_.ReportBadMessage(           ""The quota in browser cannot exceed when there is only one ""           ""renderer."");     } else {       std::move(callback).Run(false);     }     return;   } However, since this seems to have some unintended side-effects (see updated notes in dom_storage_limits.patch) it seems more prudent to simply increase the quota to a larger yet still reasonable size rather than attempt to circumvent the storage quota altogether.",1

Previously, we didn't consider the return value of the webRequest URLPattern mate converter, which meant that when the pattern wasn't correctly parsed owing to invalid filter specification users would not be made aware of that fact and would just think that the filtering itself had failed. This corrects that error by moving the business logic of url pattern parsing out of the converter and into the function itself so that granular and specific errors can be thrown. There's also no real reason that i'm aware of not to allow wider breadth of filters by letting users use a wildcard for effective TLD, so I also overrode that (default for the 1-arg Parse is not to allow that). Finally, I added some examples of url filter types for users to reference.",0

We want to keep default move conflict handling behavior in that it's still what most users would expect, but there exist edge cases in which users may not want to be forced into that behavior. This thus introduces an optional conflict handler that allows developers access to more granular move actions. They could now allow the user to choose whether to delete an existing app in favor of the current one being moved, or whether to quit the current app and focus on the existing one should it both exist and be running. I added a fair amount of new documentation outlining this behavior, but if there are things users may benefit from seeing examples of or nuances that should be added please leave feedback!",0

This is an issue ever since the backing APIs moved to worker threads.

fix: maintain a ref count for objects sent over remote (#17464),0.64137053,- Fix occasional exception when removing a reference to a remote object.,"spec: clean up after a failed window count assertion Previously when this assertion failed all tests that ran after the failed assertion also failed.  This ensure that the assertion fails for the test that actually caused the issue but cleans up the left-over windows so that future tests do not fail. fix: maintain a ref count for objects sent over remote Previously there was a race condition where a GC could occur in the renderer process between the main process sending a meta.id and the renderer pulling the proxy out its weakmap to stop it being GC'ed. This fixes that race condition by maintaining a ""sent"" ref count in the object registry and a ""received"" ref count in the object cache on the renderer side.  The deref request now sends the number of refs the renderer thinks it owns, if the number does not match the value in the object registry it is assumed that there is an IPC message containing a new reference in flight and this race condition was hit. The browser side ref count is then reduced and we wait for the new deref message.  This guaruntees that an object will only be removed from the registry if every reference we sent has been guarunteed to be unreffed.",0

fix: restore ability to disable color correct rendering (#15898),0.62163234,Backported a fix for crashing color picker dialogs on MacOS. #17254,"In Electron 2.0, --disable-features=ColorCorrectRendering could be used to make the app use the display color space (e.g. P3 on Macs) instead of color correcting to sRGB. Because color correct rendering is always enabled on Chromium 62 and later and because --force-color-profile has no effect on macOS, apps that need e.g. P3 colors are currently stuck on Electron 2.0. This restores the functionality removed in link in the form of the --disable-color-correct-rendering switch. This can be removed once web content (including WebGL) learn how to deal with color spaces. That is being tracked at link and link. As an example of a widely used app using --disable-features=ColorCorrectRendering, see VSCode: link Notes: Add --disable-color-correct-rendering switch",0

However, it sets the variable too late in the boot process: by the time that line in main.js has run, a child zygote has already been booted. test.py works around this by setting that environment variable outside of the test process, to ensure that it gets propagated to all children. I've been running the GN tests directly with ./out/Default/electron electron/spec, rather than through the wrapper script, and the api-debugger-spec.js tests were failing, because they depend on a particular log message being the first one emitted, and the CSP warning was causing that test to fail, since it wasn't being correctly suppressed.

perf: don't use JSON to send the result of ipcRenderer.sendSync. (#8953),0.83464307,[#8953] feat: no longer use JSON to send the result of ipcRenderer.sendSync,"Don't use JSON to send the result of ipcRenderer.sendSync. Change the return type of AtomViewHostMsg_Message_Sync from base::string16   to base::ListValue Adjust lib/browser/api/web-contents.js and /lib/renderer/api/ipc-renderer.js   to wrap/unwrap return values to/from array, instead of   serializing/deserializing JSON. This change can greatly improve ipcRenderer.sendSync calls where the return value contains Buffer instances, because those are converted to Array before being serialized to JSON(which has no efficient way of representing byte arrays). A simple benchmark where remote.require('fs') was used to read a 16mb file got at least 5x faster, not to mention it used a lot less memory.  This difference tends increases with larger buffers.

Exit gracefully on linux (#12139),0.9508167,Exit gracefully on linux. #12139,"Fix timing issue in singleton fixture. Singleton now sends the ""we've started"" message out only after it's received a 'ready' event from app. Previously it sent the message out immediately, resulting in the parent test trying to manipulate it before Singleton's event loop was fully bootstrapped. Check for graceful exits on Linux, too. Rewrite the ""exits gracefully on macos"" spec to run on Linux too. Check for graceful exits everywhere. Tweak comment Better error logging in api-app-spec.js. (#12122) In the 'exits gracefully' test for app.exit(exitCode), print the relevant error information if the test fails. Run the exit-gracefully test on macOS and Linux. Windows does not support sending signals, but Node.js offers some emulation with process.kill(), and subprocess.kill(). Sending signal 0 can be used to test for the existence of a process. Sending SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL cause the unconditional termination of the target process. So, we'll need a different approach if we want to test this in win32.",1

Special attribute for macOS accessibility #7206,0.5663828,Exposed an API to allow apps to determine their status as a trusted accessibility client. #16119,"In the linked issue we were discussing that Electron apps are inaccessible unless VoiceOver is enabled. While it's a working solution for users with vision impairment, all other users and apps that require accessibility can't interact with Electron-based software because they don't keep VoiceOver running. I suggest adding AXManualAccessibility for programmatically enabling it in Electron apps. The reason for a new attribute is that AXEnhancedUserInterface is already reserved by VoiceOver. Adding this attribute will allow both Electron developers and 3rd party developers to enable and disable accessibility from their code by calling accessibilitySetValue:forAttribute: on the application. It will be also possible to create a small utility app to switch accessibility in Electron-based apps until there's a native UI solution (like the accessibility settings page in Chrome).",0

Let Chromium manage document.visibilityState and document.hidden,0.6233511,- Fix wrong document.hidden and document.visibilityState values when window is minimized.,"Chromium already includes the necessary plumbing to manage the visibility properties and visibilitychange event so this gets rid of most of our custom logic for BrowserWindow and BrowserView. Note that webview remains unchanged and is still affected by the issues listed below. User facing changes: The document visibility properties and visibilitychange event are   now also updated/fired in response to occlusion changes on macOS. In   other words, document.visibilityState will now be hidden on macOS   if the window is occluded by another window. Previously, visibilitychange was also fired by both Electron and   Chromium in some cases (e.g. when hiding the window). Now it is only   fired by Chromium so you no longer get duplicate events. The visiblity state of BrowserWindows created with { show: false }   is now initially visible until the window is shown and hidden. The visibility state of BrowserWindows with backgroundThrottling   disabled is now permanently visible. This should also fix #6860 (but not for webview).",0

For example, Symantec translated digital certificate as 數位憑證; Chrome Support used the teams 憑證授權單位 and SSL 憑證 to describe CA and SSL Certificate. These are all proving that the word 憑證 is commonly used in the translation of certificate, but not license I googled for a while, and found that the team 授權條款 is commonly used to describe license in Traditional Chinese. The user of the translation 授權條款 includes governments (Taiwan Government, Hong Kong government), communities (Open Source Hong Kong and OpenFoundry), and businesses (Google).

For us at Figma, the main issue is very slow performance. Despite the upstream improvements to  through the OOPIF work, it is probable that there will continue to be -specific bugs in the future. Therefore, this introduces a  alternative to called BrowserView, which... is a thin wrapper around api::WebContents (so bugs in BrowserView will   likely also be bugs in BrowserWindow web contents) is instantiated in the main process like BrowserWindow (and unlike   , which lives in the DOM of a BrowserWindow web contents) needs to be added to a BrowserWindow to display something on the screen This implements the most basic API. The API is expected to evolve and change in the near future and has consequently been marked as experimental. Please do not use this API in production unless you are prepared to deal with breaking changes. In the future, we will want to change the API to support multiple BrowserViews per window.

Prevent undefined behavior when some Node Buffer objects are destroyed,0.6313139,- Fix memory leak when calling node::Buffer::New.,"If node::Buffer::New() is used to wrap an existing chunk of memory without providing a custom callback to release that memory then Node will just use free(). In a couple of places Node buffer objects were constructed from chunks of memory that were allocated with new[], but a custom callback to release that memory was omitted, this resulted in undefined behavior when those buffers were destroyed because free() was used to release memory allocated with new[]. To avoid undefined behavior the aforementioned buffer objects are now constructed with a custom callback that safely releases the underlying chunk of memory.",0

Override child_process.execFile asar patch for child_process.exec,0.79057395,- Fix child_process.execFile not working for files in asar archive.,"NodeJS implements child_process.exec by simply passing the whole command to child_process.execFile. See: link link Electron patches child_process.execFile to add support for asar archives by injecting logic that extracts the required files from the asar to a temporary location before delegating the work to the original child_process.execFile. In order to decide whether to inject the custom asar extracting logic, Electron makes use of a helper function called splitPath(). See: link If the first argument of the returned array equals true, means that the path is considered to be an asar archive, and thus the extraction logic takes place. The problem is that if the command passed to child_process.execFile contains a path to an asar archive, padded with other commands/arguments, splitPath() will consider it to be an asar archive, and will try to extract it, throwing a rightfully Invalid package error.

Extend NativeWindow to track touch-based scroll events on OS X,0.7065153,- Add scroll-touch-begin and scroll-touch-end events to BrowserWindow.,"In N1, we want to implement the famous ""swipe to archive"" action on threads in the user's inbox. Chrome exposes scroll and wheel events, but these aren't sufficient to implement the interaction because the element needs to ""snap"" when the user lifts their fingers from the trackpad, not when they / we stop receiving wheel / scroll events. These events may stop before the user lifts their fingers, or continue after the user has lifted their fingers if they had enough momentum for the gesture to continue. This exposes BrowserWindow scroll-touch-down and scroll-touch-up, which fire immeditaely when the user touches two fingers to the trackpad, and again when the user lifts their fingers. Combined with the existing wheel event should allow for ""swipe-to-archive"" and other similar interactions.

:checkered_flag: Preserve file extension when extracting from asar,0.58607537,- Add support for asar archive with unpacked files.,"Currently, when calling copyFileOut, the original extension from the file is lost, and a generic .tmp is added instead. This becomes problematic in the scenario where we use child_process.execFile on a Windows Batch script that lives inside the asar package. Windows relies on the extension being present in order to interpret the script accordingly, which results in the following bug because the operating system doesn't know what do to with this .tmp file: Error: spawn UNKNOWN Steps to reproduce: Create a dummy batch script (test.bat): @echo off echo ""Hello world"" Create an electron app that attemps to call this script with child_process.execFile: module Package this small application as an asar archive: ```sh asar pack mytestapp app.asar ``` Execute the application: ```sh electron.exe app.asar ```",0

:bug: Fix missing execution permission bit in execFile override,0.5842558,- Fix child_process.execFile unable to execute files in asar archive.,"Consider an electron application that uses execFile to run a script that lives within the application code base: coffee child_process = require 'child_process' child_process.execFile __dirname + '/script.sh', (error) ->   throw error if error? An application like this will fail when being packaged in an asar with an following error: Error: spawn EACCES Electron overrides certain fs functions to make them work within an asar package. In the case of execFile, the file to be executed is extracted from the asar package into a temporary file and ran from there. The problem is that during the extraction, the original permissions of the file are lost. We workaround this by: Extending asar.stat to return whether a file is executable or not,   which is information that's already saved in the asar header. Setting execution permissions on the extracted file if the above   property holds true. Fixes: link",0

This is happening because -Dtarget_arch=ia32 is passed to ninja on linux inside script/update.py which leads to '-DARCH=""ia32""' being set in the compile flags. I see that the current intention is to target 64 bit builds on linux (37275c64cd07) and the binaries are in fact compiled as 64 bit despite this bug.  I guess ninja is somehow smartly ignoring the incorrect setting of the -m32 flags at link.

Especially when we return NSTerminateLater for shouldTerminate, it would be impossible for the C++ message loop to quit, because unless we explictly let NSApp terminate the application, the message loop would think the application is not terminated and will run forever. The fix is to simply ignore the Cocoa's application termination request and let the C++ message loop deal with it compeletey. But we had the side effect that atom-shell would always cancel OS X's shutdown request, this is also the approach chosen by Chromium. Fixes #229. Fixes atom/atom#1864.",1
