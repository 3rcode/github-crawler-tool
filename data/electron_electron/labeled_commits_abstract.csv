Specifically this changes the account name for app ""My App"" from ""My App"" to ""My App AppStore"" if the app is using a MAS build of Electron. We attempt to migrate the safe storage key from the old account, if that migration succeeds we delete the old key and move on. Existing apps that aren't built for the app store should be unimpacted, there is one edge case where a user uses BOTH an AppStore and a darwin build of the same app only one will keep it's access to the safestorage key as during the migration we delete the old account.  This is an acceptable edge case as no one should be actively using two versions of the same app.",0

This allows users to authenticate without first having to select or type a username. To decide if discoverable credentials are supported, the class 'AuthenticatorCommon', in the chrome content code, indirectly calls the method 'context::WebAuthenticationDelegate.SupportsResidentKeys(..)'. The default implementation of this returns false, leaving it up to specific implementations to override. This change adds a new class 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate' to subclass 'WebAuthenticationDelegate' and override the behaviour of the 'SupportsResidentKeys' method to return true. The implementation is copied from the Chrome browser equivalent 'ChromeWebAuthenticationDelegate', though the chrome class includes other methods that don't seem to be required for this functionality. The 'ElectronContentClient' class was also updated to store an instance of 'ElectronWebAuthenticationDelegate', and to provide an accessor method, GetWebAuthenticationDelegate().

One define ""ELECTRON_ENSURE_CONFIG_GYPI"" is set via common.gypi which is already used to build native modules and has been since the dawn of time.  Therefore this define will be set for all native module compilations targetting the Electron runtime.  The second define ""USING_ELECTRON_CONFIG_GYPI"" is only defined when the gypi argument ""using_electron_config_gypi"" is set to 1 which is only done so via config.gypi.  Only new enough versions of node-gyp correctly use the config.gypi file thus resulting in a compilation error on version of node-gyp that are too old. chore: fix lint Co-authored-by: Samuel Attard sattard@salesforce.com",0

874,linux: Fix wrong off_t type under 32bit arch,0.66279685,- Fix wrong process.arch on 32bit Linux.,"fix: performance problem in crashReporter.start() on macOS This change reduces the duration of crashReporter.start() on Intel macOS from 622 milliseconds to 257 milliseconds! Backports link posix: Replace DoubleForkAndExec() with ForkAndSpawn() The DoubleForkAndExec() function was taking over 622 milliseconds to run   on macOS 11 (BigSur) on Intel i5-1038NG7. I did some debugging by adding   some custom traces and found that the fork() syscall is the bottleneck   here, i.e., the first fork() takes around 359 milliseconds and the   nested fork() takes around 263 milliseconds. Replacing the nested fork()   and exec() with posix_spawn() reduces the time consumption to 257   milliseconds! See link to know why fork() is so   slow on macOS and why posix_spawn() is a better replacement. Another point to note is that even base::LaunchProcess() from Chromium   calls posix_spawnp() on macOS -   link Change-Id: I25c6ee9629a1ae5d0c32b361b56a1ce0b4b0fd26   Reviewed-on: link   Reviewed-by: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org   Commit-Queue: Mark Mentovai mark@chromium.org Fixes: link Signed-off-by: Darshan Sen raisinten@gmail.com",0

For space reasons, our Electron.js fork running on CircleCI deletes the .git directories as upstream Electron.js does here: link If the C++ linter is ran after deleting git directories, cpplint.py gets the root wrong and throws errors for every single header guard in the project. Making sure we run the C++ linter before deleting git directories fixes the issue. In any case, this commit always manually passes --project_root to cpplint.py so that the implicit default is explicitly declared and saves some confusion for the next person hitting this.

1902,Update to Electron v1.4.0,0.8385103,  after the time of the Electron release. Electron versions 1.4.0 - 1.4.11 are,"feat: Allow detection of MITM HTTPS proxies like ZScaler For security purposes, Figma heavily restrics the origins that are allowed to load within our Electron app. Unfortunately some corporate environments use MITM proxies like ZScaler, which intercepts our connection to link and serves a redirect to e.g. link before finally redirecting back to link. In order to detect this situation and handle it gracefully, we need to be able to know whether or not the certificate for our own origin (link) is chained to a known root. We do this by exposesing CertVerifyResult::is_issued_by_known_root. If the certification verification passed without the certificate being tied to a known root, we can safely assume that we are dealing with a MITM proxy that has its root CA installed locally on the machine. This means that HTTPS can't be trusted so we might as well make life easier for corporate users by loosening our origin restrictions without any manual steps. Tweak docs wording",1

The tests still run fine on linux machine in Electron's pipeline setup on CircleCI, because the docker image used has the non-broken version of python-dbusmock for python2 installed. But running electron tests on any other linux machine would fail if they don't have this non-broken version of python-dbusmock for python2 installed, already, which is the case for most of the machines. Moreover, Python2 is deprecated now. So it would be better if we change the python interpreter in script/spec-runner.js file to python3, for which all the python modules are updated and working.

This does not mean request was finished even though it received headers (from proxy, not the destination server), so prevent ""completing"" and most importantly deleting it, which causes request to be canceled in network layer. Just continue to monitor it and await proper response from server. Also add circut breaker to cancel request if proxy auth failed 3 times (for example user keeps cancelling auth).

One of the examples of such calls is window.open() which is possible to invoke while uv_run() is still running (e.g. with setImmediate()). All in all, it doesn't matter that much which policy we use since v8::MicrotasksScope has a check for the policy in its destructor and no commits will be made if the policy is kExplicit. It is important, however, to not change the policy in the middle of UvRunOnce() so we should respect whatever we currently have and move on.

The typescript compiler will let anything declared via const or class be used as a value.  Unfortunately we were exporting a bunch of things (see the diff) as class/const when they weren't actually exported values. This lead to typescript being happy but the runtime throwing errors (not something we want). This change passes ""exported-in"" context through our docs, to the parser and then to the definitions generator to ensure we only mark things as exported in the ts defs that we actually export.

Chromium 75 changed to Apple's newer accessibility API for window titles in the super class that AtomNSWindow inherits from. macOS still supports both the old and new style APIs, but it will prefer the new style if it is implemented.  This means the Electron window title is being ignored because the newer API at the Chromium level has taken precedence. By implementing the newer accessibility API in AtomNSWindow, this restores correct accessibility window titles in macOS Electron apps. This is a regression has been present since Electron 6.0.0 (the first release including the Chromium change above).",0

When we create a completely new BrowserView instance, it starts of as visible (even when it hasn't been added to the window), which means that it will need its own compositor instead of using the recycled compositor. To fix this, lets make BrowserViews hidden by default until they're added to the window. See also #19988. This is a potentially breaking change given that the initial value of document.visibilityState will now be hidden, but given the experimental status of BrowserViews, I think this is a fine change to make. The old behavior can be restored with webPreferences: { show: true }. Notes: Fix compositor recycling when creating new BrowserView",1

Consequently when the quota was exceeded, things still ""appeared to work"" at first but then would later fail silently. That is, the cache would be updated but the backing store would not. This could be fixed by disabling the code below (from content/browser/dom_storage/storage_area_impl.cc) // Only check quota if the size is increasing, this allows   // shrinking changes to pre-existing maps that are over budget.   if (new_item_size > old_item_size && new_storage_used > max_size_) {     if (map_state_ == MapState::LOADED_KEYS_ONLY) {       receivers_.ReportBadMessage(           ""The quota in browser cannot exceed when there is only one ""           ""renderer."");     } else {       std::move(callback).Run(false);     }     return;   } However, since this seems to have some unintended side-effects (see updated notes in dom_storage_limits.patch) it seems more prudent to simply increase the quota to a larger yet still reasonable size rather than attempt to circumvent the storage quota altogether.",0

Previously, we didn't consider the return value of the webRequest URLPattern mate converter, which meant that when the pattern wasn't correctly parsed owing to invalid filter specification users would not be made aware of that fact and would just think that the filtering itself had failed. This corrects that error by moving the business logic of url pattern parsing out of the converter and into the function itself so that granular and specific errors can be thrown. There's also no real reason that i'm aware of not to allow wider breadth of filters by letting users use a wildcard for effective TLD, so I also overrode that (default for the 1-arg Parse is not to allow that). Finally, I added some examples of url filter types for users to reference.",0

We want to keep default move conflict handling behavior in that it's still what most users would expect, but there exist edge cases in which users may not want to be forced into that behavior. This thus introduces an optional conflict handler that allows developers access to more granular move actions. They could now allow the user to choose whether to delete an existing app in favor of the current one being moved, or whether to quit the current app and focus on the existing one should it both exist and be running.

This is an issue ever since the backing APIs moved to worker threads.

This fixes that race condition by maintaining a ""sent"" ref count in the object registry and a ""received"" ref count in the object cache on the renderer side.  The deref request now sends the number of refs the renderer thinks it owns, if the number does not match the value in the object registry it is assumed that there is an IPC message containing a new reference in flight and this race condition was hit. The browser side ref count is then reduced and we wait for the new deref message.  This guaruntees that an object will only be removed from the registry if every reference we sent has been guarunteed to be unreffed.",0

Because color correct rendering is always enabled on Chromium 62 and later and because --force-color-profile has no effect on macOS, apps that need e.g. P3 colors are currently stuck on Electron 2.0. This restores the functionality removed in link in the form of the --disable-color-correct-rendering switch. This can be removed once web content (including WebGL) learn how to deal with color spaces. That is being tracked at link and link.

However, it sets the variable too late in the boot process: by the time that line in main.js has run, a child zygote has already been booted. test.py works around this by setting that environment variable outside of the test process, to ensure that it gets propagated to all children. I've been running the GN tests directly with ./out/Default/electron electron/spec, rather than through the wrapper script, and the api-debugger-spec.js tests were failing, because they depend on a particular log message being the first one emitted, and the CSP warning was causing that test to fail, since it wasn't being correctly suppressed.

This change can greatly improve ipcRenderer.sendSync calls where the return value contains Buffer instances, because those are converted to Array before being serialized to JSON(which has no efficient way of representing byte arrays). A simple benchmark where remote.require('fs') was used to read a 16mb file got at least 5x faster, not to mention it used a lot less memory.  This difference tends increases with larger buffers.

While it's a working solution for users with vision impairment, all other users and apps that require accessibility can't interact with Electron-based software because they don't keep VoiceOver running. I suggest adding AXManualAccessibility for programmatically enabling it in Electron apps. The reason for a new attribute is that AXEnhancedUserInterface is already reserved by VoiceOver. Adding this attribute will allow both Electron developers and 3rd party developers to enable and disable accessibility from their code by calling accessibilitySetValue:forAttribute: on the application. It will be also possible to create a small utility app to switch accessibility in Electron-based apps until there's a native UI solution (like the accessibility settings page in Chrome).",1

Note that webview remains unchanged and is still affected by the issues listed below. User facing changes: The document visibility properties and visibilitychange event are   now also updated/fired in response to occlusion changes on macOS. In   other words, document.visibilityState will now be hidden on macOS   if the window is occluded by another window. Previously, visibilitychange was also fired by both Electron and   Chromium in some cases (e.g. when hiding the window). Now it is only   fired by Chromium so you no longer get duplicate events. The visiblity state of BrowserWindows created with { show: false }   is now initially visible until the window is shown and hidden. The visibility state of BrowserWindows with backgroundThrottling   disabled is now permanently visible. This should also fix #6860 (but not for webview).",1

For example, Symantec translated digital certificate as 數位憑證; Chrome Support used the teams 憑證授權單位 and SSL 憑證 to describe CA and SSL Certificate. These are all proving that the word 憑證 is commonly used in the translation of certificate, but not license I googled for a while, and found that the team 授權條款 is commonly used to describe license in Traditional Chinese. The user of the translation 授權條款 includes governments (Taiwan Government, Hong Kong government), communities (Open Source Hong Kong and OpenFoundry), and businesses (Google). So I suggest we should use 授權條款, which has been widely adopted  as translation of license, instead of a wrong translation 憑證.",1

Unfortunately  suffers from a number of problems. To make matters worse, many of these are upstream Chromium bugs instead of Electron-specific bugs. For us at Figma, the main issue is very slow performance. Despite the upstream improvements to  through the OOPIF work, it is probable that there will continue to be -specific bugs in the future. Therefore, this introduces a  alternative to called BrowserView, which... is a thin wrapper around api::WebContents (so bugs in BrowserView will   likely also be bugs in BrowserWindow web contents) is instantiated in the main process like BrowserWindow (and unlike   , which lives in the DOM of a BrowserWindow web contents) needs to be added to a BrowserWindow to display something on the screen This implements the most basic API. The API is expected to evolve and change in the near future and has consequently been marked as experimental. Please do not use this API in production unless you are prepared to deal with breaking changes. In the future, we will want to change the API to support multiple BrowserViews per window. We will also want to consider z-ordering auto-resizing, and possibly even nested views.",1

See: link link Electron patches child_process.execFile to add support for asar archives by injecting logic that extracts the required files from the asar to a temporary location before delegating the work to the original child_process.execFile. In order to decide whether to inject the custom asar extracting logic, Electron makes use of a helper function called splitPath(). See: link If the first argument of the returned array equals true, means that the path is considered to be an asar archive, and thus the extraction logic takes place. The problem is that if the command passed to child_process.execFile contains a path to an asar archive, padded with other commands/arguments, splitPath() will consider it to be an asar archive, and will try to extract it, throwing a rightfully Invalid package error.

The API could also be on the BrowserWindow (eg BrowserWindow.setSheetOffset). I don't have a strong preference, but I think it's more discoverable on the dialog module.",1

NSImageView normally uses the correct color for template images magicaly, but I think the addition of event handlers in the container view prevents the image view from determining highlight state.

The drawRect function decides whether to use image or alternateImage(pressed image) and then if that image is marked as a template, it fills it with the same color used for the text before drawing it.",0

These events may stop before the user lifts their fingers, or continue after the user has lifted their fingers if they had enough momentum for the gesture to continue. This exposes BrowserWindow scroll-touch-down and scroll-touch-up, which fire immeditaely when the user touches two fingers to the trackpad, and again when the user lifts their fingers. Combined with the existing wheel event should allow for ""swipe-to-archive"" and other similar interactions.

I see that the current intention is to target 64 bit builds on linux (37275c64cd07) and the binaries are in fact compiled as 64 bit despite this bug.  I guess ninja is somehow smartly ignoring the incorrect setting of the -m32 flags at link.

Especially when we return NSTerminateLater for shouldTerminate, it would be impossible for the C++ message loop to quit, because unless we explictly let NSApp terminate the application, the message loop would think the application is not terminated and will run forever. The fix is to simply ignore the Cocoa's application termination request and let the C++ message loop deal with it compeletey.
