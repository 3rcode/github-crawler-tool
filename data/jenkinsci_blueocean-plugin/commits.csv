It is possible for multiple files of the same name to be collected but under different artifact paths.

It effectively ends up loading all the builds for a certain job. This causes delays of sometimes several hours in scheduling jobs when load is high. NPE when queued items can't be found in the queue.  This tends to happen more on startup. The reason for removing this code is basically like this.  When a queue item that is blocked, waiting, etc. passes through here, the codepath appears to always return null.  This is becuase the queue item has not yet become a build and thus there is no entry in the job's build list.  The one I've found case where this does work is when the queue item leaves the queue (becomes a LeftItem).  At that point, it has been assigned a run number, and this code does work.  However, logically at that point this is no longer an expected build number.  It's an actual build number.  The regular build id logic in the blue ocean UI should take over at that point.

adjust layout of buttons to wrap correctly add semantic classes to github creation elements so tests don't break after label changes ensure the credential ID for github enterprise is ""github-enterprise"" rather than github (to avoid duplicate ID's) add specific logic to handle the case where the user-supplied URL is malformed ensure the credential ID for github enterprise is ""github-enterprise"" rather than github (to avoid duplicate ID's) add specific logic to handle the case where the user-supplied URL is malformed also check for UnknownHostException add support for ""GitHub Enterprise URL"" field and handle relevant errors; still needs some UI layout refinement also check for UnknownHostException pass through empty string so it results in invalid URL error from backend (rather than allowing it to default to public github API URL) refine layout ensure ""apiUrl"" parameter is not passed during public GitHub creation flow first pass at reworking GitHubEnterpriseScm to support multiple credentials stored in ""blueocean-github-enterprise-domain"" - need to investigate numerous test regressions push most logic for custom apiUrl back into GithubScm but make it required in GithubEnterpriseScm better test coverage for Github Enterprise token validation clean imports add functional test for token validaton error; add testing utility to allow for user / domain credentials to be deleted rework GithubEnterpriseScm so that apiUrl is a required parameter and drives 404 vs 200 behavior on GET requests fix findbugs NPE warning suppress type warning simplify apiUrl logic fix findbugs NPE violation hash the apiUrl portion of the credentialId using SHA-256 hex GitHub Enterprise credentials should start with ""github-enterprise""  (scm.ID) rather than the credential domain's name just look up the credential explicitly via credentialId; remove the new CredentialUtils.findCredentials method added in this PR since it's no longer necessary remove wildcard imports add @Nonnull return type to createCredentialId() make credential description overridable so that ""GitHub Enterprise Access Token"" is used for GHE return 200 with null credentialId rather than 404 work-in-progress for looking up existing GHE credential add a utility class / function for transforming REST API URL's to include the ""apiUrl"" param cleaner init update Github*Api's to append apiUrl in appropriate places isolate GHE custom behavior to a FlowManager subclass make the ""existing token will be used"" scenario nicer ensure the apiUrl is being passed to the final creation call in GHE scenario make the final creation endpoint handle URL's with trailing slashes gracefully Enumerate Github Servers (#1190) wip of new ""choose server"" step and ""add server"" dialog add getApiUrl() so it can be easily overriden allow the location of credentials step and organizations step to be more easily controlled API for github enterprise ""servers"" backend report the error message back to client finish up ""add server"" dialog; add some utilities for dealing with backend error messages and rendering them wire up the ""next"" button in ""Choose Server"" step to proceed to access token or organizations step revert changes related to first draft of UI for GHE credential / apiUrl management revert changes related to first draft of UI for GHE credential / apiUrl management fix bug where generic error message was showing inappropriately in ""invalid URL"" case revert changes related to first draft of UI for GHE credential / apiUrl management fix broken unit test for Enum Add a proxy for Github.com to simulate Github Enterprise add back the ""apiUrl"" parameter that was mistakening removed improve the error message when unexpected exception is thrown connecting to GHE server; fix broken test Find/replace all urls Find/replace all urls v2 use password field for github token fix a bug where step indicators were not styled appropriately due status classes not forced to lowercase (with unit test) improve docs for Enum and add some test coverage make class names in GHE ""Choose Server"" step more specific add some Selenium-based utilities for conditions and text field manipulation temp workaround code to allow servers with the ""same"" API URL to be created by appending random query string param first draft of reusable utility for working with GitHub repos from automated tests; needs a bunch of refinement to more flexible use new ""clearText"" utility method basic ATH coverage for GitHub Enterprise: create a new server, finish creation, open in editor ensure repo name w/ random suffix is used write a utility to extract protocol / host from a URL ensure the link to create the GitHub personal access token points to the correct hostname (either github.com or GHE) me fail english? that's unpossible!"

This all means that we no longer need to create HPIs for these bundles (or most of them anyway - can still if we need to). Instead, each plugin will bundle its own dependencies. At runtime, if that dependency has not already been loaded by another plugin, js-modules will trigger loading of the dep from the adjunct url. js-builder generates the dep bundle such that it ends up being bundled in the HPI. So, multiple plugins may end up having the same js bundles (generated by js-builder), but that's ok as we include the version number in the URL. At the moment, we blank out the patch version, which means we always treat e.g. v3.2.1 as being compatible with v3.2.9, but do not treat v3.2.1 and v3.3.1 as being compatible. Hope this makes sense.","[UX-239] Smoother ""externalised"" JS dependencies","js-builder now looks for ""extDependencies"" in the ""jenkinscd"" section of the package.json and generates adjunct js-module bundles for the dependencies specified in their. js-modules triggers async loading from the same adjunct urls.

We could have defined a new permission here if we wanted, but Jenkins.ADMINISTER is sufficient. AuthorizationStrategy allows any user to have the god access on himself/herself, so anyone can read any information about himself. What this allow you to do, in addition, is that for example when CJP RBAC plugin is in place, there can be ops team lead ""ben"" account that has ADMINISTER permission on every User object, and those decision making logic is decoupled from the application logic.",This is a good example of how access control works in Jenkins,"If the identity that's making the HTTP call has a specific permission (in this case Jenkins.ADMINISTER = god access) in the eyes of the currently installed AuthorizationStrategy, then this check returns true.
