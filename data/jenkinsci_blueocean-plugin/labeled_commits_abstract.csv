It is possible for multiple files of the same name to be collected but under different artifact paths.  This change fixes a conflict of the unique ID field where artifacts with the same name but different paths should have a unique ID. By having a unique ID, all artifacts will be shown in the Blue Ocean UI. Compare the following discrepencies of artifacts being listed in these two URLs. link/ (complete artifact list) link   (incomplete artifact list) Note: test-suite.log is a file with the same name collected under different paths.

It effectively ends up loading all the builds for a certain job. This causes delays of sometimes several hours in scheduling jobs when load is high. NPE when queued items can't be found in the queue.  This tends to happen more on startup. The reason for removing this code is basically like this.  When a queue item that is blocked, waiting, etc. passes through here, the codepath appears to always return null.  This is becuase the queue item has not yet become a build and thus there is no entry in the job's build list.  The one I've found case where this does work is when the queue item leaves the queue (becomes a LeftItem).  At that point, it has been assigned a run number, and this code does work.  However, logically at that point this is no longer an expected build number.  It's an actual build number.  The regular build id logic in the blue ocean UI should take over at that point. Now, it's entirely possible that I missed a crucial case here.  However, the getRun code is undoubtedly incorrect as it is extremely inefficient. Check for null job_run_queueId Check job event, if its running then simply return run id",0

Not needed to depend on blueocean-events Remove Java APIs from dashboard We want dashboard to be composed with any java implementation. It should avoid depending on any java specific backend implementation. Disable JWT for now Add api route only if not already added to avoid re-write Fixed urlconfig import [bs-poc] Implement fetching via the core fetch function instead the default sjax function from XHRBackend Turn on JWT token by default Tested with default Jenkins authentication (with anonymous read) and Github authentication/authorization sgtrategy. No regression noticed. To turn off, set JVM set JVMP property DBLUEOCEAN_FEATURE_JWT_AUTHENTICATION to false. e.g. mvn hpi:run -DBLUEOCEAN_FEATURE_JWT_AUTHENTICATION=false JwtTokenVeriffier extension point to let others verify token ApiRoutable needs to honor its extension ordinals Abstracted away the mapping between ItemGroups and BlueOrganization So far BlueOcean has assumed that there's only one org in Jenkins and that's named 'jenkins', but this prevents others from defining different mappings, like I'm trying to do right now. This introduces an abstraction that the rest of BlueOcean can use to map name to organization, then Item/ItemGroup/etc <-> BlueOrganization Allow the name to be changed by a subtype JWT sign and verify extension points Fix to comput node/step/log base url using organization Fixed tests Further improvement to JWT token signing Do not try and create our own ""session id"" when one exists in Jenkins. More JWT improvements Minor simplification This URL should be available for user w/o overall read access Those users should still be able to get a token that represents them. This is not a JWT token, but rather just key ID Revisited abstractino around signing key selection JwtSigningKeyProvider is responsible for deciding which key is used to   sign the token, then later translate back that ID to its public key in   order for us to do validation. With that, JwkService no longer need to be an extension point since   the newly introduced SigningPublicKey is sufficient. JwtToken shouldn't be an ExtensionPoint given that there will be a   lot of instances of this. In comparision, @Extension is a marker for   singleton. Oops, compilation problem! Doc improvements Support for JwtTokenServiceEndpoint Moved the token validation logic to servlet filter ... in order to: Clear out context at the end to avoid contaminating other requests   that the thread will process later Pave way for SSE proxy to use JWT token for authentication, which is   necessary for us to be able to proxy the request to masters. JWT service endpoint fetched from config Released @jenkins-cd/blueocean-core-js@0.0.90-BSPOC4. Compilation fixes Wrong registration scheme @Extension component is not instantiated until someone asks for it Implement JwtAuthenticationStore to avoid this work around. javadoc fix Set previous security context if there Use crepto secure token id Also clears authentication instance if token is expired Updated blueocean-core-js Turn off JWT till fetching artifact and log start working Added blueocean-events to aggregator pom This should pull in all sse dependencies correctly. blueocean-core-js release dance",0

This all means that we no longer need to create HPIs for these bundles (or most of them anyway - can still if we need to). Instead, each plugin will bundle its own dependencies. At runtime, if that dependency has not already been loaded by another plugin, js-modules will trigger loading of the dep from the adjunct url. js-builder generates the dep bundle such that it ends up being bundled in the HPI. So, multiple plugins may end up having the same js bundles (generated by js-builder), but that's ok as we include the version number in the URL. At the moment, we blank out the patch version, which means we always treat e.g. v3.2.1 as being compatible with v3.2.9, but do not treat v3.2.1 and v3.3.1 as being compatible.
