Index,Release Note,Release Note Abstract
1,"This release adds TLS/HTTPS support to hugo server (see cf38c73f and #11064  for details) entirely backed by mkcert. We still default to http which is recommended and good enough for 99% of the Hugo use, but there are some situations where you really need it.
We have added a new sub command and some new flags to hugo server to enable this:
```
Installs a local CA in the system root store. You only need to do this once.
hugo server trust
Generates locally-trusted certificates (if not already created) and starts the server with TLS/HTTPS enabled.
hugo server --tlsAuto
```
Note that we just delegate to mkcert using its default settings, so all of their documentation is relevant. 
Also note that this is currently only supported for Linux, MacOS and Windows. And if you install on Linux using Snap, you will currently get an access denied error when running hugo server trust. A workaround for that, or if you need to use some of mkcert's advanced options, is to use mkcert directly to install the local CA:
go install filippo.io/mkcert@latest
mkcert -install
You can then start the server with hugo server --tlsAuto.
If you have obtained the TLS certificate and key file by other means, you can use the --tlsCertFile and --tlsKeyFile flags. When --tlsAuto or --tlsCertFile and --tlsKeyFile is set and no --baseURL is provided as a flag, the server is started with TLS and https as the protocol.","This release adds TLS/HTTPS support to hugo server (see cf38c73f and #11064  for details) entirely backed by mkcert.

TailwindCSS v3.x Support, new cache buster configuration

See https://github.com/bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic for a running example.

TailwindCSS 3 has been out for a while now, and unfortunately their new build strategy didn't work very well with Hugo. But this release adds a new build.cachebusters config option for the resource cache that allows more fine grained control over when to trigger a new Tailwind build. This is a generally useful feature, so if you're having issues not seeing your resource changes (e.g. change to a JS file) on change, you could try to tweak the defaults. A tip is to run the server with hugo server --debug and watch out for log messages prefixed with cachebuster: on file changes.
There are several possible setups here, but one that we have tested and that works well is outlined in the config below. The basic concept is to add hugo_stats.json to the server watcher list in Hugo and trigger a new TailwindCSS build only whenever either this file or the main CSS file changes.
```toml
[module]
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = ""assets""
    target = ""assets""
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = ""hugo_stats.json""
    target = ""assets/watching/hugo_stats.json""
[build]
  writeStats = true
  [[build.cachebusters]]
    source = ""assets/watching/hugo_stats\.json""
    target = ""styles\.css""
  [[build.cachebusters]]
    source = ""(postcss|tailwind)\.config\.js""
    target = ""css""
  [[build.cachebusters]]
    source = ""assets/.\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)""
    target = ""js""
  [[build.cachebusters]]
    source = ""assets/.\.(.*)$""
    target = ""$1""
```
And then in tailwind.config.js: 
js
module.exports = {
    content: ['./hugo_stats.json'],
};
Reconsolidated all configuration handling
For this release we have collected all configuration into one big Go struct and rewritten the command line API using SimpleCobra. All of this makes the source code easier to maintain and understand, but the original motivation for this was to get a complete and autogenerated API reference for Hugo (we're working on getting that done), but this also have some less technical upsides:
'hugo config' is now complete
What you get when running hugo config is a complete TOML representation (add --format json or --format yaml for alternative formats) of the effective configuration. As this will include default values and configuration merged in from themes, we don't recommend to copy and paste this into hugo.toml, as that would make your configuration very verbose.
Improved language config handling
See issue #10620 for some details, but in general, the merge behaviour of sections from languages is much improved. In the example below for language en you will now get:
json
 ""comments"": {
    ""color"": ""blue"",
    ""title"": ""English Comments Title"",
}
In earlier versions of Hugo you would get:
json
 ""comments"": {
    ""title"": ""English Comments Title"",
}
toml
title = ""Base Title""
staticDir = ""mystatic""
[params]
[params.comments]
color = ""blue""
title = ""Default Comments Title""
[languages]
[languages.en]
title = ""English Title""
[languages.en.params.comments]
title = ""English Comments Title""
Note that values in a given language will always have precedence over same keys in root (the section inside the language is the receiving side of any merge operation), so, if you want the old (and buggy) behaviour, you can add a merge strategy to one of the params sections, e.g:
toml
[languages.en.params.comments]
_merge = ""none""
title = ""English Comments Title""
You can now also configure just about everything per language. One useful example would be the Goldmark typographer extension:
toml
[languages.de]
languageCode = 'de-DE'
languageName = 'Deutsch'
weight = 2
[languages.de.markup.goldmark.extensions.typographer]
leftDoubleQuote = '&laquo;'   # default &ldquo;
rightDoubleQuote = '&raquo;'  # default &rdquo;
More info in verbose build output
If you build flag with the -v, you will now get timing info for the core building steps in Hugo:
INFO 2023/05/16 09:53:55 process in 17 ms
INFO 2023/05/16 09:53:55 assemble in 345 ms

We have deprecated site.Language.Params and configuration of custom params outside of the language [params], see https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#changes-in-hugo-01120 for more information.

Notable news
Page Fragments
We added the new .Fragments method on Page as part of the Related Content feature refresh (below), but it's plenty useful on its own, and has been long sought after by Hugo users.
It has many uses: Build table of contents, check if a page fragment (heading identifier) exists on a page, check for duplicate heading identifiers, start table of contents from a specific heading identifier. See the Hugo Documentation for more information
Indexing of Page Fragments in Related Content
We have reworked the Related Content API so it's now one method .Related that takes either a Page or an options map. We have also introduced a new type attribute on the index configuration with the new type fragments. See this for details, but to add some weight to the page titles in the Related Content configuration you can do this:
toml
[related]
threshold    = 20
includeNewer = true
toLower      = false
[[related.indices]]
name        = ""fragmentrefs""
type        = ""fragments""
applyFilter = false
weight = 50
See the Hugo Documentation for more.
Global page func
Note: There was a bug in this release that made this new feature not working, so you need to upgrade to Hugo 0.111.1. We blame it on Go.
Hugo almost always passes a Page as the data context into the top level template (e.g. single.html) (the one exception is the multihost sitemap template). This means that you can access the current page with the . variable in the template.
But when you're deeply nested inside .Render, partial etc., accessing that Page object isn't always practical or possible.
For this reason, Hugo now provides a global page function that you can use to access the current page from anywhere in any template.
go-html-template
{{ page.Title }}
Notes

For the Goldmark markdown hander, we now split parse and render for Goldmark. This was motivated by the new fragments support in Related Content, but it has some other side effects: If you only need a page's table of contents, we now skip the rendering step, which makes it faster, but it also means that you can access the page .Fragments structure from everywhere, even in render hooks  (271318ad @bep #10750)

Hugo v0.109.0 is the last release of 2022 – and with that we're wishing all of you a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year[^1].
Notable new features
Pass variables to SCSS/SASS
Hugo has had great SCSS/SASS support, but passing variables (e.g. theme colours from config) down to the transpiler has been much harder than it should.
In Hugo v0.109.0 we added a new vars option and you can finally just do:
handlebars
{{ $vars := dict ""color1"" ""blue"" ""color2"" ""green"" ""font_size"" ""24px"" }}
{{ $opts := (dict ""transpiler"" ""dartsass"" ""outputStyle"" ""compressed"" ""vars"" $vars ) }}
{{ $r := resources.Get ""scss/main.scss"" | toCSS $opts }}
And then in the SCSS file:
```scss
@use ""hugo:vars"" as v;
p {
    color: v.$color1;
    font-size: v.$font-size;
}
```
More examples here.
Hugo Module Workspaces
Workspace support was added in Go 1.18, and in this release Hugo finally gets solid support for it.
A common use case for a workspace is to simplify local development of a site with its theme modules.
A workspace can be configured in a *.work file and activated with the module.workspace setting, which for this use is commonly controlled via the HUGO_MODULE_WORKSPACE OS environment variable.
See the hugo.work file in the Hugo Docs repo for an example:
```
go 1.19
use .
use ../gohugoioTheme
```
Using the use directive, list all the modules you want to work on, pointing to its relative location. As in the example above, it's recommended to always include the main project (the ""."") in the list.
With that you can start the Hugo server with that workspace enabled:
HUGO_MODULE_WORKSPACE=hugo.work hugo server --ignoreVendorPaths ""**""
The --ignoreVendorPaths flag is added above to ignore any of the vendored dependencies inside _vendor. If you don't use vendoring, you don't need that flag. But now the server is set up watching the files and directories in the workspace and you can see your local edits reloaded.
Breadcrumbs
We have added a new .Ancestors method on Page that walks up the tree to the home page. With this, breadcrumbs templates can be greatly simplified:
```handlebars


    {{- range .Ancestors.Reverse }}
      {{ .Title }}
    {{- end }}
    
{{ .Title }}



```
The path to /public now available in PostCSS
So you can do  process.env.HUGO_PUBLISHDIR in your postcss.config.js to figure out where Hugo publishes
its files.
Note that the value will always be an absolute file path and will point to a directory on disk even when running hugo server in memory mode.
If you write to this folder from PostCSS when running the server, you could run the server with one of these flags:
hugo server --renderToDisk
hugo server --renderStaticToDisk
Note

modules: Make the module.workspace=off as default (note) 0d4b17d4 @bep #10553

Bug fixes

If you use the legacy libsass transpiler in toCSS and uses the cached build to avoid having the extended version installed on the CI server, you need to rebuild those assets and commit them to source control (e.g. with hugo --gc).

16,"With Hugo v0.108.0 you can render standalone Markdown images without a surrounding paragraph. Both the HTML- and CommonMark-specification defines image as an inline element. For Markdown, this has meant that if you put an image on its own (not inlined in another paragraph), it would be wrapped in <p></p> tags, even if you provide your own Render Hook Template.
Now you can get by this annoyance by setting markup.goldmark.parser.wrapStandAloneImageWithinParagraph = false
toml

  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.parser]
      wrapStandAloneImageWithinParagraph = false
      [markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
        block = true
In the above we have also enabled attribute support for Markdown blocks to illustrate another nice side effect of this; it's now possible to use Markdown attributes (e.g. CSS classes) on standalone images:
```md
This is an inline image: . Some more text.

{.blue}
```
The images in the above Markdown example would, given the hook template below, be rendered wrapped in a figure element with the blue CSS class applied in the latter example.
handlebars
{{ if .IsBlock }}<figure class=""{{ .Attributes.class }}""><img src=""{{ .Destination | safeURL }}"" alt=""{{ .Text }}"" /></figure>
{{ else }}<img src=""{{ .Destination | safeURL }}"" alt=""{{ .Text }}"" />{{ end }}
Two new fields are added to the render context passed to image render hooks:

IsBlock: Returns true if this is a standalone image and the config option markup.goldmark.parser.wrapStandAloneImageWithinParagraph is disabled.
Ordinal: Zero-based ordinal for all the images in the current document.

You can now use PostProcess'ed resources in all file types (e.g. JSON), not just HTML.
We have standardised the archive names for the release archives (as you can see further below). Hugo has since the first version used a rather odd and non-standard mixed case naming of the archive files (e.g. hugo_0.102.3_OpenBSD-64bit.tar.gz). We now use the standard GOOS/GOARCH values as-is, which makes it easier for people to script against. To avoid breakage when running on Netlify and similar, we create aliases for the most commonly downloaded Linux-archives on the old format and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.

This release adds Linux ARM64 extended archives (see issue #8257). If you look behind the scenes of this, you may say that ""this looks like a lot of work for one file"", but the current serial build setup was already closing in on the timeout limits of CircleCI (mostly because of the relatively resource-intensive extended build with CGO/webp/libsass). So, we eventually had to do something. This release is built using Hugoreleaser, a custom build tool that allows us to partition the build step. The Linux ARM64 binaries are built in its own Docker container, and we also get a general speedup of the entire build:

In Circle CI, this is how the release flow looks like:

In the above, build_container1 is doing most of the work and is configured with parallelism: 7 and partitioned using $CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL  and $CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX:

Notes

The MacOS archives have been replaced with universal/fat binaries that works on all MacOS platforms, named *macOS-universal.tar.gz.
These archives are removed: 32 bit Linux archives, Windows 32-bit and ARM, Linux ARM Deb. We may re-add some of these if enough people shout.

33,"$page.RenderString (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.100.0.
Indentation fixes for shortcode blocks: We now record the indentation before the opening shortcode tag when parsing the source. This allow us to fix a couple of annoying issues in Hugo:

We have added a new .InnerIndent method to the shortcode context to prevent the highlight shortcode from including in the indentation as part of the code block. See  #4717.
Hugo now preserves the indentation for shortcode blocks. See more below.

A shortcode block is when the shortcode is included as the first non-whitespace content on a line. Note that this does not touch shortcodes with inner content, where the user is in control of the indentation. See issue #9946 for more information. An example, say that I have this in layouts/shortcodes/mylist.md:
md
* Culpa enim incididunt fugiat id dolore velit laboris veniam minim.
* Tempor ex nisi labore ad elit laborum ex ullamco aute labore eu occaecat. 
* Deserunt mollit aliqua est laboris et irure eu non. 
* Consectetur nulla minim non reprehenderit Lorem elit dolore quis.
And then use that shortcode in a content file:
md
* My List
  {{% mylist %}}
In earlier versions of Hugo the above would render as:

Now it renders as:

Note that in the example above we use the md file suffix for the shortcode. In this release we also added Markdown as a built-in output format in Hugo, defined as a plain text format, meaning you get more lenient parsing compared to HTML. Using this if your shortcode produces Markdown has fewer quirks. See #9821.
Also noteworthy is the new template function resources.Copy which allows you to copy almost any Hugo Resource (the one exception is the Page), possibly most useful for renaming things:
htmlbars
{{ $resized := $image.Resize ""400x400"" |  resources.Copy ""images/mynewname.jpg"" } }}
<img src=""{{ $resized.RelPermalink }}"">
This release represents 32 contributions by 4 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @dependabot[bot], @satotake, and @moorereason for their ongoing contributions.

Notes

The methods on Page IsDescendant and IsAncestor now returns true for itself, which is obviously the correct behaviour. We have fixed this before, but reverted it because it broke some theme's logic. Looking back, that reversion was a mistake. If you want the old logic you can get that by doing somethiong ala {{ if or (eq $p1 $p2) ($p1.IsAncestor $p2) }}{{ end }} #9925
We have removed Blackfriday as a Markdown option. It has been deprecated for a long time, its v1 version is not maintained anymore, and there are many known issues. Goldmark should be a mature replacement by now. #9944

35,"The theme of this release is error handling – a topic grievously underrated in most development tools. You are often expected to Google this mysterious error and end up in some Stackoverflow thread telling you to use a specific Node version. Hugo has done an OK job in this department, but when I, @bep, recently got stuck with a minify error I had no clue how to debug, I knew we had to take another look at this. There is a list of ""error improvements below"",  but here is one visual example:

The two screenshots above is from the same template error in Hugo v0.98.0 (left) and the new v0.99.0 (right). This is a type error (method not found) in a partial included in a shortcode template. We did a decent job in v0.98.0, too, pointing at correct line in the partial. But the right version has the full stack, with absolute filename, line and column and some file context (highlighted lines) for all of the files involved in the error (Markdown file, shortcode and partial). Having these source file references to click on in the VS Code terminal is a real time saver, especially in Hugo projects with mulitiple file roots (themes, theme components).
A list of the most important ""error improvements"":

A new server error template (can be overridden in layouts/_server/error.html), always add the content file context if relevant, improve JS errors, Add file context (with position) to codeblock render blocks, add file context to errors in the publishing step (e.g. minify), and more.  #9892 #9891 #9893
Fix SIGINT handling (allowing to kill the server) after loading bad configuration #9664

","The theme of this release is error handling – a topic grievously underrated in most development tools. You are often expected to Google this mysterious error and end up in some Stackoverflow thread telling you to use a specific Node version. Hugo has done an OK job in this department, but when I, @bep, recently got stuck with a minify error I had no clue how to debug, I knew we had to take another look at this. There is a list of ""error improvements below"",  but here is one visual example:
The two screenshots above is from the same template error in Hugo v0.98.0 (left) and the new v0.99.0 (right). This is a type error (method not found) in a partial included in a shortcode template. We did a decent job in v0.98.0, too, pointing at correct line in the partial. But the right version has the full stack, with absolute filename, line and column and some file context (highlighted lines) for all of the files involved in the error (Markdown file, shortcode and partial). Having these source file references to click on in the VS Code terminal is a real time saver, especially in Hugo projects with mulitiple file roots (themes, theme components).
A list of the most important ""error improvements"":
A new server error template (can be overridden in layouts/_server/error.html), always add the content file context if relevant, improve JS errors, Add file context (with position) to codeblock render blocks, add file context to errors in the publishing step (e.g. minify), and more.  #9892 #9891 #9893
Fix SIGINT handling (allowing to kill the server) after loading bad configuration #9664
Improve SASS/SCSS errors (both Dart SASS and Libsass) #9897
Fix line numbers in errors from PostCSS, add missing file context to ""import not found"" #9895
Also worth mentioning is the new clock cli flag (#8787 ) which allows you to ""set the clock"" and see how your site looks like ... in the future.

36,"This release is mostly some important upgrades of Hugo's core dependencies, but we have also added crypto.FNV32a template function, which produces 32-bit unsigned integer hashes from a string. We have already many hash functions, but none of them produces an integer, which can be useful, e.g.:

This release also re-introduces the new server flag --renderStaticToDisk, which enables a  new hybrid static filesystem for Hugo's development server. This is great for sites with lots of static content, as it greatly reduces memory consumption while still keeping the fast render times by writing dynamic content to memory (the definition of static content in Hugo is all files mounted in /static and all files in /content that's not content files or a member of a content bundle). With this update, there are now 3 filesystem options when starting the server:

hugo server (default), renders to and serves all files from memory.
hugo server --renderToDisk, renders to and serves all files from disk.
hugo server --renderStaticToDisk (the new hybrid mode), renders to and serves static files from disk, dynamic files from memory.

One final improvement to mention would be the new key option in resources.GetRemote, which, is set, will be used as the cache key. The default behaviour is to calculate the key based on the URL and all the options. This means that you can now do:
{{ $cacheKey := print $url (now.Format ""2006-01-02"") }}
{{ $resource := resource.GetRemote $url (dict ""key"" $cacheKey) }}

41,"Vertical merging of content mounts. The main topic of this release is about file mounts (see #9693). We have had a powerful and well defined merge strategy for the union filesystems for the Hugo Modules tree on the horizontal axis (left to right), but not so much for the vertical configuration within each module (e.g. multiple content mounts for the same language). It was @jmooring who pointed out how useful this could be, and even provided this example where missing translations gets filled in from other language(s):
```toml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content mounts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EN content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'en'
DE content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/de'
target = 'content'
lang = 'de'
NL content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/nl'
target = 'content'
lang = 'nl'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fill in the missing translations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This fills in the gaps in DE content with EN content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'de'
This fills in the gaps in NL content with EN content.
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'nl'
```
Also, we have added some details to the .Err object you get when resources.GetRemote fails, which can be useful when debugging errrors (see #9708). Not you can do something like:
htmlbars
{{ with $result := resources.GetRemote $url }}
  {{ with .Err }}
    {{ warnf ""%s: %#v"" .Error .Data}}
  {{ else }}
    {{ with .Content | unmarshal }}
      {{ warnf ""%#v"" . }}
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
The .Data object above is a map and currently contains StatusCode, Status, Body, TransferEncoding, ContentLength, and ContentType.
This release represents 23 contributions by 8 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @jmooring, @dependabot[bot], and @anthonyfok for their ongoing contributions.
And thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his ongoing work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition.

42,"Even faster, continue and break support, short-circuit of the built-in and/or-operators. This release upgrades to Go 1.18 which was released yesterday. This has made Hugo even faster. How much faster will depend on your site etc., but we have benchmarks that show significant improvements. But the main reason we're exited about this is the improvements in Go templates:
There are two new keywords, break and continue. These behaves like you would expect coming from other programming languages:
htmlbars
{{ range $i, $p := site.RegularPages }}
  {{ if gt $i 2 }}
    {{/* Break out of range, we only want to print the first 3 pages. */}}
    {{ break }}
  {{ end }}
  {{ $p.Title }}
{{ end }}
htmlbars
{{ range $i, $p := site.RegularPages }}
  {{ if eq $i 2 }}
    {{/* Skip the 3rd page. */}}
    {{ continue }}
  {{ end }}
  {{ $p.Title }}
{{ end }}
Also, the two built-in operators/function and and or now short-circuits, also in line with how && and || behave in other programming languages. This is useful in situations where the right side may have side effects (may be nil, is slow to execute etc.):
htmlbars
{{ if and .File (eq .File.Extension ""html"") }}
{{ end }}

45,"Up to 20% reduction in build time and memory usage. That is the sales pitch for this release. In reality it depends (e.g. on how big and complex your site is), but we have benchmarks and real site tests that show impressive improvements. It was @quasilyte (see #9386) who tipped us about this potential. He had tested it with the digitalgov.gov website with about 20% speedup. 
Post Release Update: Hugo users are reporting tremendous speed boosts of more than 50%.
Continuing on the performance theme, @satotake has implemented a new hybrid static filesystem for Hugo's development server, which is great for sites with lots of static content, as it greatly reduces memory consumption while still keeping the fast render times by writing dynamic content to memory (the definition of static content in Hugo is all files mounted in /static and all files in /content that's not content files or a member of a content bundle). With this update, there are now 3 filesystem options when starting the server:

hugo server (default), renders to and serves all files from memory.
hugo server --renderToDisk, renders to and serves all files from disk.
hugo server --renderStaticToDisk (the new hybrid mode), renders to and serves static files from disk, dynamic files from memory.

A final note goes to the new linkifyProtocol option in the Goldmark Configuration (see #9639). The linkify extension is enabled by default. It turns www.example.org and similar into clickable links. But before this release, the default protocol used was http. This is in line with the CommonMark spec, but that doesn't make much sense in 2022, so now you get https as the default.
This release represents 38 contributions by 4 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @dependabot[bot], @jmooring, and @satotake for their ongoing contributions.

49,"Markdown diagrams and code block render hooks. Now it's possible create custom templates for Markdown code blocks, either for all or just for specific programming languages. This can also be used to render diagrams from Markdown code blocks. We provide GoAT (Go ASCII Tool) natively from Hugo, but you can also add your own template to get Mermaid support. The implementation of GoAT is a Go implementation by @blampe of markdeep.mini.js' diagrams. See the diagram documentation for details.
This means that you can write diagrams as text directly into diagrams, so this:
`goat

```

Also new in this release are:

The new CLI flag --printUnusedTemplates which prints templates not being invoked during the build.
The new method $image.Crop allows images to be cropped without being resized (thanks @johnsvenn for the implementation).

Notes

We have renamed some command line flags for consistency: --i18n-warnings to printI18nWarnings, --path-warnings, --print-men to --printPathWarnings, --printMemoryUsage.
Finally remove deprecated Page methods 9563c7d1 @bep #4117 

This release represents 107 contributions by 13 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @jmooring and @moorereason for their ongoing contributions. And thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his ongoing work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs,
which has received 7 contributions by 5 contributors. A special thanks to @jmooring, @LukeDeWaal, @andrewmjorda, and @chalin for their work on the documentation site.

52,"Hugo 0.92.0 is mostly a release to prepare for some cool stuff coming in the next releases. Most notable are the deprecation updates:

The .Page methods marked as deprecated in Hugo 0.55 are now removed. They have been logged as an ERROR for a long time now and you will still get a clear error if you use them.
The support for MMark as a Markdown engine is removed. That has been marked as deprecated for a long time, and the upstream library is also deprecated and unmaintained.
If you use .Path on a Page that is backed by a file, you will now get a warning. More on that below.

The .Path method on Page works like before. But that method currently has a little vague specification – it behaves a little different if backed by a file. In Hugo 0.93 we're going to introduce a canonical content path, and to prepare for that change, you may see this in your log:
```bash
WARN 2022/01/12 10:23:37 .Path when the page is backed by a file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We plan to use Path for a canonical source path and you probably want to check the source is a file. To get the current behaviour, you can use a construct simlar to the below:
{{ $path := """" }}
  {{ with .File }}
    {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ else }}
    {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ end }}
Re-run Hugo with the flag --panicOnWarning to get a better error message.
```
.Path is commonly used to create links to the source on GitHub – and that obviously only works for files, so you, as suggested above, may want to check if it's a file first.
Note that the --panicOnWarning flag is a new flag in this release and works for all warnings – it will fail fast on the first warning and point to the line in question. This makes it much easier to pin-point the location.
But this release isn't all about technical upgrades. We have also added a new hugo.Deps template function. We have already a way to list the Hugo Modules dependencies from the command line (hugo mod graph), but we thought it would be useful to also record this into your rendered site. An example of a ""dependency table"" in HTML may look like this:
```htmlbars
Dependencies



#
Owner
Path
Version
Time
Vendor



    {{ range $i, $e := hugo.Deps }}
    
{{ add $i 1 }}
{{ with .Owner }}{{.Path }}{{ end }}

        {{ .Path }}
        {{ with .Replace}}
        => {{ .Path }}
        {{ end }}
        
{{ .Version }}
{{ with .Time }}{{ . }}{{ end }}
{{ .Vendor }}

    {{ end }}
    

```

Notes
This release contains some changes that may break your build:
Use resources.GetRemote to fetch remote resources
In Hugo 0.90 we added remote support to resources.Get. In hindsight it was not a great idea use the same method for both, as a poll from many Hugo users showed. See Issue #9285 for more details. This release introduces resources.GetRemote which you need to use for remote resources. The example we showed in the release notes for 0.90.0 will now look like:
```htmlbars
{{ $font := resources.GetRemote ""https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/apache/roboto/static/Roboto-Black.ttf"" }}
{{ $img := resources.GetRemote ""https://gohugo.io/images/gohugoio-card-1.png"" }}
{{ $img = $img | images.Filter (images.Text 
                        ""Rocks!!!"" 
                        (dict 
                            ""color"" ""#E6B405"" 
                            ""size"" 100
                            ""lineSpacing"" 8 
                            ""x"" 400 ""y"" 320
                            ""font"" $font))
}}
```
If you want to fetch any resource not having to consider where it lives, you can use a construct similar to the below:
htmlbars
{{ resource := """" }}
{{ if (urls.Parse $url).IsAbs }}
  {{ $resource = resources.GetRemote $url }}
{{ else }}

New Security Configuration
This release also adds some new security hardening measures for the Hugo build runtime in the form of a new security configuration. There are some rarely used features in Hugo that would be good to have disabled by default. One example would be the ""external helpers"".
For asciidoctor and some others we use Go's os/exec package to start a new process. These are a predefined set of binary names, all loaded from PATH and with a predefined set of arguments. Still, if you don't use asciidoctor in your project, you might as well have it turned off.
You can configure this in the new security configuration section. The defaults are configured to create a minimal amount of site breakage, but if that do happen, you will get clear instructions in the console about what to do.
The default configuration is listed below. Note that almost all of these options are regular expression whitelists (a string or a slice); the value none will block all.
```toml
[security]
  enableInlineShortcodes = false
  [security.exec]
    allow = ['^dart-sass-embedded$', '^go$', '^npx$', '^postcss$']
    osEnv = ['(?i)^(PATH|PATHEXT|APPDATA|TMP|TEMP|TERM)$']
[security.funcs]
    getenv = ['^HUGO_']
[security.http]
    methods = ['(?i)GET|POST']
    urls = ['.*']
```

Notes
This release contains some changes that may break your build:
Use resources.GetRemote to fetch remote resources
In Hugo 0.90 we added remote support to resources.Get. In hindsight it was not a great idea use the same method for both, as a poll from many Hugo users showed. See Issue #9285 for more details. This release introduces resources.GetRemote which you need to use for remote resources. The example we showed in the release notes for 0.90.0 will now look like:
module
If you want to fetch any resource not having to consider where it lives, you can use a construct similar to the below:
htmlbars
{{ resource := """" }}
{{ if (urls.Parse $url).IsAbs }}
  {{ $resource = resources.GetRemote $url }}
{{ else }}
  {{ $resource = resources.Get $url }}
{{ end }}

56,"This release contains some fixes and improvements related to error handling in remote lookups in resources.Get, as introduced in Hugo 0.90.0:

Now we will always return nil (never fail the build) when a resource is not found, also for remote resources (HTTP status code 404). This means that you can do {{ with $img }}{{ else }}{{/* insert a default image or something */}}{{ end }} and similar constructs, not having to consider where the resource source lives.
Fetching resources remotely over HTTPS has a much greater chance of failing (network down, server down) than reading a file from disk (if not already cached). And having this lead to a failing build is not always optimal. This release allows you to handle/ignore these errors in the templates if needed, see details below.

The return value from resources.Get now includes an .Err method that will be set if the call failed. If you want to just log any error as a WARNING you can use a construct similar to the one below.
htmlbars
{{ with resources.Get ""https://gohugo.io/images/gohugoio-card-1.png"" }}
  {{ with .Err }}
    {{ warnf ""%s"" . }}
  {{ else }}
    <img src=""{{ .RelPermalink }}"" width=""{{ .Width }}"" height=""{{ .Height }}"" alt="""">
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
Note that if you do not handle .Err yourself, Hugo will fail the build the first time you start using the failed Resource object.

57,"Hugo 0.90 finally brings remote support to resources.Get, XML support (in /data and transform.Unmarshal), and a new images.Text filter. A special shoutout and thanks to @vanbroup for his work on these features.
The support for remote Resources in resources.Get has been a feature in great demand. This means that you can fetch remote files (images, JSON files, RSS feeds ...) and use them in Hugo Pipes functions as they were local. A contrived example may look like this:
```htmlbars
{{ $font := resources.Get ""https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/apache/roboto/static/Roboto-Black.ttf"" }}
{{ $img := resources.Get ""https://gohugo.io/images/gohugoio-card-1.png"" }}
{{ $img = $img | images.Filter (images.Text 
                        ""Rocks!"" 
                        (dict 
                            ""color"" ""#E6B405"" 
                            ""size"" 100
                            ""lineSpacing"" 8 
                            ""x"" 400 ""y"" 320
                            ""font"" $font))
}}

```
The above fetches both a font and an image remotely and then uses the new images.Text filter to overlay a text on top of the image.

62,"This release is a dependency refresh (the new Goldmark version comes with a lot of bug fixes, as one example), many bug fixes, but also some nice new features:
We have added the configuration settings includeFiles and excludeFiles to the mount configuration. This allows fine grained control over what files to include, and it works for all of Hugo's file systems (including /static).
We have also reimplemented archetypes. The old implementation had some issues, mostly related to the context (e.g. name, file paths) passed to the template. This new implementation is using the exact same code path for evaluating the pages as in a regular build. This also makes it more robust and easier to reason about in a multilingual setup. Now, if you are explicit about the target path, Hugo will now always pick the correct mount and language:
hugo new content/en/posts/my-first-post.md
This release represents 50 contributions by 13 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @dependabot[bot], @jmooring, and @anthonyfok for their ongoing contributions.
And thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his ongoing work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs,
which has received 23 contributions by 9 contributors. A special thanks to @jmooring, @bep, @coliff, and @vipkr for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

54999+ stars
430+ contributors
413+ themes

Notes

Hugo now writes an empty file named .hugo_build.lock to the root of the project when building (also when doing hugo new mypost.md and other commands that requires a build). We recommend you just leave this file alone. Put it in .gitignore or similar if you don't want the file in your source repository.
We have updated to ESBuild v0.13.12. The release notes for v0.13.0 mentions a potential breaking change.
We now only build AMD64 release binaries (see this issue) for the Unix OSes (e.g. NetBSD). If you need, say, a binary for ARM64, you need to build it yourself.
We now build only one release binary/archive for MacOS (see this issue) that works on both Intel and the new Arm M1 systems.
.File.ContentBaseName now returns the owning directory name for all bundles (branch an leaf). This is a bug fix, but worth mentioning. See this issue.
We have updated the Twitter shortcode to use Twitter's new API. See this issue for details.

Notes

We have fixed a bug with the import order in js.Build for the case ./foo when both ./foo.js and ./foo/index.js exists. This is in line with how both Node and ESBuild's native import resolver does it. We discovered this trying to build AlpineJS v3 from source mounted in /assets. See cf73cc2e @bep #8945.

65,"Hugo 0.87 brings two long sought-after features: Default time zone support (per language if needed) for dates without zone offset or location info, and localized time and dates and numbers (backed by CLDR).
For more information, see:

The time zone config documentation.

67,"This is release is a set of smaller fixes and improvements. Some of the more noteable:
You can now have a top level cascade (or one per language, if needed) section in your site configuration (e.g. config.toml). This way you can control default front matter values from outside of the content files.
Hugo's Menu system works good, but hasn't been particulary easy to set the active menu state for section pages without a menu defintion. We have had the option Section Menu for Lazy Bloggers. That helped for the common case, but we have now made it behave more sensible out of the box: $page.HasMenuCurrent $sectionMenuEntry will now always return true for any descendant of that section. To support this for menu defintions in the site config, we have added a new pageRef option on MenuEntry:
```toml
[[menus.main]]
pageRef = ""blog""
When pageRef is set, setting url is optional; it will be used as a fallback if the page is not found.
url = ""/blog""
```
Set pageRef to a value that site.GetPage understands, and the menu entry will be correctly connected to the page.

73,"This release brings several configuration fixes and improvements that will be especially useful for themes.
Deep merge of theme Params
One of the most common complaint from Hugo theme owners/users has been about the configuration handling. Hugo has up until now only performed a shallow merge of theme params into the configuration.
With that, given this example from a theme configuration:
toml
[params]
[params.colours]
blue=""#337DFF""
green=""#68FF33""
red=""#FF3358""
If you would like to use the above theme, but want a different shade of red, you earlier had to copy the entire block, even the colours you're totally happy with. This was painful even the simplest setup.
Now you can just override the params keys you want to change, e.g.:
toml
[params]
[params.colours]
red=""#fc0f03""
For more information, and especially about the way you can opt out of the above behaviour, see Merge Configuration from Themes.
Themes now support the config directory
Now both the project and themes/modules can store its configuration in both the top level config file (e.g. config.toml) or in the config directory. See Configuration Directory.
HTTP headers in getJSON/getCSV
getJSON now supports custom HTTP headers. This has been a big limitation in Hugo, especially considering the Authorization header.
We have updated the internal Instagram shortcode to pass the access token in a header:
{{ $hideCaption := cond (eq (.Get 1) ""hidecaption"") ""1"" ""0"" }}

New erroridf template func
Sometime, especially when creating themes, it is useful to be able to let the user decide if an error situation is critical enough to fail the build. The new erroridf produces ERROR log statements that can be toggled off:
html
{{ erroridf ""some-custom-id"" ""Some error message."" }}
Will log:
ERROR: Some error message.
If you feel that this should not be logged as an ERROR, you can ignore it by adding this to your site config:
ignoreErrors = [""some-custom-id""]
Stats
This release represents 46 contributions by 11 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @jmooring, @satotake, and @Seirdy for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs,
which has received 20 contributions by 10 contributors. A special thanks to @salim-b, @bep, @thomasjsn, and @lucasew for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

52487+ stars
432+ contributors
370+ themes

Notes

We now do deep merging of params from theme config(s). That is you most likely what you want, but Merge Configuration from Themes describes how you can get the old behaviour back.

","This release brings several configuration fixes and improvements that will be especially useful for themes.
Deep merge of theme Params
One of the most common complaint from Hugo theme owners/users has been about the configuration handling. Hugo has up until now only performed a shallow merge of theme params into the configuration.
With that, given this example from a theme configuration:
toml
[params]
[params.colours]
blue=""#337DFF""
green=""#68FF33""
red=""#FF3358""
If you would like to use the above theme, but want a different shade of red, you earlier had to copy the entire block, even the colours you're totally happy with. This was painful even the simplest setup.
Now you can just override the params keys you want to change, e.g.:
toml
[params]
[params.colours]
red=""#fc0f03""
For more information, and especially about the way you can opt out of the above behaviour, see Merge Configuration from Themes.
Themes now support the config directory
Now both the project and themes/modules can store its configuration in both the top level config file (e.g. config.toml) or in the config directory. See Configuration Directory.
HTTP headers in getJSON/getCSV
getJSON now supports custom HTTP headers. This has been a big limitation in Hugo, especially considering the Authorization header.
We have updated the internal Instagram shortcode to pass the access token in a header:
{{ $hideCaption := cond (eq (.Get 1) ""hidecaption"") ""1"" ""0"" }}
{{ $headers := dict ""Authorization"" (printf ""Bearer %s"" $accessToken) }}
{{ with getJSON ""link/"" $id ""/&hidecaption="" $hideCaption $headers }}
    {{ .html | safeHTML }}
{{ end }}
Also see the discussion this issue about the access token above.
New erroridf template func
Sometime, especially when creating themes, it is useful to be able to let the user decide if an error situation is critical enough to fail the build. The new erroridf produces ERROR log statements that can be toggled off:
html
{{ erroridf ""some-custom-id"" ""Some error message."" }}
Will log:
ERROR: Some error message.

ignoreErrors = [""some-custom-id""]

78,"Hugo 0.81.0 is the first release in this decade, it is the fastest to date, and it's packed with useful new features.
Newlines in Template Actions and Commands
You can now have newlines within template actions and pipelines. This means that you can now do this and similar:
go-html-template
{{ dict 
    ""country"" ""Norway"" 
    ""population"" ""5 millions""
    ""language"" ""Norwegian""
    ""language_code"" ""nb""
    ""weather"" ""freezing cold""
    ""capitol"" ""Oslo""
    ""largest_city"" ""Oslo""
    ""currency""  ""Norwegian krone""
    ""dialing_code"" ""+47"" 
}}
Note that the above construction will fail in Hugo versions < 0.81.0.
Attribute Lists after Markdown Blocks
Hugo already supports adding attribute lists (e.g CSS classes) after titles. We now also allow adding attribute lists after Markdown blocks, e.g. tables, lists, paragraphs etc.:
```

foo
bar
{.myclass}
```

See Configure Goldmark.
Performance
This release is the fastest Hugo to date, see details in the benchmarks below. This is especially true if you use the new ARM64 MacOS binary (only works on Apple M1 devices).

And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour, @coliff and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 20 contributions by 13 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @gagarine, @fridde, and @NicoHood for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

50152+ stars
435+ contributors
370+ themes

Notes

We have updated to Beta 6 of the Dart Sass Protocol which is not backwards compatible, so if you use Dart Sass you need to also update that binary.
hugo gen autocomplete now default to stdout; you can change this by setting --completionfile. As an added bonus we now also support auto completion for zsh, fish and powershell.

","Hugo 0.81.0 is the first release in this decade, it is the fastest to date, and it's packed with useful new features.
Newlines in Template Actions and Commands
You can now have newlines within template actions and pipelines. This means that you can now do this and similar:
go-html-template
{{ dict 
    ""country"" ""Norway"" 
    ""population"" ""5 millions""
    ""language"" ""Norwegian""
    ""language_code"" ""nb""
    ""weather"" ""freezing cold""
    ""capitol"" ""Oslo""
    ""largest_city"" ""Oslo""
    ""currency""  ""Norwegian krone""
    ""dialing_code"" ""+47"" 
}}
Note that the above construction will fail in Hugo versions < 0.81.0.
Attribute Lists after Markdown Blocks
Hugo already supports adding attribute lists (e.g CSS classes) after titles. We now also allow adding attribute lists after Markdown blocks, e.g. tables, lists, paragraphs etc.:
```
foo
bar
{.myclass}
```
See Configure Goldmark.
Performance
This release is the fastest Hugo to date, see details in the benchmarks below. This is especially true if you use the new ARM64 MacOS binary (only works on Apple M1 devices).

Native Arm Binary for Apple M1
We finally provide native Hugo binary for Apple M1 devices. Download the file named hugo_0.81.0_macOS-ARM64.tar.gz.
JavaScript Building
Add inject config option allowing you to automatically replace a global variable with an import from another file relative to assets. 32b86076 @bep #8164
Add shims config option to swap out a component with another. A common use case is to load dependencies like React from a CDN  (with shims) when in production, but running with the full bundled node_modules dependency during development e19a046c @bep #8165
Add external source map support to js.Build and Babel 2c8b5d91 @richtera #8132
Fix nilpointer in js.Build error handling a1fe552f @bep #8162
Also see js.Build Options.
Hugo Modules
There are several Hugo Modules-related improvements in this release:
Allow absolute paths for any modules resolved via project replacement 3a5ee0d2 @bep #8240
Add config option modules.vendorClosest bdfbcf6f @bep #8235#8242
Throw an error running hugo mod vendor on mountless module 4ffaeaf1 @bep 
Statistics
This release represents 59 contributions by 14 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @moorereason and @benmezger for their ongoing contributions. And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour, @coliff and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 20 contributions by 13 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @gagarine, @fridde, and @NicoHood for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:
50152+ stars
435+ contributors
370+ themes
Notes
We have updated to Beta 6 of the Dart Sass Protocol which is not backwards compatible, so if you use Dart Sass you need to also update that binary.
hugo gen autocomplete now default to stdout; you can change this by setting --completionfile. As an added bonus we now also support auto completion for zsh, fish and powershell.

80,"Hugo depends on Go's os/exec for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system %PATH% on Windows. However, if a malicious file with the same name (exe or bat) was found in the current working directory at the time of running hugo, the malicious command would be invoked instead of the system one.
Windows users who ran hugo inside untrusted Hugo sites was affected.
The origin of this issue comes from Go, see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736
We have fixed this in Hugo by using a patched version of exec.LookPath from https://github.com/cli/safeexec (thanks to @mislav for the implementation).

84,"This release finally brings full Hugo Modules support to js.Build, curtsy of the new plugin API in the really, really fast ESBuild by @evanw.
Some notes on the improvements in this release:

Now js.Build fully supports the virtual union file system in Hugo Modules. Any import inside your JavaScript components will resolve starting from the top component mount inside /assets with a fallback to the traditional ""JS way"" (node_modules etc.)
You can now pass configuration data from the templates to your scripts via a new params option.
Hugo now writes a jsconfig.js file inside /assets (you can turn it off) with import mappings to help editors such as VS Code with intellisense/navigation, which is especially useful when there is no common root and the source lives inside some temporary directory.
We have also improved the build errors you get from js.Build. In server mode you will get a preview of the failing lines and in the console you will get a link to the location.

Read more about this in the documentation, but a short usage example would look like:
In the template:
go-html-template
{{ $js := resources.Get ""js/main.js"" | js.Build (dict ""params"" (dict ""api"" ""https://example.org/api"" ) }}
And then in a JavaScript component:
```js
import * as params from '@params';
// Wil resolve to one of hello.{js,ts,tsx,jsx} inside assets/my/module.
import { hello } from 'my/module/hello';
var api = params.api;
hello();
```

You can now build with mage install -tags nodeploy if you don't need the hugo deploy feature.
Remote getJSON errors can now be ignored by adding ignoreErrors = [""error-remote-getjson""] to your site config.

There are also several useful Hugo Modules enhancements:

We have added Replacements to the Module Configuration. This should enable a much simpler developer workflow, simpler to set up preview sites for your remote theme etc, as you now can do env HUGO_MODULE_REPLACEMENTS=""github.com/bep/myprettytheme -> ../.."" hugo and similar.

93,"Hugo 0.75.0 brings several improvements to Hugo Modules, a new CLI command to bridge the JavaScript dependencies into Hugo, a refresh of the versions of the most important upstream dependencies, and more.
NPM Pack
The new CLI command is called hugo mod npm pack.  We have marked it as experimental. It works great, go ahead and use it, but we need to test this out in real projects to get a feel of it; it is likely that it will change/improve in the upcoming versions of Hugo. The command creates a consolidated package.json from the project and all of its theme components. On version conflicts, the version closest to the project is selected. We may revise that strategy in the future (minimal version selection maybe?), but this should give both control and the least amount of surprise for the site owner.
So, why did we do this? JavaScript is often a background actor in a Hugo project, and it doesn't make sense to publish it to a NPM registry. The JS dependencies are mostly build tools (PostCSS, TailwindCSS, Babel), devDependencies. This has been working fine as long as you kept the JS config files (including package.json) in the project, adding duplication/work when using ready-to-use theme components. These tools work best when you have everything below a single file tree, which is very much different to how Hugo Modules work. An example of a module with TailwindCSS:
bash
tailwind-module
├── assets
│   └── css
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
└── tailwind.config.js
If you included tailwind-module in a Hugo project and processed it with PostCSS, this is what happened in earlier versions:

It used the directory where the postcss.config.js lives as a starting point to look  for any require'd dependency.
TailwindCSS would, on the other hand, load its configuration file relative to where PostCSS was invoked (the project directory).

The above just doesn't work and here is the technical notes on how we have fixed this:

The new hugo mod npm pack creates a consolidated package.json based on files named package.hugo.json it finds in the dependency tree (one is created for you the first time you run this command). The end result will always be package.json, which works seamlessly with npm install invoked automatically by Netlify and other CI vendors.
The main project's node_modules folder is added to NODE_PATH when running PostCSSand Babel.
We have introduced a new mount point assets/_jsconfig where we, by default, mount the JS configuration files that we're interested in. This is where Hugo will start looking for these files, and the files' filenames will also be available in the Node environment, so you can do:

js
let tailwindConfig = process.env.HUGO_FILE_TAILWIND_CONFIG_JS || './tailwind.config.js';
const tailwind = require('tailwindcss')(tailwindConfig);
Module Enhancements

We have added a noVendor Glob pattern config to the module config d4611c43 @bep #7647. This allows you to only vendor a subset of your dependencies.
We have added ignoreImports option to module imports config 20af9a07 @bep #7646, which allows you to import a module and load its config, but not follow its imports.
We have deprecated --ignoreVendor in favour of a --ignoreVendor, a patch matching Glob pattern 9a1e6d15 @bep. A typical use for this would be when you have vendored your dependencies, but want to edit one of them.

Statistics
This release represents 79 contributions by 19 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @dependabot[bot], @moorereason, and @jmooring for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour, @coliff and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 24 contributions by 15 contributors. A special thanks to @jmooring, @bep, @jornane, and @inwardmovement for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

Notes

We now build with Go 1.15, which means that we no longer build release binaries for MacOS 32-bit.
You may now get an error message about ""error calling partial: partials that returns a value needs a non-zero argument."". This error situation was not caught earlier, and comes from a limitation in Go's templates: If you use the return keyword in a partial, the argument you pass to that partial (e.g. the ""."") cannot be zero (and 0 and """" is considered a zero argument).

","Hugo 0.75.0 brings several improvements to Hugo Modules, a new CLI command to bridge the JavaScript dependencies into Hugo, a refresh of the versions of the most important upstream dependencies, and more.
NPM Pack
The new CLI command is called hugo mod npm pack.  We have marked it as experimental. It works great, go ahead and use it, but we need to test this out in real projects to get a feel of it; it is likely that it will change/improve in the upcoming versions of Hugo. The command creates a consolidated package.json from the project and all of its theme components. On version conflicts, the version closest to the project is selected. We may revise that strategy in the future (minimal version selection maybe?), but this should give both control and the least amount of surprise for the site owner.
So, why did we do this? JavaScript is often a background actor in a Hugo project, and it doesn't make sense to publish it to a NPM registry. The JS dependencies are mostly build tools (PostCSS, TailwindCSS, Babel), devDependencies. This has been working fine as long as you kept the JS config files (including package.json) in the project, adding duplication/work when using ready-to-use theme components. These tools work best when you have everything below a single file tree, which is very much different to how Hugo Modules work. An example of a module with TailwindCSS:
bash
tailwind-module
├── assets
│   └── css
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
└── tailwind.config.js
If you included tailwind-module in a Hugo project and processed it with PostCSS, this is what happened in earlier versions:
It used the directory where the postcss.config.js lives as a starting point to look  for any require'd dependency.
TailwindCSS would, on the other hand, load its configuration file relative to where PostCSS was invoked (the project directory).
The above just doesn't work and here is the technical notes on how we have fixed this:
The new hugo mod npm pack creates a consolidated package.json based on files named package.hugo.json it finds in the dependency tree (one is created for you the first time you run this command). The end result will always be package.json, which works seamlessly with npm install invoked automatically by Netlify and other CI vendors.
The main project's node_modules folder is added to NODE_PATH when running PostCSSand Babel.
We have introduced a new mount point assets/_jsconfig where we, by default, mount the JS configuration files that we're interested in. This is where Hugo will start looking for these files, and the files' filenames will also be available in the Node environment, so you can do:
js
let tailwindConfig = process.env.HUGO_FILE_TAILWIND_CONFIG_JS || './tailwind.config.js';
const tailwind = require('tailwindcss')(tailwindConfig);
Module Enhancements
We have added a noVendor Glob pattern config to the module config d4611c43 @bep #7647. This allows you to only vendor a subset of your dependencies.
We have added ignoreImports option to module imports config 20af9a07 @bep #7646, which allows you to import a module and load its config, but not follow its imports.
We have deprecated --ignoreVendor in favour of a --ignoreVendor, a patch matching Glob pattern 9a1e6d15 @bep. A typical use for this would be when you have vendored your dependencies, but want to edit one of them.
Statistics
This release represents 79 contributions by 19 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @dependabot[bot], @moorereason, and @jmooring for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour, @coliff and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 24 contributions by 15 contributors. A special thanks to @jmooring, @bep, @jornane, and @inwardmovement for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:
46596+ stars
438+ contributors
352+ themes
Notes
We now build with Go 1.15, which means that we no longer build release binaries for MacOS 32-bit.
You may now get an error message about ""error calling partial: partials that returns a value needs a non-zero argument."". This error situation was not caught earlier, and comes from a limitation in Go's templates: If you use the return keyword in a partial, the argument you pass to that partial (e.g. the ""."") cannot be zero (and 0 and """" is considered a zero argument).

97,"Note: The documentation site isn't updated with all of the main new things below. We will get to it soon.
This release comes with native JavaScript bundling (and minifier), with import support (from node_modules etc.), tree shaking, scope hoisting for ES6 modules, transpilation of JSX and newer JS syntax down to ES6, JavaScript/JSX and TypeScript/TSX support. And it's very fast. Benchmarks rates it at least 100x faster than the other JavaScript bundlers included. This new feature is backed by the very impressive ESBuild project by @evanw. Many thanks to @remko for the integration work.
A very simple example building a TypeScript file:
go-html-template
{{ $js := resources.Get ""js/main.ts"" | js.Build }}
This release also comes with Open API 3-support. This makes it much easier to create ""Swagger styled"" API-documentation. The below will unmarshal your YAML file into this object graph:
go-html-template
{{ $api := resources.Get ""api/openapi.yaml"" | openapi3.Unmarshal }}
Hugo's Asciidoc integration has also gotten a face lift. A big shoutout to @muenchhausen and @bwklein for their work on this.
And finally, partials can now be defined inline -- and that is way more useful than it sounds.

105,"It's Easter, a time for mysteries and puzzles. And at first glance, this Hugo release looks a little mysterious. The core of it is a mind-twister:
go-html-template
{{ $css := resources.Get ""css/main.css"" }}
{{ $css = $css | resources.PostCSS }}
{{ if hugo.IsProduction }}
{{ $css = $css | minify | fingerprint | resources.PostProcess }}
{{ end }}
<link href=""{{ $css.RelPermalink }}"" rel=""stylesheet"" />
The above uses the new resources.PostProcess template function which tells Hugo to postpone the transformation of the Hugo Pipes chain to after the build, allowing the build steps to use the build output in /public as part of its processing.
The prime current use case for the above is CSS pruning in PostCSS. In simple cases you can use the templates as a base for the content filters, but that has its limitations and can be very hard to setup, especially in themed configurations. So we have added a new writeStats configuration that, when enabled, will write a file named hugo_stats.json to your project root with some aggregated data about the build, e.g. list of HTML entities published, to be used to do CSS pruning.

Release Highlights
New in Hugo Core
Any branch node can now bundle resources (images, data files etc.), even the taxonomy nodes (e.g. /categories).
List pages (sections and the home page) can now be added to taxonomies.
The front matter fields that control when and if to publish a piece of content (draft, publishDate, expiryDate) now also works for list pages, and is recursive.
We have added a new _build front matter keyword to provide fine-grained control over page publishing. The default values:
yaml
_build:
  # Whether to add it to any of the page collections.
  # Note that the page can still be found with .Site.GetPage.
  list: true
  
  # Whether to render it.
  render: true
  
  # Whether to publish its resources. These will still be published on demand,
  # but enabling this can be useful if the originals (e.g. images) are
  # never used.
  publishResources: true
Note that all front matter keywords can be set in the cascade on a branch node, which would be especially useful for _build.
We have also upgraded to the latest LibSass (v3.6.3). Nothing remarkable functional new here, but it makes Hugo ready for the upcoming Dart Backport.
And finally, we have added a GetTerms method on Page, making  listing the terms defined on this page in the given taxonomy much simpler:
```go-html-template

    {{ range (.GetTerms ""tags"") }}
        {{ .LinkTitle }}
   {{ end }}

```
New in Hugo Modules
There are several improvements to the tooling used in Hugo Modules. One bug fix, but also some improvements to make it easier to manage:

You can now recursively update your modules with hugo mod get -u ./...
hugo mod clean will now only clean the cache for the current project and now also takes an optional module path pattern, e.g. hugo mod clean --pattern ""github.com/**""
A new command hugo mod verify is added to verify that the module cache matches the hashes in go.sum. Run with hugo mod verify --clean to delete any modules that fail this check.

See hugo mod.
Performance
The new features listed above required a structural simplification, and we do watch our weight when doing this. And the benchmarks show that Hugo should, in general, be slightly faster. This is especially true if you're using taxonomies, and the partial rebuilding on content changes should be considerably faster.
Numbers
This release represents 34 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @satotake, @QuLogic, and @JaymoKang for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 7 contributions by 4 contributors. A special thanks to @coliff, @bep, @tibnew, and @nerg4l for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

41724+ stars
439+ contributors
299+ themes

Notes

.GetPage ""members.md"" (the Page method) will now only do relative lookups, which is what most people would expect.
There have been a slight change of how disableKinds for regular pages: They will not be rendered on its own, but will be added to the site collections.

Not that we are particularly concerned about Hugo's build speed. We leave that to others. But we would hate if it got slower, so we have a comprehensive benchmark suite.

And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @davidsneighbour and @kaushalmodi for all the great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 13 contributions by 10 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @jeffscottlevine, @davidsneighbour, and @nicfits for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

Notes

.Type on-page now returns an empty string if not set in the front matter or if .Section returns empty. See #6760.
Baseof template (e.g. baseof.html) lookup order is completely revised/expanded. See base template lookup order. We now do template resolution at execution time following the same rules as the template it applies to (e.g. _default/single.html). This is an obvious improvement and your site should work as before.
Shortcode params now supports params with raw string literals (strings surrounded with ``) that supports newlines.
Note: In a base template (e.g. baseof.html), the first template block must be a define.

122,"The main driving force behind these patch releases in the new year has been getting a good story with portable links between GitHub and Hugo, using the new render hooks introduced in Hugo 0.62.0. And all was mostly well until a Hugo user asked about anchor links. Which is, when you look into it, a slightly sad Markdown story. They have been talking about anchors in Markdown over at the CommonMark forum for the last six years, but it has come to nothing. The current situation is that some Markdown engines support the {#anchorName} attribute syntax (Hugo's Goldmark does, GitHub does not) and for those that support auto-generation of IDs, the implementation often varies. And this makes for poor portability.
To improve this, Hugo has now reverse-engineered GitHub's implementation and made that the default strategy for generation or header IDs. We understand that this isn't everyone's cup of tea, so you can configure the behaviour to be one of github, github-ascii (some client-libraries have Unicode issues) or blackfriday (which will match how it behaved before Hugo 0.60).

124,"From all of us to all of you, a very Merry Christmas -- and Hugo 0.62.0! This version brings Markdown Render Hooks. This gives you full control over how links and images in Markdown are rendered without using any shortcodes. With this, you can get Markdown links that work on both GitHub and Hugo, resize images etc. It is a very long sought after feature, that has been hard to tackle until we got Goldmark, the new Markdown engine, by @yuin. When you read up on this new feature in the documentation, also note the new .RenderString method on Page.
Adding these render hooks also had the nice side effect of making Hugo faster and more memory effective. We could have just added this feature on top of what we got, getting it to work. But you like Hugo's fast builds, you love instant browser-refreshes on change. So we had to take a step back and redesign how we detect ""what changed?"" for templates referenced from content files, either directly or indirectly. And by doing that we greatly simplified how we handle all the templates. Which accidentally makes this version  the fastest to date. It's not an ""every site will be much faster"" statement. This depends. Sites with many languages and/or many templates will benefit more from this. We have benchmarks with site-building showing about 15% improvement in build speed and memory efficiency.

Notes

Ace and Amber support is now removed from Hugo. See #6609 for more information.
The markdownify template function does not, yet, support render hooks. We recommend you look at the new and more powerful .RenderString method on Page.
If you have output format specific behaviour in a template used from a content file, you must create a output format specific template, e.g. myshortcode.amp.html. This also applies to the new rendering hooks introduced in this release. This has been the intended behaviour all the time, but a failing test (now fixed) shows that the implementation of this has not been as strict as specified, hence this note.
The errorf does not return any value anymore. This means that the ERROR will just be printed to the console. We have also added a warnf template func.

Notes
Ace and Amber support is now removed from Hugo. See #6609 for more information.
The markdownify template function does not, yet, support render hooks. We recommend you look at the new and more powerful .RenderString method on Page.
If you have output format specific behaviour in a template used from a content file, you must create a output format specific template, e.g. myshortcode.amp.html. This also applies to the new rendering hooks introduced in this release. This has been the intended behaviour all the time, but a failing test (now fixed) shows that the implementation of this has not been as strict as specified, hence this note.
The errorf does not return any value anymore. This means that the ERROR will just be printed to the console. We have also added a warnf template func.

127,"Goldmark by @yuin is now the new default library used for Markdown in Hugo. It's CommonMark compliant and  GitHub flavored, and both fast and flexible. Blackfriday, the old default, has served us well, but there have been formatting and portability issues that were hard to work around. The ""CommonMark compliant"" part is the main selling feature of Goldmark, but with that you also get attribute syntax on headers and code blocks (for code blocks you can turn on/off line numbers and highlight line ranges), strikethrough support and an improved and configurable implementation of TableOfContents. See Markup Configuration for an overview of extensions.
Please read the Notes Section and the updated documentation. We suggest you start with List of content formats in Hugo. Goldmark is better, but the feature set is not fully comparable and it may be more stricter in some areas (there are 17 rules for how a headline should look like); if you have any problems you cannot work around, see Configure Markup for a way to change the default Markdown handler.
Also, if you have lots of inline HTML in your Markdown files, you may have to enable the unsafe mode:
yaml

  goldmark:
    renderer:
      unsafe: true

Config option for code highlighting of code fences in Markdown is now default on. This is what most people wants.
There are some differences in the feature set of Goldmark and Blackfriday. See the documentation for details.
The highlight shortcode/template func and the code fence attributes now share the same API regarding line numbers and highlight ranges.
The Total in ... for the hugo command now includes the configuration and modules loading, which should make it more honest/accurate.
The image logic in the 3 SEO internal templates twitter_cards.html,  opengraph.html, and schema.html is consolidated: images page param first, then bundled image matching *feature*, *cover* or *thumbnail*, then finally images site param.

129,"The timing of this release is motivated by getting the copies of the docs repositories in synch, now fully ""Hugo Modularized"". But it also comes with some very nice additions:
It is now possible to set the target format and the background fill color when processing images, e.g.:
{{ $image.Resize ""600x jpg #b31280"" }}
See Image Processing Options.
Another useful addon is the $pages.Next and $pages.Prev methods on the core page collections in Hugo. These works the same way as the built-in static variants one Page, e.g. .Next and .NextInSection:
{{with .Site.RegularPages.Next . }}{{.RelPermalink}}{{end}}
The above is a functionally equivalent (but slightly slower) variant of:
{{with .Next }}{{.RelPermalink}}{{end}}
See Pages Methods for more information.

Notes

Shortcode params can now be typed (supported types are string, bool int and float64, see #6376.
Pages.Next/.Prev as described above has existed for a long time, but they have been undocumented. They have been reimplemented for this release and now works like their namesakes on Page. This may be considered a breaking change, but it should be a welcome one, as the old behaviour wasn't very useful. See #4500

","The timing of this release is motivated by getting the copies of the docs repositories in synch, now fully ""Hugo Modularized"". But it also comes with some very nice additions:
It is now possible to set the target format and the background fill color when processing images, e.g.:
{{ $image.Resize ""600x jpg #b31280"" }}
See Image Processing Options.
Another useful addon is the $pages.Next and $pages.Prev methods on the core page collections in Hugo. These works the same way as the built-in static variants one Page, e.g. .Next and .NextInSection:
{{with .Site.RegularPages.Next . }}{{.RelPermalink}}{{end}}
The above is a functionally equivalent (but slightly slower) variant of:
{{with .Next }}{{.RelPermalink}}{{end}}
See Pages Methods for more information.
This release represents 45 contributions by 13 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @anthonyfok, @BaibhaVatsa, and @XhmikosR for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 34 contributions by 20 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @celtic-coder, @napcs, and @bmackinney for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:
38843+ stars
441+ contributors
255+ themes
Notes
Shortcode params can now be typed (supported types are string, bool int and float64, see #6376.
Pages.Next/.Prev as described above has existed for a long time, but they have been undocumented. They have been reimplemented for this release and now works like their namesakes on Page. This may be considered a breaking change, but it should be a welcome one, as the old behaviour wasn't very useful. See #4500

133,"Hugo 0.58 adds the long sought after Exif (docs)  method on image and a bunch of useful image filters (docs), courtesy of @disintegration's great Gift image library.
This means that you now can do variations of this:

{{ $blurryGrayscale := $myimage.Resize ""300x200"" | images.Filter images.Grayscale (images.GaussianBlur 8) }}
{{ $exif := $myimg.Exif }}
It's worth noting that the issue that enabled/triggered the implementation of the above was the simplifications needed to fix #5903, which makes sure that type information is preserved when processed via Hugo Pipes. E.g. you can now do:
go-html-template
{{ ($myimg | fingerprint ).Width }}
And it works as expected.

317+ themes

Notes

home.Pages now behaves like all the other sections, see #6240. If you want to list all the regular pages, use .Site.RegularPages.
We have added some new image filters to Hugo's image processing. This also means that we have consolidated the resize operations to use the one gift library (from the same developer as the one we used before). The operations work as before, but one difference is that we no longer embed ey color profile information in PNG images, but this should also be a more portable solution. Software that supports color profiles will assume that images without an embedded profile are in the sRGB profile. Software that doesn't support color profiles will use the monitor's profile, which is most likely to be sRGB as well.
We have improved the file cache logic for processed images and only stores them once when the same image is bundled in multiple languages. This means that you may want to run hugo --gc to clean your image cache.

136,"Hugo 0.57 brings Cascading Front Matter, Alphabetical Sorting, Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards. And more.
Cascading Front Matter: We have added a new and powerful cascade keyword to Hugo's front matter. This can be added to any index node in _index.md. Any values in cascade will be merged into itself and all the descendants.
yaml
title: ""My Blog""
icon: ""world.png""
cascade:
   icon: ""flag.png""
   outputs: [""HTML""]
   type: ""blog""
It's worth noting that the cascade element itself will also be merged. Also, to grasp the full value of this feature, remember that front matter in Hugo is both data and behaviour: You can tell Hugo how to process a subset of the pages (some example keywords are layout, type, outputs, weight) using the cascade keyword, e.g. ""I want this subsection to be rendered in both the HTML and Calendar Output Formats"".
This feature is created by@regisphilibert and @bep See #6041 for details.
Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards: We have added two new sought after template functions to the resources namespace: resources.Match and resources.GetMatch. These behaves like their namesake methods on Page (with super-asterisk wildcard support), but searches in all the resources in Assets. E.g. {{ $prettyImages := resources.Match ""images/**pretty.jpg"" }} will give a slice of all ""pretty pictures"". Another relevant example: {{ $js := resources.Match ""libs/*.js"" | resources.Concat ""js/bundle.js"" }}.
Performance: In general, this version is slightly faster and more memory effective. In particular, we have fixed a performance issue with the replacer step that greatly improves the build speed of certain large and content-rich sites (thanks to @vazrupe for the fix).  
This release represents 46 contributions by 8 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @muesli, @XhmikosR, and @vazrupe for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 13 contributions by 7 contributors. A special thanks to @regisphilibert, @bep, @kenberkeley, and @davidsneighbour for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:

37336+ stars
440+ contributors
334+ themes

Notes

All string sorting in Hugo is now alphabetical/lexicographical.
home.Pages now only returns pages in the top level section. Before this release, it included all regular pages in the site. This made it easy to list all the pages on home page, but it also meant that you needed to take special care if you wanted to navigate the page tree from top to bottom. If you need all regular pages, use .Site.RegularPages.  Also see #6153.
.Pages now include sections. We have added .RegularPages as a convenience method if you want the old behaviour. See #6154 for details.
Hugo now only ""auto create"" sections for the home page and the top level folders. The other sections need a _index.md file. See #6171 for details.

","Hugo 0.57 brings Cascading Front Matter, Alphabetical Sorting, Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards. And more.
Cascading Front Matter: We have added a new and powerful cascade keyword to Hugo's front matter. This can be added to any index node in _index.md. Any values in cascade will be merged into itself and all the descendants.
yaml
title: ""My Blog""
icon: ""world.png""
cascade:
   icon: ""flag.png""
   outputs: [""HTML""]
   type: ""blog""
It's worth noting that the cascade element itself will also be merged. Also, to grasp the full value of this feature, remember that front matter in Hugo is both data and behaviour: You can tell Hugo how to process a subset of the pages (some example keywords are layout, type, outputs, weight) using the cascade keyword, e.g. ""I want this subsection to be rendered in both the HTML and Calendar Output Formats"".
This feature is created by@regisphilibert and @bep See #6041 for details.
Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards: We have added two new sought after template functions to the resources namespace: resources.Match and resources.GetMatch. These behaves like their namesake methods on Page (with super-asterisk wildcard support), but searches in all the resources in Assets. E.g. {{ $prettyImages := resources.Match ""images/*pretty.jpg"" }} will give a slice of all ""pretty pictures"". Another relevant example: {{ $js := resources.Match ""libs/.js"" | resources.Concat ""js/bundle.js"" }}.
Performance: In general, this version is slightly faster and more memory effective. In particular, we have fixed a performance issue with the replacer step that greatly improves the build speed of certain large and content-rich sites (thanks to @vazrupe for the fix).
This release represents 46 contributions by 8 contributors to the main Hugo code base.@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @muesli, @XhmikosR, and @vazrupe for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 13 contributions by 7 contributors. A special thanks to @regisphilibert, @bep, @kenberkeley, and @davidsneighbour for their work on the documentation site.
Hugo now has:
37336+ stars
440+ contributors
334+ themes
Notes
All string sorting in Hugo is now alphabetical/lexicographical.
home.Pages now only returns pages in the top level section. Before this release, it included all regular pages in the site. This made it easy to list all the pages on home page, but it also meant that you needed to take special care if you wanted to navigate the page tree from top to bottom. If you need all regular pages, use .Site.RegularPages.  Also see #6153.
.Pages now include sections. We have added .RegularPages as a convenience method if you want the old behaviour. See #6154 for details.
Hugo now only ""auto create"" sections for the home page and the top level folders. The other sections need a _index.md file. See #6171 for details.

137,"This is a bug-fix release with a couple of important fixes. After getting feedback about the new Hugo Modules feature, this release also adds some minor improvements:
It adds support for overlapping file mounts, even for the filesystems where we walk down the directory structure. One relevant example that is fixed by this release:
toml
[module]
[[module.mounts]]
source=""content1""
target=""content""
[[module.mounts]]
source=""content2""
target=""content/docs""
The above is obviously both common and very useful. This was never an issue with the situations where load a specific file/directory (e.g. resources.Get ""a/b/c/d/sunset.jpg"").
User feedback also told us that these file mounts were a little hard to debug, so we added a new command that prints the configured mounts as a JSON:

Hugo Deploy is implemented by @vangent and brings built-in deployment support for GCS, S3, or Azure using the Hugo CLI. See the Hugo Deploy Documentation for more information.
Hugo Modules is very much a community effort on the design and specification side, but @bep has driven the implementation. Some notes about what all of this is about:

A new module configuration section where you can import almost anything. You can configure both your own file mounts and the file mounts of the modules you import. This is the new recommended way of configuring what you earlier put in configDir, staticDir etc. And it also allows you to mount folders in non-Hugo-projects, e.g. the SCSS folder in the Bootstrap GitHub project.
A module consists of a set of mounts to the standard 7 component types in Hugo: static, content, layouts, data, assets, i18n, and archetypes. Yes, Theme Components can now include content, which should be very useful, especially in bigger multilingual projects.
Modules not in your local file cache will be downloaded automatically and even ""hot replaced"" while the server is running.
Hugo Modules supports and encourages semver versioned modules, and uses the minimal version selection algorithm to resolve versions.
A new set of CLI commands are provided to manage all of this: hugo mod init,  hugo mod get,  hugo mod graph,  hugo mod tidy, and  hugo mod vendor.

Hugo Modules is powered by Go Modules.
This is all very much brand new and there are only a few example projects around:

https://github.com/bep/docuapi is a theme that has been ported to Hugo Modules while testing this feature. It is a good example of a non-Hugo-project mounted into Hugo's folder structure. It even shows a JS Bundler implementation in regular Go templates.
https://github.com/bep/my-modular-site is a very simple site used for testing.

See the Hugo Modules Documentation for more information.
This release represents 104 contributions by 19 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @vangent, @niklasfasching, and @coliff for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.

Hugo now has:

36902+ stars
440+ contributors
328+ themes

Notes

We  have removed the ""auto theme namespacing"" of  params from theme configuration. This was an undocumented and hidden feature that wasn't useful in practice.

We have revised and improved the symlinks support in Hugo: In earlier versions, symlinks were only fully supported for the content folders. With the introduction of the new very flexible file mounts, with content support even for what we have traditionally named ""themes"", we needed a more precise definition of symlink support in Hugo:


Symlinks are not supported outside of the main project ((the project you run hugo or hugo server from).

In the main project static mounts, only symlinks to files are supported.
In all other mounts in the main project, both file and directory symlinks are allowed.

Notes
We  have removed the ""auto theme namespacing"" of  params from theme configuration. This was an undocumented and hidden feature that wasn't useful in practice.
We have revised and improved the symlinks support in Hugo: In earlier versions, symlinks were only fully supported for the content folders. With the introduction of the new very flexible file mounts, with content support even for what we have traditionally named ""themes"", we needed a more precise definition of symlink support in Hugo:
Symlinks are not supported outside of the main project ((the project you run hugo or hugo server from).
In the main project static mounts, only symlinks to files are supported.
In all other mounts in the main project, both file and directory symlinks are allowed.

147,"Hugo 0.55 is the early Easter Egg Edition with lots of great improvements and fixes. The original motivation for this release was to prepare for Issue #5074, but the structural changes needed for that paved the way for lots of others. Please study the list of changes below, and especially the Notes section, but some headlines include:
Virtualized Output Formats
Custom Output Formats has been a really useful feature, but it has had some annoying and not so obvious restrictions that are now lifted. Now all Page collections are aware of the output format being rendered. This means, to give some examples, that:

In a RSS template, listing pages with their content will use output format specific shortcode templates even if the pages themselves are not configured to output to that output format.
Using .Render when looping over a Page collection will now work as expected.
Every Output Format can be paginated.

We have now also added a new Permalinkable configuration attribute, which is enabled by default for HTML and AMP.
Shortcodes Revised
Shortcodes using the {{% as the outer-most delimiter will now be fully rendered when sent to the content renderer (e.g. Blackfriday for Markdown), meaning they can be part of the generated table of contents, footnotes, etc.
If you want the old behavior, you can put the following line in the start of your shortcode template:
{{ $_hugo_config := `{ ""version"": 1 }` }}
But using the {{< delimiter will, in most cases, be a better alternative, possibly in combination with the markdownify template func.
See #5763.
New Return Keyword for Partials
Hugo's partial and partialCached are great for template macros. With the new return keyword you can write partials as proper functions that can return any type:
go-html-template
{{ $v := add . 42 }}
{{ return $v }}
See #5783.
.Page on Taxonomy nodes
The taxonomy nodes now have a .Page accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper .Title etc. This means that older and clumsy constructs can be simplified. Some examples:
```go-html-template

    {{ range .Data.Terms.Alphabetical }}
            {{ .Page.Title }} {{ .Count }}
    {{ end }}

```
```go-html-template

    {{ range .Site.Taxonomies.tags }}
            {{ .Page.Title }} {{ .Count }}
    {{ end }}

```
See #5719.
And it's Faster!
This version is also the fastest to date. A site building benchmark shows more than 10% decrease in both build time and memory consumption, but that depends on the site. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously improve performance. Also, note that we are now more honest about build times reported (Total in 1234 ms). We now do all initialization in the Build step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have --enableGitInfo enabled, which now is included in the reported time.

Thanks!
This release represents 59 contributions by 10 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @mcdee, @quasilyte, and @danielcompton for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 36 contributions by 21 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @peaceiris, @budparr, and @tinymachine for their work on the documentation site.
As this release has required a significant effort with manual testing, a special thanks go to @onedrawingperday (the 300 theme demo sites have been invaluable to check for API-breakage!), @adiabatic, and @divinerites.

Notes

{{ % as the outer-most shortcode delimiter means ""pass the inner content to the content renderer"" (e.g. Blackfriday);  the old behavior can be had, see  #5763
preserveTaxonomyNamesconfiguration option is removed. Use .Page.Title.
We no longer limit the number of pages passed to the RSS Output Format. We have moved that limit to the internal RSS template, and you can do so yourself using the Config.Services.RSS.Limit in your custom template.
We no longer add XML headers to Output Formats that output XML (<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" standalone=""yes"" ?>). This header is moved to the templates. If you have custom RSS or sitemap templates you may want to add the XML declaration to these. Since they, by default, is handled by Go's HTML template package, you must do something like this to make sure it's preserved: {{ printf ""<?xml version=\""1.0\"" encoding=\""utf-8\"" standalone=\""yes\"" ?>"" | safeHTML }}
More honest build times reported (Total in 1234 ms). We now do all initialization in the Build step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have --enableGitInfo enabled, which now is included in the reported time.
The taxonomy nodes now have a .Page accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper .Title etc. see #5719.
The template keywords with and if now work properly for zero and interface types, see #5739
Taxonomy terms lists (Page of Kind taxonomyTerm) without any date(s) set (e.g. from front matter) will now pick the latest dates from the child pages. This is in line with how other branch nodes work in Hugo.
A new configuration option, Permalinkable, is added to Output Format and enabled that by default for HTML and AMP types. See  #5706 
--stepAnalysis is removed. If you want to really understand the latency in your project in Hugo, try the new --trace flag and pass that file to the many tools that read Go Trace files. There are also some newly hidden flags in --profile-cpu, --profile-men, --profile-mutex, hidden because they are considered to be only of interest to developers.
Chroma is updated with many fixes and new lexers, see #5797
We now support Page-relative aliases, e.g. aliases that do not start with a /, see #5757
We now support context-relative (language) URLs in front matter, meaning that in most cases url: /en/mypage can be replaced with the more portable url: mypage. See #5704

","Hugo 0.55 is the early Easter Egg Edition with lots of great improvements and fixes. The original motivation for this release was to prepare for Issue #5074, but the structural changes needed for that paved the way for lots of others. Please study the list of changes below, and especially the Notes section, but some headlines include:
Virtualized Output Formats
Custom Output Formats has been a really useful feature, but it has had some annoying and not so obvious restrictions that are now lifted. Now all Page collections are aware of the output format being rendered. This means, to give some examples, that:
In a RSS template, listing pages with their content will use output format specific shortcode templates even if the pages themselves are not configured to output to that output format.
Using .Render when looping over a Page collection will now work as expected.
Every Output Format can be paginated.
We have now also added a new Permalinkable configuration attribute, which is enabled by default for HTML and AMP.
Shortcodes Revised
Shortcodes using the {{% as the outer-most delimiter will now be fully rendered when sent to the content renderer (e.g. Blackfriday for Markdown), meaning they can be part of the generated table of contents, footnotes, etc.
If you want the old behavior, you can put the following line in the start of your shortcode template:
{{ $_hugo_config := module }}
But using the {{< delimiter will, in most cases, be a better alternative, possibly in combination with the markdownify template func.
See #5763.
New Return Keyword for Partials
Hugo's partial and partialCached are great for template macros. With the new return keyword you can write partials as proper functions that can return any type:
go-html-template
{{ $v := add . 42 }}
{{ return $v }}
See #5783.
.Page on Taxonomy nodes
The taxonomy nodes now have a .Page accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper .Title etc. This means that older and clumsy constructs can be simplified. Some examples:
```go-html-template
module
modulego-html-template
module
```
See #5719.
And it's Faster!
This version is also the fastest to date. A site building benchmark shows more than 10% decrease in both build time and memory consumption, but that depends on the site. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously improve performance. Also, note that we are now more honest about build times reported (Total in 1234 ms). We now do all initialization in the Build step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have --enableGitInfo enabled, which now is included in the reported time.
Thanks!
This release represents 59 contributions by 10 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @mcdee, @quasilyte, and @danielcompton for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 36 contributions by 21 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @peaceiris, @budparr, and @tinymachine for their work on the documentation site.
As this release has required a significant effort with manual testing, a special thanks go to @onedrawingperday (the 300 theme demo sites have been invaluable to check for API-breakage!), @adiabatic, and @divinerites.
Hugo now has:
34077+ stars
439+ contributors
306+ themes
Notes
{{ % as the outer-most shortcode delimiter means ""pass the inner content to the content renderer"" (e.g. Blackfriday);  the old behavior can be had, see  #5763
preserveTaxonomyNamesconfiguration option is removed. Use .Page.Title.
We no longer limit the number of pages passed to the RSS Output Format. We have moved that limit to the internal RSS template, and you can do so yourself using the Config.Services.RSS.Limit in your custom template.
We no longer add XML headers to Output Formats that output XML (<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" standalone=""yes"" ?>). This header is moved to the templates. If you have custom RSS or sitemap templates you may want to add the XML declaration to these. Since they, by default, is handled by Go's HTML template package, you must do something like this to make sure it's preserved: {{ printf ""<?xml version=\""1.0\"" encoding=\""utf-8\"" standalone=\""yes\"" ?>"" | safeHTML }}
More honest build times reported (Total in 1234 ms). We now do all initialization in the Build step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have --enableGitInfo enabled, which now is included in the reported time.
The taxonomy nodes now have a .Page accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper .Title etc. see #5719.
The template keywords with and if now work properly for zero and interface types, see #5739
Taxonomy terms lists (Page of Kind taxonomyTerm) without any date(s) set (e.g. from front matter) will now pick the latest dates from the child pages. This is in line with how other branch nodes work in Hugo.
A new configuration option, Permalinkable, is added to Output Format and enabled that by default for HTML and AMP types. See  #5706 
--stepAnalysis is removed. If you want to really understand the latency in your project in Hugo, try the new --trace flag and pass that file to the many tools that read Go Trace files. There are also some newly hidden flags in --profile-cpu, --profile-men, --profile-mutex, hidden because they are considered to be only of interest to developers.
Chroma is updated with many fixes and new lexers, see #5797
We now support Page-relative aliases, e.g. aliases that do not start with a /, see #5757
We now support context-relative (language) URLs in front matter, meaning that in most cases url: /en/mypage can be replaced with the more portable url: mypage. See #5704

149,"From all of us to all of you, a very Merry Christmas -- and Hugo 0.53!
The main new features in this release are:

You can now split your configuration into directories per environment. Hugo did support multiple configuration files before this release, but it was hard to manage for bigger sites, especially those with multiple languages. With this we have also formalized the concept of an environment; the defaults are production (when running hugo) or development (when running hugo server) but you can create any environment you like.  We will update the documentation, but all the details are in this issue. Also, see this PR for how the refactored configuration for the Hugo website looks like.
transform.Unmarshal (see the documentation is a new and powerful template function that can turn Resource objects or strings with JSON, TOML, YAML or CSV into maps/arrays.
Two new global variables in site and hugo. hugo gives you version info etc. ({{ hugo.Version }}, {{ hugo.Environment }}), but the site is probably more useful, as it allows you to access the current site's variables (e.g. {{ site.RegularPages }}) without any context (or ""."").

This version is also the fastest to date. A site building benchmark shows around 10% faster, but that depends on the site. The important part here is that we're not getting slower.  It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously improve performance. It's like not gaining weight during Christmas. We also had a small performance boost in version 0.50. A user then reported that his big and complicated site had a 30% reduction in build time. This is important to us, one of the core features. It's in the slogan: ""The world’s fastest framework for building websites.""

Notes

The hugo benchmark command is removed
We now do not publish transformed inline resources, e.g. minified CSS only accessed via .Content., e.g. {{ ($css | minify).Content }}. Before this version, the minified CSS in that example would be copied to /public, which was never the intention. If you want that, you need to access either .RelPermalink or .Permalink.

150,"The two big new items in this release is Inline Shortcodes and Consolidated File Caches. In Hugo we really care about build speed, and caching is important. With this release, you get much better control over your cache configuration, which is especially useful when building on a Continous Integration server (Netlify, CircleCI or similar). Inline Shortcodes was implemented to help the Bootstrap project move their documentation site to Hugo. Note that this feature is disabled by default. To enable, set enableInlineShortcodes = true in your site config. Worth mentioning is also the new param shortcode, which looks up the param in page front matter with the site's parameter as a fall back.

152,"Hugo 0.50 brings greatly improved error messages, and we now also show them in the browser. Having error messages with filename, line- and column number greatly simplify troubleshooting. Many editors (like VS Code) even let you click and navigate directly to the problematic line. If your editor requires a different log format, you can set it via the HUGO_FILE_LOG_FORMAT OS environment variable:
bash
env HUGO_FILE_LOG_FORMAT=""\"":file::line::col\"""" hugo server
But this release isn't all about error handling. Getting line- and column number into ""every"" error also meant that we had to consolidate and simplify some code paths, which, as a nice side effect, made Hugo a little bit faster. Benchmarks show it running about 5% faster and consume about 8% less memory.
Also, we have now implemented ""render on demand"" in Hugo's Fast Render Mode (default when running hugo server). This means that you should now always see updated content when navigating around the site after a change.
This release represents 88 contributions by 14 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @moorereason, @anthonyfok, and @GregorioMartinez for their ongoing contributions.

But this release is also about collections. Go 1.11 gave us variable overwrite support in Go templates. That made it possible to simplify a lot of template constructs, but it also showed some limitations in Hugo's template functions. So with this release we have:

added append function to append to collections.
added group to create custom page groups.

156,"Hugo 0.48 is built with the brand new Go 1.11. On the technical side this means that Hugo now uses Go Modules for the build. The big new functional thing in Go 1.11 for Hugo is added support for variable overwrites. This means that you can now do:
{{ $var := ""Hugo Page"" }}
{{ if .IsHome }}
{{ $var = ""Hugo Home"" }}

","Hugo 0.47 is named Hugo Reloaded. It adds minification support for the final rendered output (run hugo --minify), but it is mostly a bug fix release. And most notably, it fixes a set of issues with live-reloading/partial rebuilds when running hugo server. Working with bundles should now be a more pleasant experience, to pick one example.
This release represents 35 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @satotake, @anthonyfok, and @coliff for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman and @onedrawingperday  for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to @kaushalmodi for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 21 contributions by 10 contributors. A special thanks to @bep, @aapeliv, @regisphilibert, and @brentybh for their work on the documentation site.

159,"Hugo 0.46 is the closing credits to The Summer of Hugo. While most people have been relaxing on the beach, Hugo has been really busy: 

0.42, June 12, 2018: Theme Composition and Inheritance!
0.43, July 9, 2018: Hugo Pipes!

This was followed by some more technical follow-up releases. And today, when July has turned into August, we come with another one. It's not a big release. But with the big interest in Hugo Pipes, we felt that it was important to get this out there sooner rather than later.
There are two main items in this release:

We have added a custom SCSS/SASS import resolver that respects Hugo's project/themes filesystem hierarchy anywhere in /assets. Using the LibSass' resolver alone only made this work for the entry folder.
Resources fetched via resources.Get and similar are now language agnostic. The thought behind the original implementation was maximum flexibility with support for assetDir per language. In practice, this was a bad idea, as it made some CSS imports hard to get working in multilingual setups, and you got duplication of identical content for no good reason, with added processing time.

This release represents 12 contributions by 2 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
A special thanks in this release goes to @onedrawingperday for his excellent work maintaining the fast-growing Themes Site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs, 
which has received 5 contributions by 3 contributors.
Hugo now has:

27596+ stars
442+ contributors
245+ themes

Notes

Resources fetched via resources.Get and similar are now considered global across languages. If you need, as an example, to create a CSS per language, you need to set the path yourself.

Enhancements

Add templates.Exists template function. This can be used to check if a template, e.g. a partial, exists in the project or any of the themes in use. 0ba19c57 @bep #5010

161,"Hugo 0.45 is the revival of ref, relref and GetPage. @vassudanagunta and @bep have done some great work improving the API and implementation for the helper functions used to get one page. Before this release, the API was a little bit clumsy and the result potentially ambiguous in some situations.
Now you can simply do:
go-html-template
{{ with .Site.GetPage ""/blog/my-post.md"" }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }}
Or to get a section page:
go-html-template
{{ with .Site.GetPage ""/blog"" }}{{ .Title }}{{ end }}
We have also added a .GetPage method on Page and added support for page-relative linking. This means that the leading slash (/) now has a meaning. For .Site.GetPage, all lookups will start at the content root. But for lookups with a Page context, paths without a leading slash will be treated as relative to the page.
This means that the following example will find the page in the current section:
go-html-template
{{< ref ""my-post.md"" >}}
You can also use the .. to refer to a page one level up etc.:
go-html-template
{{< ref ""../my-post.md"" >}}
We have now also added language support to ref and relref, so you can link to a page in another language:
go-html-template
{{< relref path=""document.md"" lang=""jp"" >}}
To link to a given Output Format of a document, you can use this syntax:
go-html-template
{{< relref path=""document.md"" outputFormat=""rss"" >}}
To make working with these reflinks on bigger sites easier to work with, we have also improved the error logging, and added two new configuration settings:

refLinksErrorLevel: ERROR (default, will fail the build when a reflink cannot be resolved) or WARNING.
refLinksNotFoundURL: Set this to an URL placeholder used when no reference could be resolved.

Visit the Hugo Docs for more information.
We have also done some important improvements and fixes in Hugo Pipes in this release: SCSS source maps on Windows now works, we now support project-local PostCSS installation, and we have added IncludePaths to SCSS options, making it possible to include, say, a path below node_modules in the SASS/SCSS build.
This release represents 31 contributions by 4 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @vassudanagunta, @hairmare, and @garrmcnu for their ongoing contributions.

Notes

.Site.GetPage with more than 2 arguments will not work anymore. This means that {{ .Site.GetPage ""page"" ""blog"" ""my-post.md"" }} will fail. {{ .Site.GetPage ""page"" ""blog/my-post.md"" }} will work, but we recommend you use the simpler {{ .Site.GetPage ""/blog/my-post.md"" }}
Relative paths in relref or ref that finds its match not relative to the page itself will work, but we now print a warning saying that you should correct it to an absolute path. E.g. {{<!--* ref ""blog/my-post.md"" */-->}} => {{<!--* ref ""/blog/my-post.md"" */-->}}.

This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.
Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the hugo server. With Hugo Pipes MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo's use of Suffix was ambiguous. This became visible when we redefined the image/svg+xml to work with Hugo Pipes. We have now added a Suffixes field on the MIME type definition in Hugo, which is a list of one or more filename suffixes the MIME type is identified with. If you need to add a custom MIME type definition, this means that you also need to specify the full MIME type as the key, e.g. image/svg+xml.

163,"Windows users, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4919
Hugo 0.43 adds a powerful and very simple to use Assets Pipeline with SASS and SCSS with source map support, PostCSS and minification and fingerprinting and Subresource Integrity and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do ad-hoc image processing and execute text resources as Go templates?
An example pipeline:
go-html-template
{{ $styles := resources.Get ""scss/main.scss"" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }}
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ $styles.Permalink }}"" integrity=""{{ $styles.Data.Integrity }}"" media=""screen"">
To me, the above is beautiful in its speed and simplicity. It could be printed on a t-shirt. I wrote in the Hugo Birthday Post some days ago about the value of a single binary with native and fast implementations. I should have added simplicity as a keyword. There seem to be a misconception that all of this needs to be hard and painful.
New functions to create Resource objects:

resources.Get
resources.FromString: Create a Resource from a string.

New Resource transformation funcs:

resources.ToCSS: Compile SCSS or SASS into CSS.
resources.PostCSS: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option).
resources.Minify: Currently supports css, js, json, html, svg, xml.
resources.Fingerprint: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.

Hugo is now released with two binary version: One with and one without SCSS/SASS support. At the time of writing, this is only available in the binaries on the GitHub release page. Brew, Snap builds etc. will come. But note that you only need the extended version if you want to edit SCSS. For your CI server, or if you don't use SCSS, you will most likely want the non-extended version.

Hugo 0.43 adds a powerful and very simple to use Assets Pipeline with SASS and SCSS with source map support, PostCSS and minification and fingerprinting and Subresource Integrity and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do ad-hoc image processing and execute text resources as Go templates?
An example pipeline:
go-html-template
{{ $styles := resources.Get ""scss/main.scss"" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }}

To me, the above is beautiful in its speed and simplicity. It could be printed on a t-shirt. I wrote in the Hugo Birthday Post some days ago about the value of a single binary with native and fast implementations. I should have added simplicity as a keyword. There seem to be a misconception that all of this needs to be hard and painful.
New functions to create Resource objects:
resources.Get
resources.FromString: Create a Resource from a string.
New Resource transformation funcs:
resources.ToCSS: Compile SCSS or SASS into CSS.
resources.PostCSS: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option).
resources.Minify: Currently supports css, js, json, html, svg, xml.
resources.Fingerprint: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.
resources.Concat: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler.
resources.ExecuteAsTemplate: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template.

The speakerdeck shortcode is removed. It didn't work properly, so is isn't expected to be in wide use. If you use it, you will get a build error. You will either have to remove its usage or add a speakerdeck shortcode to your own project or theme.
We have now virtualized the filesystems for project and theme files. This makes everything simpler, faster and more powerful. But it also means that template lookups on the form {{ template “theme/partials/pagination.html” . }} will not work anymore. That syntax has never been documented, so it's not expected to be in wide use. {{ partial ""pagination.html"" . }} will give you the most specific version of that partial.

171,"Hugo 0.40 is The Revival of the Shortcodes. Shortcodes is one of the prime features in Hugo. Really useful, but it has had some known shortcomings. @bep has been really busy the last week to address those.
In summary:

.Content for a page retrieved in a query in a shortcode is now almost always available. Note that shortcodes can include content that can include shortcodes that can include content... It is possible to bite your tail. See more below.
Shortcodes are now processed and rendered in their order of appearance.
Related to the above, we have now added a zero-based .Ordinal to the shortcode.

The first bullet above resolves some surprising behaviour when reading other pages' content from shortcodes. Before this release, that behaviour was undefined. Note that this has never been an issue from regular templates.
It will still not be possible to get the current shortcode's  page's rendered content. That would have impressed Einstein.
The new and well defined rules are:

.Page.Content from a shortcode will be empty. The related .Page.Truncated .Page.Summary, .Page.WordCount, .Page.ReadingTime, .Page.Plain and .Page.PlainWords will also have empty values.
For other pages (retrieved via .Page.Site.GetPage, .Site.Pages etc.) the .Content is there to use as you please as long as you don't have infinite content recursion in your shortcode/content setup. See below.
.Page.TableOfContents is good to go (but does not support shortcodes in headlines; this is unchanged)

If you get into a situation of infinite recursion, the .Content will be empty. Run hugo -v for more information.

Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in hugoDocs,

Hugo now has:

25071+ stars
446+ contributors
222+ themes

Notes

We have added a timeout configuration setting. This is currently only used to time out the .Content creation, to bail out of recursive recursions. Run hugo -v to see potential warnings about this. The timeout is set default to 10000 (10 seconds).

Built with go version go1.10.1 linux/amd64","Hugo 0.40 is The Revival of the Shortcodes. Shortcodes is one of the prime features in Hugo. Really useful, but it has had some known shortcomings. @bep has been really busy the last week to address those.
In summary:
.Content for a page retrieved in a query in a shortcode is now almost always available. Note that shortcodes can include content that can include shortcodes that can include content... It is possible to bite your tail. See more below.
Shortcodes are now processed and rendered in their order of appearance.
Related to the above, we have now added a zero-based .Ordinal to the shortcode.
The first bullet above resolves some surprising behaviour when reading other pages' content from shortcodes. Before this release, that behaviour was undefined. Note that this has never been an issue from regular templates.
It will still not be possible to get the current shortcode's  page's rendered content. That would have impressed Einstein.
The new and well defined rules are:
.Page.Content from a shortcode will be empty. The related .Page.Truncated .Page.Summary, .Page.WordCount, .Page.ReadingTime, .Page.Plain and .Page.PlainWords will also have empty values.
For other pages (retrieved via .Page.Site.GetPage, .Site.Pages etc.) the .Content is there to use as you please as long as you don't have infinite content recursion in your shortcode/content setup. See below.
.Page.TableOfContents is good to go (but does not support shortcodes in headlines; this is unchanged)
If you get into a situation of infinite recursion, the .Content will be empty. Run hugo -v for more information.

172,"Nat King Cole was a fantastic American jazz pianist. When his bass player had visited the bar a little too often, he started with his percussive    piano playing to keep the tempo flowing. Oscar Peterson called it ""Nat's stabilizers"". This release is the software equivalent of that. We have been doing frequent main releases this year, but looking back, the patch releases that followed them seemed unneeded. And looking at the regressions, most of them stem from the commands package, a package that before this release was filled with globals and high coupling. This package is now rewritten and accompanied with decent test coverage.

Notes

Hugo will now convert non-string YAML map keys to string.  See #4393 for more information. You will get a WARNING in the console if you are touched by this.
We have improved the PNG processing, and have incremented the version numbers on the URL for the processed PNG image. This will just work, but you may want to run hugo --gc to clean up some old stale images in the resource cache.

Built with go version go1.10 linux/amd64","The main item in Hugo 0.37 is that we now properly preserve the colour palette when processing PNG images. We got reports from users experiencing their PNG images getting bigger in file size when scaled down.   Now, if you, as an example, start out with a carefully chosen 8 bit colour palette (i.e. PNG-8), this is now what you will end up with.

178,"This release fixes a multi-thread issue when reprocessing and reusing images across pages. When doing something like this with the same image from a partial used in, say, both the home page and the single page:
bash
{{ with $img }}
{{ $big := .Fill ""1024x512 top"" }}
{{ $small := $big.Resize ""512x"" }}
{{ end }}
There would be timing issues making Hugo in some cases trying to process the same image twice at the same time.
You would experience errors of type:
bash
png: invalid format: not enough pixel data
This commit fixes that by adding a mutex per image. This should also improve the performance, sligthly, as it avoids duplicate work.
The current workaround before this fix is to always operate on the original:
bash
{{ with $img }}
{{ $big := .Fill ""1024x512 top"" }}
{{ $small := .Fill ""512x256 top"" }}

181,"Hugo 0.34 is a small release. It contains a few smaller bug-fixes, but more important is an overhaul of the API used to find images and other resources in your page bundles.
We have added two simple methods on the Resources object:

.Match finds every resource matching a pattern. Examples: .Match ""images/*.jpg"" finds every JPEG image in images and .Match ""**.jpg"" finds every JPEG image in the bundle.
.GetMatch finds the first resource matching the pattern given.

Note: The path separators used are Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows.
It uses standard wildcard syntax with the addition of the **, aka super-asterisk, which matches across path boundaries.

182,"Hugo 0.33 is the first main Hugo release of the new year, and it is safe to say that @bep  has turned off his lazy Christmas mode :smiley:
This is a full makeover of the layout selection logic with full custom layout and type support (many have asked for this). Also, Hugo now respects the url value in front matter for all page types, including sections. Also, you can now configure uglyURLs per section.
But this release is also a follow-up to the 0.32 release which was all about bundles with resources and powerful image processing. With this release it is now simple to add metadata to your images and other bundle resources. 
@bep  has added a section with examples of both resources configuration in both YAML and TOML front matter in his test site. The example below shows a sample of how it would look like in YAML:
yaml
date: 2017-01-17
title: My Bundle With YAML Resource Metadata
resources:
- src: ""image-4.png""
  title: ""The Fourth Image""
- src: ""*.png""
  name: ""my-cool-image-:counter""
  title: ""The Image #:counter""
  params:
    byline: ""bep""

22553+ stars
448+ contributors

Notes

We have re-implemented and unified the template layout lookup logic. This has made it more powerful and much simpler to understand. We don't expect any sites to break because of this. We have tested lots of Hugo sites, including the 200 themes.
The indexes type is removed from template lookup. It's not in the documentation, and is a legacy term inherited from very old Hugo versions.
If you have sub-dirs in your shiny new bundles (e.g. my-bundle/images) and use the *Prefix* methods to find them, we have made an unintended change that affects you. See this issue.

Built with go version go1.9.2 linux/amd64","Hugo 0.33 is the first main Hugo release of the new year, and it is safe to say that @bep  has turned off his lazy Christmas mode :smiley:
This is a full makeover of the layout selection logic with full custom layout and type support (many have asked for this). Also, Hugo now respects the url value in front matter for all page types, including sections. Also, you can now configure uglyURLs per section.
But this release is also a follow-up to the 0.32 release which was all about bundles with resources and powerful image processing. With this release it is now simple to add metadata to your images and other bundle resources. 
@bep  has added a section with examples of both resources configuration in both YAML and TOML front matter in his test site. The example below shows a sample of how it would look like in YAML:
yaml
date: 2017-01-17
title: My Bundle With YAML Resource Metadata
resources:
- src: ""image-4.png""
  title: ""The Fourth Image""
- src: ""*.png""
  name: ""my-cool-image-:counter""
  title: ""The Image #:counter""
  params:
    byline: ""bep""
This release represents 41 contributions by 3 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
Hugo now has:
22553+ stars
448+ contributors
197+ themes
Notes
We have re-implemented and unified the template layout lookup logic. This has made it more powerful and much simpler to understand. We don't expect any sites to break because of this. We have tested lots of Hugo sites, including the 200 themes.
The indexes type is removed from template lookup. It's not in the documentation, and is a legacy term inherited from very old Hugo versions.
If you have sub-dirs in your shiny new bundles (e.g. my-bundle/images) and use the Prefix methods to find them, we have made an unintended change that affects you. See this issue.

A Resource will have its RelPermalink and Permalink relative to the ""owning page"". This makes the complete article with both text and images portable (just send a ZIP file with a folder to your editor), and it can be previewed directly on GitHub.
Powerful and simple to use image processing with the new .Resize, .Fill, and .Fit methods on the new Image resource.
Full support for symbolic links inside /content, both for regular files and directories.

The built-in benchmarks in Hugo show that this is also the fastest and most memory effective Hugo version to date. But note that the build time total reported in the console is now adjusted to be the real total, including the copy of static files. So, if it reports more milliseconds, it is still most likely faster ...

Hugo now has:

22061+ stars
454+ contributors
193+ themes

Today is New Year's Eve. It is the last day of 2017, a year that have seen a string of pearls of Hugo releases, making Hugo the top choice for website development:

0.32, December 2017: Page Bundles and Image Processing edition.
0.31, November 2017: The Language Multihost Edition! with one baseURL per language.
0.30, October 2017: The Race Car Edition with the Fast Render Mode.
0.29, September 2017: Added Template Metrics.
0.28, September 2017:  Blistering fast and native syntax highlighting from Chroma.
0.27, September 2017: Fast and flexible Related Content.
0.26, August 2017: The Language Style Edition  with AP Style or Chicago Style Title Case and « French Guillemets ».
0.25, July 2017: The Kinder Surprise edition added, among other cool things, hugo server --navigateToChanged which navigates to the content page you start editing.
0.24, June 2017: Was The Revival of the Archetypes! Now archetype files, i.e. the content file templates, can include template syntax with all of Hugo's functions and variables.
0.23, June 2017: Hugo moved to it's own GitHub organization, gohugoio.
0.22, June 2017: Added nested sections, a long sought after feature.
0.21, May 2017: Full support for shortcodes per output format (think AMP).
0.20, April 2017: Was all about Custom Output Formats.
0.19, February 2017: Native Emacs Org-mode content support and lots of internal upgrades.

Notes

The build total in the console is now the ... total (i.e. it now includes both the copy of the static files and the Hugo build). So if your Hugo site seems to build slightly slower, it is in reality probably slightly faster than before this release.
Images and other static resources in folders with ""_index.md"" will have its RelPermalink relative to its page.
Images and other static resources in or below ""index.md"" folders will have its RelPermalink relative to its page (respecting permalink settings etc.)
Content pages in or below ""index.md"" will not get their own URL, but will be part of the .Resources collection of its page.
.Site.Files is deprecated.
Hugo no longer minfies CSS files inside /content. This was an undocumented ""proof of concept feature"". We may revisit the ""assets handling"" in a future release.    
Page.GetParamdoes not lowercase your result anymore. If you really want to lowercase your params, do it with .GetParam ""myparam"" | lower or similar.

Previously deprecated that will now ERROR:

It is hard to explain, so start the Hugo development server with hugo server and start editing. Live reloads just got so much faster! The ""how and what"" is discussed at length in other places, but the short version is that we now re-render only the parts of the site that you are working on.
The second performance-related feature is a follow-up to the Template Metrics added in Hugo 0.29. Now, if you add the flag --templateMetricsHints, we will calculate a score for how your partials can be cached (with the partialCached template func).
This release also more or less makes the really fast Chroma highlighter a complete alternative to Pygments. Most noteable is the new table linenos support (7c30e2cb @bep #3915), which makes copy-and-paste code blocks much easier.

Notes

Running hugo server will now run with the new ""Fast Render Mode"" default on. To turn it off, run hugo server --disableFastRender or set disableFastRender=true in your site config.
There have been several fixes and enhancements in the Chroma highlighter. One is that it now creates Pygments compatible CSS classes, which means that you may want to re-generate the stylesheet. See the Syntax Highlighting Doc.

194,"Hugo 0.28 brings blistering fast and native syntax highlighting from Chroma (fb33d828 @bep #3888). A big thank you to Alec Thomas for taking on this massive task of porting the popular python highlighter Pygments to Go.
See the Updated Documentation for more information about how this works.
Worth mentioning is also the liveReloadPort  flag on hugo server, which makes it possible to do ""live reloads"" behind a HTTPS proxy, which makes for very cool remote customer demos. 
One example would be a Hugo server running behind a ngrok tunnel:
bash
ngrok http 1313
Then start the Hugo server with:
bash
hugo server -b https://youridhere.ngrok.io --appendPort=false --liveReloadPort=443 --navigateToChanged
The navigateToChanged flag is slightly unrelated, but it is super cool ...

Notes

Hugo now uses Chroma as new default syntax highlighter. This should in most cases work out-of-the box or with very little adjustments. But if you want to continue to use Pygments, set pygmentsUseClassic=true in your site config.
We now add a set of ""no cache"" headers to the responses for hugo server, which makes the most sense in most development scenarios. Run with hugo server --noHTTPCache=false to get the old behaviour.

199,"Hugo 0.25 is the Kinder Surprise: It automatically opens the page you're working on in the browser, it adds full AND and OR support in page queries, and you can now have templates per language.

If you start with hugo server --navigateToChanged, Hugo will navigate to the relevant page on save (see animated GIF). This is extremely useful for site-wide edits. Another very useful feature in this version is the added support for AND (intersect)  and OR (union)  filters when combined with where.
Example:
go
{{ $pages := where .Site.RegularPages ""Type"" ""not in"" (slice ""page"" ""about"") }}
{{ $pages := $pages | union (where .Site.RegularPages ""Params.pinned"" true) }}
{{ $pages := $pages | intersect (where .Site.RegularPages ""Params.images"" ""!="" nil) }}
The above fetches regular pages not of page or about type unless they are pinned. And finally, we exclude all pages with no images set in Page params.
This release represents 36 contributions by 12 contributors to the main Hugo code base. @bep still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. But also a big shoutout to @yihui, @anthonyfok, and @kropp for their ongoing contributions. And as always a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition.

201,"This is The Revival of the Archetypes!

""A feature that could be the name of the next Indiana Jones movie deserves its own release,"" says @bep.

Hugo now handles the archetype files as Go templates. This means that the issues with sorting and lost comments are long gone. This also means that you will have to supply all values, including title and date. But this also opens up a lot of new windows.
A fictional example for the section newsletter and the archetype file archetypes/newsletter.md:
```markdown
title: ""{{ replace .TranslationBaseName ""-"" "" "" | title }}""
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true

Insert Lead paragraph here.
more
New Cool Posts
{{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages ""Type"" ""cool"" ) }}
* {{ .Title }}
{{ end }}
```
And then create a new post with:
bash
hugo new newsletter/the-latest-cool.stuff.md
Note: the site will only be built if the .Site is in use in the archetype file, and this can be time consuming for big sites.
Hot Tip: If you set the newContentEditor configuration variable to an editor on your PATH, the newly created article will be opened.
The above newsletter type archetype illustrates the possibilities: The full Hugo .Site and all of Hugo's template funcs can be used in the archetype file.
Also, Hugo now supports archetype files for all content formats, not just markdown.
Hugo now has:

17839+ stars
493+ contributors
166+ themes

Notes

Archetype files now need to be complete, including title and date.
The -f (format) flag in hugo new is removed: Now use the archetype files as is.

Enhancements

Support extension-less media types. The motivation behind this change is to support Netlify's _redirects files, so we can generate server-side redirects for the Hugo docs site. See this commit to see how we configured that. 0f40e1fa @bep #3614

Also, considerable work has been put into writing automated benchmark tests for the site builds, and we're happy to report that although this release comes with fundamental structural changes, this version is -- in general -- even faster than the previous. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously maintain the stellar performance Hugo is famous for. 
Notes
.Site.Sections is replaced. We have reworked how sections work in Hugo, they can now be nested and are no longer taxonomies. If you use the old collection, you should get detailed upgrade instructions in the log when you run hugo. For more information, see this demo site.

@bep leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to @moorereason, @bogem, and @munnerz for their ongoing contributions. And as always a big thanks to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition.
Other Highlights
On a more technical side, @moorereason and @bep have introduced namespaces for Hugo's many template funcs (#3042 ). There are so many now, and adding more into that big pile would be a sure path toward losing control.  Now they are nicely categorised into namespaces with its own tests and examples, with an API that the documentation site can use to make sure it is correct and up-to-date.

211,"0.20.2 April 16th 2017
Hugo 0.20.2 adds support for plain text partials included into HTML templates. This was a side-effect of the big new Custom Output Format feature in 0.20, and while the change was intentional and there was an ongoing discussion about fixing it in #3273, it did break some themes. There were valid workarounds for these themes, but we might as well get it right.
The most obvious use case for this is inline CSS styles, which you now can do without having to name your partials with a html suffix.
A simple example:
In layouts/partials/mystyles.css:
body {
    background-color: {{ .Param ""colors.main"" }}
}

Then in config.toml (note that by using the .Param lookup func, we can override the color in a page’s front matter if we want):
[params]
[params.colors]
main = ""green""
text = ""blue""

And then in layouts/partials/head.html (or the partial used to include the head section into your layout):
<head>
    <style type=""text/css"">
    {{ partial ""mystyles.css"" . | safeCSS }}
    </style>
</head>

Of course, 0.20 also made it super-easy to create external CSS stylesheets based on your site and page configuration. A simple example:
Add “CSS” to your home page’s outputs list, create the template /layouts/index.css using Go template syntax for the dynamic parts, and then include it into your HTML template with:
{{ with  .OutputFormats.Get ""css"" }}
<link rel=""{{ .Rel }}"" type=""{{ .MediaType.Type }}"" href=""{{ .Permalink |  safeURL }}"">
{{ end }}`

Also a big shoutout to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and @moorereason and @bogem for their ongoing contributions.
Other Highlights
@bogem has also contributed TOML as an alternative and much simpler format for language/i18n files (#3200). A feature you will appreciate when you start to work on larger translations.
Also, there have been some important updates in the Emacs Org-mode handling: @chaseadamsio has fixed the newline-handling ( #3126 ) and @clockoon has added basic footnote support.
Worth mentioning is also the ongoing work that @rdwatters and @budparr is doing to re-do the gohugo.io site, including a total restructuring and partial rewrite of the documentation. It is getting close to finished, and it looks fantastic!
Notes

RSS description in the built-in template is changed from full .Content to .Summary. This is a somewhat breaking change, but is what most people expect from their RSS feeds. If you want full content, please provide your own RSS template.

We’re happy to announce the first release of Hugo in 2017.
This release represents over 180 contributions by over 50 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 1450 stars, 35 new contributors and 15 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   15200+ stars
-   470+ contributors
-   151+ themes
Furthermore, Hugo has its own Twitter account (@gohugoio) where we share bite-sized news and themes from the Hugo community.
@bep leads the Hugo development and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to @chaseadamsio for the Emacs Org-mode support, @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, @fj for his work on revising the params handling in Hugo, and @moorereason and @bogem for their ongoing contributions.
Highlights
Hugo 0.19 brings native Emacs Org-mode content support ( #1483 ), big thanks to @chaseadamsio.
Also, a considerably amount of work have been put into cleaning up the Hugo source code, in an issue titled Refactor the globals out of site build. This is not immediately visible to the Hugo end user, but will speed up future development.
Hugo 0.18 was bringing full-parallel page rendering, so workarounds depending on rendering order did not work anymore, and pages with duplicate target paths (common examples would be /index.md or /about/index.md) would now conflict with the home page or the section listing.
With Hugo 0.19, you can control this behaviour by turning off page types you do not want ( #2534 ). In its most extreme case, if you put the below setting in your config.toml, you will get nothing!:
disableKinds = [""page"", ""home"", ""section"", ""taxonomy"", ""taxonomyTerm"", ""RSS"", ""sitemap"", ""robotsTXT"", ""404""]
Other New Features

Add ability to sort pages by frontmatter parameters, enabling easy custom “top 10” page lists. #3022
Add truncate template function #2882
Add now function, which replaces the now deprecated .Now #2859
Make RSS item limit configurable #3035

Enhancements

","0.19 February 27th 2017
We’re happy to announce the first release of Hugo in 2017.
This release represents over 180 contributions by over 50 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 1450 stars, 35 new contributors and 15 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   15200+ stars
-   470+ contributors
-   151+ themes
Furthermore, Hugo has its own Twitter account (@gohugoio) where we share bite-sized news and themes from the Hugo community.
@bep leads the Hugo development and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to @chaseadamsio for the Emacs Org-mode support, @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, @fj for his work on revising the params handling in Hugo, and @moorereason and @bogem for their ongoing contributions.
Highlights
Hugo 0.19 brings native Emacs Org-mode content support ( #1483 ), big thanks to @chaseadamsio.
Also, a considerably amount of work have been put into cleaning up the Hugo source code, in an issue titled Refactor the globals out of site build. This is not immediately visible to the Hugo end user, but will speed up future development.
Hugo 0.18 was bringing full-parallel page rendering, so workarounds depending on rendering order did not work anymore, and pages with duplicate target paths (common examples would be /index.md or /about/index.md) would now conflict with the home page or the section listing.
With Hugo 0.19, you can control this behaviour by turning off page types you do not want ( #2534 ). In its most extreme case, if you put the below setting in your config.toml, you will get nothing!:
disableKinds = [""page"", ""home"", ""section"", ""taxonomy"", ""taxonomyTerm"", ""RSS"", ""sitemap"", ""robotsTXT"", ""404""]
Other New Features
Add ability to sort pages by frontmatter parameters, enabling easy custom “top 10” page lists. #3022
Add truncate template function #2882
Add now function, which replaces the now deprecated .Now #2859
Make RSS item limit configurable #3035

Today, we’re excited to release the much-anticipated Hugo 0.18!
We’re heading towards the end of the year 2016, and we can look back on three releases and a steady growing community around the project. This release includes over 220 contributions by nearly 50 contributors to the main codebase. Since the last release, Hugo has gained 1750 stars and 27 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   13750+ stars
-   408+ contributors
-   137+ themes
@bep once again took the lead of Hugo and contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to @digitalcraftsman for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and also a big thanks to @moorereason and @bogem for their contributions.
We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
The Hugo team
Highlights
The primary new feature in Hugo 0.18 is that every piece of content is now a Page ( #2297 ). This means that every page, including the home page, can have a content file with frontmatter. Not only is this a much simpler model to understand, it is also faster and paved the way for several important new features:
-   Enable proper titles for Nodes #1051
-   Sitemap.xml should include nodes, as well as pages #1303
-   Document homepage content workaround #2240
-   Allow home page to be easily authored in markdown #720
-   Minimalist website with homepage as content #330
Hugo again continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. Running this benchmark with these sites (renders to memory) shows about 60% reduction in time spent and 30% reduction in memory usage compared to Hugo 0.17.
Other New Features

Every Page now has a Kind property. Since everything is a Page now, the Kind is used to differentiate different kinds of pages. Possible values are page, home, section, taxonomy, and taxonomyTerm. (Internally, we also define RSS, sitemap, robotsTXT, and 404, but those have no practical use for end users at the moment since they are not included in any collections.)
Add a GitInfo object to Page if enableGitInfo is set. It then also sets Lastmod for the given Page to the author date provided by Git. #2291
Implement support for alias templates #2533
New template functions:
Add imageConfig function #2677
Add sha256 function #2762
Add partialCached template function #1368
Add shortcode to display Instagram images #2690
Add noChmod option to disable perm sync #2749
Add quiet build mode #1218

Notices

.Site.Pages will now contain several kinds of pages, including regular pages, sections, taxonomies, and the home page. If you want a specific kind of page, you can filter it with where and Kind. .Site.RegularPages is a shortcut to the page collection you have been used to getting.
RSSlink is now deprecated. Use RSSLink instead. Note that in Hugo 0.17 both of them existed, so there is a fifty-fifty chance you will not have to do anything (if you use a theme, the chance is close to 0), and RSSlink will still work for two Hugo versions.

Fixes

Revise the base template lookup logic so it now better matches the behavior of regular templates, making it easier to override the master templates from the theme #2783
Add workaround for block template crash. Block templates are very useful, but there is a bug in Go 1.6 and 1.7 which makes the template rendering crash if you use the block template in more complex scenarios. This is fixed in the upcoming Go 1.8, but Hugo adds a temporary workaround in Hugo 0.18. #2549
All the Params configurations are now case insensitive #1129 #2590 #2615
Make RawContent raw again #2601
Fix archetype title and date handling #2750
Fix TOML archetype parsing in hugo new #2745
Fix page sorting when weight is zero #2673
Fix page names that contain dot #2555
Fix RSS Title regression #2645
Handle ToC before handling shortcodes #2433
Only watch relevant themes dir #2602
Hugo new content creates TOML slices with closing bracket on new line #2800

Improvements

Add page information to error logging in rendering #2570
Deprecate RSSlink in favor of RSSLink
Make benchmark command more useful #2432
Consolidate the Param methods #2590
Allow to set cache dir in config file
Performance improvements:
Avoid repeated Viper loads of sectionPagesMenu #2728
Avoid reading from Viper for path and URL funcs #2495
Add partialCached template function. This can be a significant performance boost if you have complex partials that does not need to be rerendered for every page. #1368

217,"Hugo is going global with our 0.17 release. We put a lot of thought into how we could extend Hugo to support multilingual websites with the most simple and elegant experience. Hugo’s multilingual capabilities rival the best web and documentation software, but Hugo’s experience is unmatched. If you have a single language website, the simple Hugo experience you already love is unchanged. Adding additional languages to your website is simple and straightforward. Hugo has been completely internally rewritten to be multilingual aware with translation and internationalization features embedded throughout Hugo.
Hugo continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. @bep has made it his personal mission to apply the Go mantra of “Enable more. Do less” to Hugo. Hugo’s consistent improvement is a testament to his brilliance and his dedication to his craft. Hugo additionally benefits from the performance improvements from the Go team in the Go 1.7 release.
This release represents over 300 contributions by over 70 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 2000 stars, 50 new contributors and 20 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   12,000 stars on GitHub
-   370+ contributors
-   110+ themes  
@bep continues to lead the project with the lionshare of contributions and reviews. A special thanks to @bep and @abourget for their considerable work on multilingual support.
A big welcome to newcomers @MarkDBlackwell , @bogem and @g3wanghc for their critical contributions.
Highlights
Multilingual Support: Hugo now supports multiple languages side-by-side. A single site can now have multiple languages rendered with full support for translation and i18n.
Performance: Hugo is faster than ever! Hugo 0.17 is not only our fastest release, it’s also the most efficient. Hugo 0.17 is nearly twice as fast as Hugo 0.16 and uses about 10% less memory. This means that the same site will build in nearly half the time it took with Hugo 0.16. For the first time Hugo sites are averaging well under 1ms per rendered content.
Docs overhaul: This release really focused on improving the documentation. Gohugo.io is more accurate and complete than ever.

218,"0.16.0 June 6th 2016
Hugo 0.16 is our best and biggest release ever. The Hugo community has outdone itself with continued performance improvements, beautiful themes for all types of sites from project sites to documentation to blogs to portfolios, and increased stability.
This release represents over 550 contributions by over 110 contributors to the main Hugo codebase. Since last release Hugo has gained 3500 stars, 90 contributors and 23 additional themes.
This release celebrates 3 years since @spf13 wrote the first lines of Hugo. During those 3 years Hugo has accomplished some major milestones including…
-   10,000+ stars on GitHub
-   320+ contributors
-   90+ themes
-   1000s of happy websites
-   Many subprojects like @spf13/cobra , @spf13/viper and @spf13/afero which have experienced broad usage across the Go ecosystem.
@bep led the development of Hugo for the 3rd consecutive release with nearly half of the contributions to 0.16 in addition to his considerable contributions as lead maintainer. @anthonyfok , @DigitalCraftsman , @MooreReason all made significant contributions. A special thanks to @abourget for his considerable work on multilingual support. Due to its broad impact we wanted to spend more time testing it and it will be included in Hugo’s next release.
Highlights
Partial Builds: Prior to this release Hugo would always reread and rebuild the entire site. This release introduces support for reactive site building while watching (hugo server). Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes and only re-read the changed files. Depending on the files change Hugo will intelligently re-render only the needed portion of the site. Performance gains depend on the operation performed and size of the site. In our testing build times decreased anywhere from 10% to 99%.
Template Improvements: Template improvements continue to be a mainstay of each Hugo release. Hugo 0.16 adds support for the new block keyword introduced in Go 1.6 – think base templates with default sections – as well as many new template functions.
Polish: As Hugo matures releases will inevitably contain fewer huge new features. This release represents hundreds of small improvements across ever facet of Hugo which will make for a much better experience for all of our users. Worth mentioning here is the curious bug where live reloading didn’t work in some editors on OS X, including the popular TextMate 2. This is now fixed. Oh, and now any error will exit with an error code, a big thing for automated deployments.

.deb packages for Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
Hugo has become part of the official Debian and Ubuntu repositories since January 2016!
Check out the following download links in Debian and Ubuntu:
- Debian: https://packages.debian.org/sid/hugo
- Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/hugo (awaiting sync from Debian as of 2016-06-12)
And, if you are already running the latest cutting-edge version of Debian or Ubuntu, simply run apt-get install hugo to get it!   :smile:
Or download the .deb files provided below (amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64, ppc64el are currently available, hopefully more coming soon).  For Raspberry Pi users running Raspbian and alike, the file you want is hugo_0.16-1_armhf.deb.
_Note: The .deb file sizes are smaller than other alternative downloads because the /usr/bin/hugo contained therein were stripped of debug symbols as per Debian policy.
RPM package for Fedora (and Mandriva, openSUSE, etc.)
@jdoss has kindly uploaded and built the Hugo .rpm packages to the Fedora Copr.1  Please visit https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/spf13/Hugo/ to get them.
Alternatively, you may download hugo-0.16-2.el6.x86_64.rpm below (fetched from https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/spf13/Hugo/epel-6-x86_64/00341389-hugo/hugo-0.16-2.el6.x86_64.rpm) which should work on all flavors of RPM-based distributions running on x86_64 (amd64).

1. Copr, pronounced like ""copper"", means ""Cool Other Package Repositories"" according to the Fedora Copr FAQ.","0.16.0 June 6th 2016
Hugo 0.16 is our best and biggest release ever. The Hugo community has outdone itself with continued performance improvements, beautiful themes for all types of sites from project sites to documentation to blogs to portfolios, and increased stability.
This release represents over 550 contributions by over 110 contributors to the main Hugo codebase. Since last release Hugo has gained 3500 stars, 90 contributors and 23 additional themes.
This release celebrates 3 years since @spf13 wrote the first lines of Hugo. During those 3 years Hugo has accomplished some major milestones including…
-   10,000+ stars on GitHub
-   320+ contributors
-   90+ themes
-   1000s of happy websites
-   Many subprojects like @spf13/cobra , @spf13/viper and @spf13/afero which have experienced broad usage across the Go ecosystem.
@bep led the development of Hugo for the 3rd consecutive release with nearly half of the contributions to 0.16 in addition to his considerable contributions as lead maintainer. @anthonyfok , @DigitalCraftsman , @MooreReason all made significant contributions. A special thanks to @abourget for his considerable work on multilingual support. Due to its broad impact we wanted to spend more time testing it and it will be included in Hugo’s next release.
Highlights
Partial Builds: Prior to this release Hugo would always reread and rebuild the entire site. This release introduces support for reactive site building while watching (hugo server). Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes and only re-read the changed files. Depending on the files change Hugo will intelligently re-render only the needed portion of the site. Performance gains depend on the operation performed and size of the site. In our testing build times decreased anywhere from 10% to 99%.
Template Improvements: Template improvements continue to be a mainstay of each Hugo release. Hugo 0.16 adds support for the new block keyword introduced in Go 1.6 – think base templates with default sections – as well as many new template functions.
Polish: As Hugo matures releases will inevitably contain fewer huge new features. This release represents hundreds of small improvements across ever facet of Hugo which will make for a much better experience for all of our users. Worth mentioning here is the curious bug where live reloading didn’t work in some editors on OS X, including the popular TextMate 2. This is now fixed. Oh, and now any error will exit with an error code, a big thing for automated deployments.

219,"The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our many users to contribute.  This release represents over 377 contributions by 87 contributors to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a new theme showcase and participated in Hacktoberfest.
Hugo now has:
- 6700 (+2700) stars on GitHub
- 235 (+75) contributors
- 65 (+30) themes
Template Improvements: This release takes Hugo to a new level of speed and usability. Considerable work has been done adding features and performance to the template system which now has full support of Ace, Amber and Go Templates.
Hugo Import: Have a Jekyll site, but dreaming of porting it to Hugo? This release introduces a new hugo import jekyllcommand that makes this easier than ever.
Performance Improvements: Just when you thought Hugo couldn't get any faster, Hugo continues to improve in speed while adding features. Notably Hugo 0.15 introduces the ability to render and serve directly from memory resulting in 30%+ lower render times.
Huge thanks to all who participated in this release. A special thanks to @bep who led the development of Hugo this release again, @anthonyfok, @eparis, @tatsushid and @DigitalCraftsman.
New features

new hugo import jekyll command. #1469
The new Param convenience method on Page and Node can be used to get the most specific parameter value for a given key. #1462
Several new information elements have been added to Page and Node:
RuneCount: The number of runes in the content, excluding any whitespace. This may be a good alternative to .WordCount  for Japanese and other CJK languages where a word-split by spaces makes no sense.  #1266
RawContent: Raw Markdown as a string. One use case may be of embedding remarkjs.com slides.
IsHome: tells the truth about whether you're on the home page or not.

Improvements

hugo server now builds ~30%+ faster by rendering to memory instead of disk. To get the old behavior, start the server with --renderToDisk=true.
Hugo now supports dynamic reloading of the config file when watching.
We now use a custom-built LazyFileReader for reading file contents, which means we don't read media files in /content into memory anymore -- and file reading is now performed in parallel on multicore PCs. #1181
Hugo is now built with Go 1.5 which, among many other improvements, have fixed the last known data race in Hugo. #917
Paginator now also supports page groups. #1274
Markdown improvements:
Hugo now supports GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting for md-files (Blackfriday rendered markdown) and mmark files (MMark rendered markdown). #362 #1258
Several new Blackfriday options are added:
Option to disable Blackfriday's Smartypants.
Option for Blackfriday to open links in a new window/tab. #1220
Option to disable Blackfriday's LaTeX style dashes #1231
Definition lists extension support.


Scratch now has built-in map support.
We now fall back to link title for the default page sort. #1299
Some notable new configuration options:
IgnoreFiles can be set with a list of Regular Expressions that matches files to be ignored during build. #1189
PreserveTaxonomyNames, when set to true, will preserve what you type as the taxonomy name both in the folders created and the taxonomy key, but it will be normalized for the URL.  #1180
hugo gen can now generate man files, bash auto complete and markdown documentation
Hugo will now make suggestions when a command is mistyped
Shortcodes now have a boolean .IsNamedParams property. #1597

New Template Features

All template engines:
The new dict function that could be used to pass maps into a template. #1463
The new pluralize and singularize template funcs.
The new base64Decode and base64Encode template funcs.
The sort template func now accepts field/key chaining arguments and pointer values. #1330
Several fixes for slicestr and substr, most importantly, they now have full utf-8-support. #1190 #1333 #1347
The new last template function allows the user to select the last N items of a slice. #1148
The new after func allows the user to select the items after the Nth item. #1200

It is now possible to use constructs like where Values "".Param.key"" nil to filter pages that doesn't have a particular parameter. #1232
getJSON/getCSV: Add retry on invalid content. #1166
The new readDir func lists local files. #1204
The new safeJS function allows the embedding of content into JavaScript contexts in Go templates.
Get the main site RSS link from any page by accessing the .Site.RSSLink property. #1566
Ace templates:
Base templates now also works in themes. #1215.
And now also on Windows. #1178
Full support for Amber templates including all template functions.
A built-in template for Google Analytics. #1505
Hugo is now shipped with new built-in shortcodes: #1576
youtube for YouTube videos
vimeo for Vimeo videos
gist for GitHub gists
tweet for Twitter Tweets
speakerdeck for Speakerdeck slides

Bugfixes

Fix data races in page sorting and page reversal. These operations are now also cached. #1293
page.HasMenuCurrent() and node.HasMenuCurrent() now work correctly in multi-level nested menus.
Support Fish and Chips style section titles. Previously, this would end up as  Fish And Chips. Now, the first character is made toupper, but the rest are preserved as-is. #1176
Hugo now removes superfluous p-tags around shortcodes. #1148

Notices

hugo server will watch by default now.
Some fields and methods were deprecated in 0.14. These are now removed, so the error message isn't as friendly if you still use the old values. So please change:
getJson to getJSON, getCsv to getCSV, safeHtml to
    safeHTML, safeCss to safeCSS, safeUrl to safeURL, Url to URL,
    UrlPath to URLPath, BaseUrl to BaseURL, Recent to Pages.

Known Issues
Using the Hugo v0.15 32-bit Windows or ARM binary, running hugo server would crash or hang due to a memory alignment issue in Afero.  The bug was discovered shortly after the v0.15.0 release and has since been fixed by @tpng.  If you encounter this bug, you may either compile Hugo v0.16-DEV from source, or use the following solution/workaround:
- 64-bit Windows users: Please use hugo_0.15_windows_amd64.zip (amd64 == x86-64).  It is only the 32-bit hugo_0.15_windows_386.zip that crashes/hangs (see #1621 and #1628).
- 32-bit Windows and ARM users: Please run hugo server --renderToDisk as a workaround until Hugo v0.16 is released (see “hugo server” returns runtime error on armhf and #1716).","The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo.

220,"The v0.14.0 Hugo release brings of the most demanded features to Hugo. The foundation of Hugo is stabilizing nicely and a lot of polish has been added. We’ve expanded support for additional content types with support for AsciiDoc, Restructured Text, HTML and Markdown. Some of these types depend on external libraries as there does not currently exist native support in Go. We’ve tried to make the experience as seamless as possible. Look for more improvements here in upcoming releases.
A lot of work has been done to improve the user experience, with extra polish to the Windows experience. Hugo errors are more helpful overall and Hugo now can detect if it’s being run in Windows Explorer and provide additional instructions to run it via the command prompt.
The Hugo community continues to grow. Hugo has over 4000 stars on github, 165 contributors, 35 themes and 1000s of happy users. It is now the 5th most popular static site generator (by Stars) and has the 3rd largest contributor community.
This release represents over 240 contributions by 36 contributors to the main Hugo codebase.
Big shout out to @bep who led the development of Hugo this release, @anthonyfok, @eparis, @SchumacherFM, @RickCogley & @mdhender for their significant contributions and @tatsushid for his continuous improvements to the templates. Also a big thanks to all the theme creators. 11 new themes have been added since last release and the hugoThemes repo now has previews of all of them.
Hugo also depends on a lot of other great projects. A big thanks to all of our dependencies inclding:
cobra, viper, blackfriday, pflag, HugoThemes, BurntSushi/Toml, goYaml, and the Go standard library.
New features

Support for all file types in content directory. 
If dedicated file type handler isn’t found it will be copied to the destination.
Add AsciiDoc support using external helpers.
Add experimental support for Mmark markdown processor 
Bash autocomplete support via genautocomplete command
Add section menu support for a Section Menu for ""the Lazy Blogger""
Add support for Ace base templates
Adding RelativeURLs = true to site config will now make all the relative URLs relative to the content root.
New template functions:
getenv
The string functions substr and slicestr
    *seq, a sequence generator very similar to its Gnu countepart
absURL and relURL, both of which takes the BaseURL setting into account

Improvements

Highlighting with Pygments is now cached to disk -- expect a major speed boost if you use it! 
More Pygments highlighting options, including line numbers
Show help information to Windows users who try to double click on hugo.exe.
Add bind flag to hugo server to set the interface to which the server will bind
Add support for canonifyurls in srcset
Add shortcode support for HTML (content) files
Allow the same shortcode to  be used with or without inline content
Configurable RSS output filename

Bugfixes

Fix panic with paginator and zero pages in result set.
Fix crossrefs on Windows.
Fix eq and ne template functions when used with a raw number combined with the result of add, sub etc. 
Fix paginator with uglyurls
Fix #998, supporting UTF8 characters in Permalinks.

Notices

To get variable and function names in line with the rest of the Go community,   a set of variable and function names has been deprecated: These will still  work in 0.14, but will be removed in 0.15. What to do should be obvious by  the build log; getJson to getJSON, getCsv to getCSV, safeHtml to   safeHTML, safeCss to safeCSS, safeUrl to safeURL, Url to URL,  UrlPath to URLPath, BaseUrl to BaseURL, Recent to Pages,  Indexes to Taxonomies.

221,"The v0.13.0 release is the largest Hugo release to date. The release introduced
some long sought after features (pagination, sequencing, data loading, tons of
template improvements) as well as major internal improvements. In addition to
the code changes, the Hugo community has grown significantly and now has over
3000 stars on github, 134 contributors, 24 themes and 1000s of happy users.
This release represents 448 contributions by 65 contributors
A special shout out to @bep and
@anthonyfok for their new role as Hugo
maintainers and their tremendous contributions this release.
New major features

Support for data files in YAML,
  JSON, or TOML
  located in the data directory (#885)
Support for dynamic content by loading JSON & CSV
  from remote sources via GetJson and GetCsv in short codes or other layout
  files (#748)
Pagination support for home page, sections and
  taxonomies (#750)
Universal sequencing support
A new, generic Next/Prev functionality is added to all lists of pages
    (sections, taxonomies, etc.)
Add in-section Next/Prev content pointers
Scratch -- a ""scratchpad"" for your node- and page-scoped
  variables
Cross Reference support to easily link documents
  together with the ref and relref shortcodes. 
Ace template engine support (#541)
A new shortcode token of {{<!--* */-->}} (raw HTML)
  alongside the existing {{%/* */%}} (Markdown)
A top level Hugo variable (on Page & Node) is added with various build
  information
Several new ways to order and group content:
ByPublishDate
GroupByPublishDate(format, order)
GroupByParam(key, order)
GroupByParamDate(key, format, order)
Hugo has undergone a major refactoring, with a new handler system and a
  generic file system. This sounds and is technical, but will pave the way for
  new features and make Hugo even speedier

Notable enhancements to existing features

The shortcode handling is rewritten for speed and
  better error messages. 
Several improvements to the template functions:
where is now even more powerful and accepts SQL-like syntax with the
    operators ==, eq; !=, <>, ne; >=, ge; >, gt; <=,
    le; <, lt; in, not in
where template function now also accepts dot chaining key argument
    (e.g. ""Params.foo.bar"")
New template functions:
apply
chomp
delimit
sort
markdownify
in and intersect 
trim
replace
dateFormat
Several configurable improvements related to Markdown
  rendering:
Configuration of footnote rendering
Optional support for smart angled quotes, e.g. ""Hugo"" → «Hugo»
Enable descriptive header IDs
URLs in XML output is now correctly canonified (#725, #728, and part
  of #789)

Other improvements

Internal change to use byte buffer pool significantly lowering memory usage
  and providing measurable performance improvements overall
Changes to docs:
A new Troubleshooting section is added
It's now searchable through Google Custom Search (#753)
Some new great tutorials:
Automated deployments with
  Wercker
Creating a new theme


hugo new now copies the content in addition to the front matter
Improved unit test coverage
Fixed a lot of Windows-related path issues
Improved error messages for template and rendering errors
Enabled soft LiveReload of CSS and images (#490)
Various fixes in RSS feed generation (#789)
HasMenuCurrent and IsMenuCurrent is now supported on Nodes
A bunch of bug fixes
