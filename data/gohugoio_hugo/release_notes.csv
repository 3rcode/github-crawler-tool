4,"Hugo module is the second Hugo release of the year. Note: There's already a link.
Notable news
Page Fragments
We added the new module method on module as part of the Related Content feature refresh (below), but it's plenty useful on its own, and has been long sought after by Hugo users.
It has many uses: Build table of contents, check if a page fragment (heading identifier) exists on a page, check for duplicate heading identifiers, start table of contents from a specific heading identifier. See the link for more information
Indexing of Page Fragments in Related Content
We have reworked the Related Content API so it's now one method module that takes either a module or an options map. We have also introduced a new module attribute on the index configuration with the new type module. See link for details, but to add some weight to the page titles in the Related Content configuration you can do this:
module
See the link for more.
Global page func
Note: There was a bug in this release that made this new feature not working, so you need to upgrade to link. We blame it on link.
Hugo almost always passes a module as the data context into the top level template (e.g. module) (the one exception is the multihost sitemap template). This means that you can access the current page with the module variable in the template.
But when you're deeply nested inside module, partial etc., accessing that module object isn't always practical or possible.
For this reason, Hugo now provides a global module function that you can use to access the current page from anywhere in any template.
module
Notes

For the Goldmark markdown hander, we now split parse and render for Goldmark. This was motivated by the new fragments support in Related Content, but it has some other side effects: If you only need a page's table of contents, we now skip the rendering step, which makes it faster, but it also means that you can access the page module structure from everywhere, even in render hooks  (271318ad @bep #10750)

Hugo module is the last release of 2022 – and with that we're wishing all of you a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year[^1].
Notable new features
Pass variables to SCSS/SASS
Hugo has had great SCSS/SASS support, but passing variables (e.g. theme colours from config) down to the transpiler has been much harder than it should.
In Hugo module we added a new link and you can finally just do:
module
And then in the SCSS file:
```scss
@use ""hugo:vars"" as v;
p {
    color: v.$color1;
    font-size: v.$font-size;
}
```
More examples link.
Hugo Module Workspaces
Workspace support was added in link, and in this release Hugo finally gets solid support for it.
A common use case for a workspace is to simplify local development of a site with its theme modules.
A workspace can be configured in a module file and activated with the link setting, which for this use is commonly controlled via the module OS environment variable.
See the link file in the Hugo Docs repo for an example:
```
go 1.19
use .
use ../gohugoioTheme
```
Using the module directive, list all the modules you want to work on, pointing to its relative location. As in the example above, it's recommended to always include the main project (the ""."") in the list.
With that you can start the Hugo server with that workspace enabled:
module
The module flag is added above to ignore any of the vendored dependencies inside module. If you don't use vendoring, you don't need that flag. But now the server is set up watching the files and directories in the workspace and you can see your local edits reloaded.
Breadcrumbs
We have added a new module method on module that walks up the tree to the home page. With this, breadcrumbs templates can be greatly simplified:
```handlebars


    {{- range .Ancestors.Reverse }}
      link
    {{- end }}
    
link



```
The path to /public now available in PostCSS
So you can do  module in your module to figure out where Hugo publishes
its files.
Note that the value will always be an absolute file path and will point to a directory on disk even when running module in memory mode.
If you write to this folder from PostCSS when running the server, you could run the server with one of these flags:
module
Note

modules: Make the module.workspace=off as default (note) 0d4b17d4 @bep #10553

Bug fixes

If you use the legacy module transpiler in module and uses the cached build to avoid having the extended version installed on the CI server, you need to rebuild those assets and commit them to source control (e.g. with module).

7,"With Hugo module you can render standalone Markdown images without a surrounding paragraph. Both the HTML- and CommonMark-specification defines image as an inline element. For Markdown, this has meant that if you put an image on its own (not inlined in another paragraph), it would be wrapped in module tags, even if you provide your own link.
Now you can get by this annoyance by setting module
module
In the above we have also enabled attribute support for Markdown blocks to illustrate another nice side effect of this; it's now possible to use Markdown attributes (e.g. CSS classes) on standalone images:
```md
This is an inline image: image. Some more text.
image
{.blue}
```
The images in the above Markdown example would, given the hook template below, be rendered wrapped in a module element with the module CSS class applied in the latter example.
module
Two new fields are added to the render context passed to image render hooks:

module: Returns true if this is a standalone image and the config option link is disabled.
module: Zero-based ordinal for all the images in the current document.

14,"Some bug fixes, dependency upgrades and a new module link. This method returns a slice of the most dominant colors in an image. The library we use is implemented by @marekm4 and is both fast and accurate. One use case for this may be to use as a placeholder before the image is loaded, as seen on this link link. You need a slow enough internet connection to notice this effect so you may want to try this with Chrome's dev console open and throttle the network to slow 3G, which would make it look something like this:

"
16,"There are 3 main topics in this release:

The module finally comes with proper link.
You can now use module'ed resources in all file types (e.g. JSON), not just HTML.
We have standardised the archive names for the release archives (as you can see further below). Hugo has since the first version used a rather odd and non-standard mixed case naming of the archive files (e.g. module). We now use the standard GOOS/GOARCH values as-is, which makes it easier for people to script against. To avoid breakage when running on Netlify and similar, we create aliases for the most commonly downloaded Linux-archives on the old format and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.

20,"Note: there were an issue with the Deb Linux binaries (see #10220), so those are now removed; will create a patch release with a fresh set later today.
This release adds Linux ARM64 extended archives (see issue #8257). If you look behind the scenes of this, you may say that ""this looks like a lot of work for one file"", but the current serial build setup was already closing in on the timeout limits of CircleCI (mostly because of the relatively resource-intensive extended build with CGO/webp/libsass). So, we eventually had to do something. This release is built using link, a custom build tool that allows us to link. The Linux ARM64 binaries are built in its own Docker container, and we also get a general speedup of the entire build:

In Circle CI, this is how the release flow looks like:

In the above, module is doing most of the work and is configured with module and partitioned using module  and module:

Notes

The MacOS archives have been replaced with universal/fat binaries that works on all MacOS platforms, named *macOS-universal.tar.gz.
These archives are removed: 32 bit Linux archives, Windows 32-bit and ARM, Linux ARM Deb. We may re-add some of these if enough people shout.

23,Fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file 212d9e30 @bep #9959 
24,"module (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.100.0.
Indentation fixes for shortcode blocks: We now record the indentation before the opening shortcode tag when parsing the source. This allow us to fix a couple of annoying issues in Hugo:

We have added a new module method to the shortcode context to prevent the module shortcode from including in the indentation as part of the code block. See  #4717.
Hugo now preserves the indentation for shortcode blocks. See more below.

A shortcode block is when the shortcode is included as the first non-whitespace content on a line. Note that this does not touch shortcodes with inner content, where the user is in control of the indentation. See issue #9946 for more information. An example, say that I have this in module:
module
And then use that shortcode in a content file:
module
In earlier versions of Hugo the above would render as:
image
Now it renders as:
image
Note that in the example above we use the module file suffix for the shortcode. In this release we also added module as a built-in output format in Hugo, defined as a plain text format, meaning you get more lenient parsing compared to HTML. Using this if your shortcode produces Markdown has fewer quirks. See #9821.
Also noteworthy is the new template function link which allows you to copy almost any Hugo module (the one exception is the module), possibly most useful for renaming things:
module

Notes

The methods on Page module and module now returns true for itself, which is obviously the correct behaviour. We have fixed this before, but reverted it because it broke some theme's logic. Looking back, that reversion was a mistake. If you want the old logic you can get that by doing somethiong ala module #9925
We have removed Blackfriday as a Markdown option. It has been deprecated for a long time, its v1 version is not maintained anymore, and there are many known issues. Goldmark should be a mature replacement by now. #9944

25,Fix server regression for multihost sites (multiple languages with different baseURLs) 2f9eac48 @bep #9901 
26,"The theme of this release is error handling – a topic grievously underrated in most development tools. You are often expected to Google this mysterious error and end up in some Stackoverflow thread telling you to use a specific Node version. Hugo has done an OK job in this department, but when I, @bep, recently got stuck with a minify error I had no clue how to debug, I knew we had to take another look at this. There is a list of ""error improvements below"",  but here is one visual example:
image
The two screenshots above is from the same template error in Hugo module (left) and the new module (right). This is a type error (method not found) in a partial included in a shortcode template. We did a decent job in module, too, pointing at correct line in the partial. But the right version has the full stack, with absolute filename, line and column and some file context (highlighted lines) for all of the files involved in the error (Markdown file, shortcode and partial). Having these source file references to click on in the VS Code terminal is a real time saver, especially in Hugo projects with mulitiple file roots (themes, theme components).
A list of the most important ""error improvements"":

A new server error template (can be overridden in module), always add the content file context if relevant, improve JS errors, Add file context (with position) to codeblock render blocks, add file context to errors in the publishing step (e.g. minify), and more.  #9892 #9891 #9893
Fix SIGINT handling (allowing to kill the server) after loading bad configuration #9664
Improve SASS/SCSS errors (both Dart SASS and Libsass) #9897
Fix line numbers in errors from PostCSS, add missing file context to ""import not found"" #9895

Also worth mentioning is the new module cli flag (#8787 ) which allows you to ""set the clock"" and see how your site looks like ... in the future.

28,"The module release has been an Easter riddle. The new module flag required a consolidation of the file systems in Hugo, which introduced a bug. The fix for that bug introduced a new bug, and reverting the obvious pick of the two candidate commits ... did not resolve the issue.
OK, all good things are three, and now with proper tests to avoid this particular issue happening again.

The new text sorting algorithm means among other things that text with accents in them gets ordered the way you would expect. Before this release:

This release also re-introduces the new server flag module, which enables a  new hybrid static filesystem for Hugo's development server. This is great for sites with lots of static content, as it greatly reduces memory consumption while still keeping the fast render times by writing dynamic content to memory (the definition of static content in Hugo is all files mounted in module and all files in module that's not content files or a member of a content bundle). With this update, there are now 3 filesystem options when starting the server:

module (default), renders to and serves all files from memory.
module, renders to and serves all files from disk.
module (the new hybrid mode), renders to and serves static files from disk, dynamic files from memory.

One final improvement to mention would be the new module option in module, which, is set, will be used as the cache key. The default behaviour is to calculate the key based on the URL and all the options. This means that you can now do:

32,"Vertical merging of content mounts. The main topic of this release is about file mounts (see #9693). We have had a powerful and well defined merge strategy for the union filesystems for the Hugo Modules tree on the horizontal axis (left to right), but not so much for the vertical configuration within each module (e.g. multiple content mounts for the same language). It was @jmooring who link how useful this could be, and even provided this example where missing translations gets filled in from other language(s):
```toml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content mounts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EN content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'en'
DE content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/de'
target = 'content'
lang = 'de'
NL content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/nl'
target = 'content'
lang = 'nl'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fill in the missing translations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This fills in the gaps in DE content with EN content
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'de'
This fills in the gaps in NL content with EN content.
[[module.mounts]]
source = 'content/en'
target = 'content'
lang = 'nl'
```
Also, we have added some details to the module object you get when module fails, which can be useful when debugging errrors (see #9708). Not you can do something like:
module
The module object above is a module and currently contains module, module, module, module, module, and module.

33,"Even faster, continue and break support, short-circuit of the built-in and/or-operators. This release upgrades to Go 1.18 which was released yesterday. This has made Hugo even faster. How much faster will depend on your site etc., but we have link that show significant improvements. But the main reason we're exited about this is the improvements in Go templates:
There are two new keywords, link. These behaves like you would expect coming from other programming languages:
module
module
Also, the two built-in operators/function module and module now link, also in line with how module and module behave in other programming languages. This is useful in situations where the right side may have side effects (may be module, is slow to execute etc.):

36,"Up to 20% reduction in build time and memory usage. That is the sales pitch for this release. In reality it depends (e.g. on how big and complex your site is), but we have link and real site tests that show impressive improvements. It was @quasilyte (see #9386) who tipped us about this potential. He had tested it with the link website with about 20% speedup. 
Post Release Update: Hugo users are link of more than 50%.
Continuing on the performance theme, @satotake has implemented a new hybrid static filesystem for Hugo's development server, which is great for sites with lots of static content, as it greatly reduces memory consumption while still keeping the fast render times by writing dynamic content to memory (the definition of static content in Hugo is all files mounted in module and all files in module that's not content files or a member of a content bundle). With this update, there are now 3 filesystem options when starting the server:

module (default), renders to and serves all files from memory.
module, renders to and serves all files from disk.
module (the new hybrid mode), renders to and serves static files from disk, dynamic files from memory.

A final note goes to the new module option in the link (see #9639). The module extension is enabled by default. It turns module and similar into clickable links. But before this release, the default protocol used was module. This is in line with the CommonMark spec, but that doesn't make much sense in 2022, so now you get module as the default.

40,"Markdown diagrams and code block render hooks. Now it's possible create custom templates for Markdown code blocks, either for all or just for specific programming languages. This can also be used to render diagrams from Markdown code blocks. We provide GoAT (Go ASCII Tool) natively from Hugo, but you can also add your own template to get link support. The implementation of GoAT is a Go implementation by @blampe of link' diagrams. See the link for details.
This means that you can write diagrams as text directly into diagrams, so this:

43,"Hugo module is mostly a release to prepare for some cool stuff coming in the next releases. Most notable are the deprecation updates:

The module methods marked as deprecated in Hugo 0.55 are now removed. They have been logged as an module for a long time now and you will still get a clear error if you use them.
The support for module as a Markdown engine is removed. That has been marked as deprecated for a long time, and the upstream library is also deprecated and unmaintained.
If you use module on a module that is backed by a file, you will now get a warning. More on that below.

The module method on module works like before. But that method currently has a little vague specification – it behaves a little different if backed by a file. In Hugo module we're going to introduce a canonical content path, and to prepare for that change, you may see this in your log:
```bash
WARN 2022/01/12 10:23:37 .Path when the page is backed by a file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We plan to use Path for a canonical source path and you probably want to check the source is a file. To get the current behaviour, you can use a construct simlar to the below:
{{ $path := """" }}
  {{ with .File }}
    {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ else }}
    {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ end }}
Re-run Hugo with the flag --panicOnWarning to get a better error message.
```
module is commonly used to create links to the source on GitHub – and that obviously only works for files, so you, as suggested above, may want to check if it's a file first.
Note that the module flag is a new flag in this release and works for all warnings – it will fail fast on the first warning and point to the line in question. This makes it much easier to pin-point the location.
But this release isn't all about technical upgrades. We have also added a new module template function. We have already a way to list the Hugo Modules dependencies from the command line (module), but we thought it would be useful to also record this into your rendered site. An example of a ""dependency table"" in HTML may look like this:
```htmlbars
Dependencies



#
Owner
Path
Version
Time
Vendor



    {{ range $i, $e := hugo.Deps }}
    
{{ add $i 1 }}
{{ with .Owner }}{{.Path }}{{ end }}

        {{ .Path }}
        {{ with .Replace}}
        => {{ .Path }}
        {{ end }}
        
{{ .Version }}
{{ with .Time }}{{ . }}{{ end }}
{{ .Vendor }}

    {{ end }}
    

```

Notes
This release contains some changes that may break your build:
Use resources.GetRemote to fetch remote resources
In Hugo 0.90 we added remote support to module. In hindsight it was not a great idea use the same method for both, as a poll from many Hugo users showed. See Issue #9285 for more details. This release introduces module which you need to use for remote resources. The example we showed in the release notes for module will now look like:
```htmlbars
{{ $font := resources.GetRemote ""https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/apache/roboto/static/Roboto-Black.ttf"" }}
{{ $img := resources.GetRemote ""https://gohugo.io/images/gohugoio-card-1.png"" }}
{{ $img = $img | images.Filter (images.Text 
                        ""Rocks!!!"" 
                        (dict 
                            ""color"" ""#E6B405"" 
                            ""size"" 100
                            ""lineSpacing"" 8 
                            ""x"" 400 ""y"" 320
                            ""font"" $font))
}}
```
If you want to fetch any resource not having to consider where it lives, you can use a construct similar to the below:
module
New Security Configuration
This release also adds some new security hardening measures for the Hugo build runtime in the form of a new module configuration. There are some rarely used features in Hugo that would be good to have disabled by default. One example would be the ""external helpers"".
For module and some others we use Go's module package to start a new process. These are a predefined set of binary names, all loaded from module and with a predefined set of arguments. Still, if you don't use module in your project, you might as well have it turned off.
You can configure this in the new module configuration section. The defaults are configured to create a minimal amount of site breakage, but if that do happen, you will get clear instructions in the console about what to do.
The default configuration is listed below. Note that almost all of these options are regular expression whitelists (a string or a slice); the value module will block all.
```toml
[security]
  enableInlineShortcodes = false
  [security.exec]
    allow = ['^dart-sass-embedded$', '^go$', '^npx$', '^postcss$']
    osEnv = ['(?i)^(PATH|PATHEXT|APPDATA|TMP|TEMP|TERM)$']
[security.funcs]
    getenv = ['^HUGO_']
[security.http]
    methods = ['(?i)GET|POST']
    urls = ['.*']
```

"
47,"This release contains some fixes and improvements related to error handling in remote lookups in module, as introduced in Hugo 0.90.0:

Now we will always return module (never fail the build) when a resource is not found, also for remote resources (HTTP status code 404). This means that you can do module and similar constructs, not having to consider where the resource source lives.
Fetching resources remotely over HTTPS has a much greater chance of failing (network down, server down) than reading a file from disk (if not already link). And having this lead to a failing build is not always optimal. This release allows you to handle/ignore these errors in the templates if needed, see details below.

The return value from module now includes an module method that will be set if the call failed. If you want to just log any error as a module you can use a construct similar to the one below.
module
Note that if you do not handle module yourself, Hugo will fail the build the first time you start using the failed module object.

48,"Hugo 0.90 finally brings remote support to module, XML support (in module and module), and a new module filter. A special shoutout and thanks to link for his work on these features.
The support for remote module in module has been a feature in great demand. This means that you can fetch remote files (images, JSON files, RSS feeds ...) and use them in link functions as they were local. A contrived example may look like this:
```htmlbars
{{ $font := resources.Get ""https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/apache/roboto/static/Roboto-Black.ttf"" }}
{{ $img := resources.Get ""https://gohugo.io/images/gohugoio-card-1.png"" }}

                        ""Rocks!""

53,"This release is a dependency refresh (the new Goldmark version comes with a lot of bug fixes, as one example), many bug fixes, but also some nice new features:
We have added the link includeFiles and excludeFiles to the mount configuration. This allows fine grained control over what files to include, and it works for all of Hugo's file systems (including module).
We have also link. The old implementation had some issues, mostly related to the context (e.g. name, file paths) passed to the template. This new implementation is using the exact same code path for evaluating the pages as in a regular build. This also makes it more robust and easier to reason about in a multilingual setup. Now, if you are explicit about the target path, Hugo will now always pick the correct mount and language:

Notes

Hugo now writes an empty file named module to the root of the project when building (also when doing module and other commands that requires a build). We recommend you just leave this file alone. Put it in module or similar if you don't want the file in your source repository.
We have updated to ESBuild module. The release notes for link mentions a potential breaking change.
We now only build AMD64 release binaries (see link) for the Unix OSes (e.g. NetBSD). If you need, say, a binary for ARM64, you need to build it yourself.
We now build only one release binary/archive for MacOS (see link) that works on both Intel and the new Arm M1 systems.
module now returns the owning directory name for all bundles (branch an leaf). This is a bug fix, but worth mentioning. See link.
We have updated the Twitter shortcode to use Twitter's new API. See link for details.

"
55,"Note: There's some missing ARM64 binaries for MacOS, see #8952
The most important piece in this release is the Go 1.17 update. This release is built with that new Go version, but also and more importantly, the Hugo Modules logic has been updated to support Go's new way of (lazy) loading transitive dependencies. If you already have Go 1.17 installed, building existing Hugo Modules backed projects have not been an issue, but module for a new project could give you too new versions of transitive dependencies. Hugo 0.88 fixes this.

Notes

We have fixed a bug with the import order in module for the case module when both module and module exists. This is in line with how both Node and ESBuild's native import resolver does it. We discovered this trying to build AlpineJS v3 from source mounted in module. See link link link.

57,"This is a bug-fix release with one important fix.

config: Fix a potential deadlock in config reading link link link
"
58,"This is release is a set of smaller fixes and improvements. Some of the more noteable:
You can now have a top level link (or one per language, if needed) section in your site configuration (e.g. module). This way you can control default front matter values from outside of the content files.
Hugo's link works good, but hasn't been particulary easy to set the active menu state for section pages without a menu defintion. We have had the option link. That helped for the common case, but we have now made it behave more sensible out of the box: module will now always return true for any descendant of that section. To support this for menu defintions in the site config, we have added a new module option on link:
```toml
[[menus.main]]
pageRef = ""blog""
When pageRef is set, setting module is optional; it will be used as a fallback if the page is not found.
url = ""/blog""
```
Set module to a value that link understands, and the menu entry will be correctly connected to the page.

"
59,"Hugo module is on the smaller side of releases, but the main new thing it brings should be important to those who need it: Poll based watching for file system changes.
Hugo uses link to provide native file system notifications. This is still the default, but there may situations where this isn't working. The file may not support it (e.g. NFS), or you get the ""too many open files"" error and cannot or do not want to increase the module. Enable polling by passing the module flag with an interval:

You van even do ""long polling"" by passing a long interval:

"
64,"This release brings several configuration fixes and improvements that will be especially useful for themes.
Deep merge of theme Params
One of the most common complaint from Hugo theme owners/users has been about the configuration handling. Hugo has up until now only performed a shallow merge of theme module into the configuration.
With that, given this example from a theme configuration:
module
If you would like to use the above theme, but want a different shade of red, you earlier had to copy the entire block, even the colours you're totally happy with. This was painful even the simplest setup.
Now you can just override the module keys you want to change, e.g.:
module
For more information, and especially about the way you can opt out of the above behaviour, see link.
Themes now support the config directory
Now both the project and themes/modules can store its configuration in both the top level config file (e.g. module) or in the module directory. See link.
HTTP headers in getJSON/getCSV
module now supports custom HTTP headers. This has been a big limitation in Hugo, especially considering the link header.
We have updated the internal Instagram shortcode to pass the access token in a header:
module
Also see the discussion link about the access token above.
New erroridf template func
Sometime, especially when creating themes, it is useful to be able to let the user decide if an error situation is critical enough to fail the build. The new module produces module log statements that can be toggled off:
module
Will log:
module

71,"Hugo depends on Go's module for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system module on Windows. However, if a malicious file with the same name (module or module) was found in the current working directory at the time of running module, the malicious command would be invoked instead of the system one.
Windows users who ran module inside untrusted Hugo sites was affected.
The origin of this issue comes from Go, see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736

75,"This release finally brings full link support to link, curtsy of the new plugin API in the really, really fast link by link.
Some notes on the improvements in this release:

Now module fully supports the virtual union file system in link. Any import inside your JavaScript components will resolve starting from the top component mount inside module with a fallback to the traditional ""JS way"" (module etc.)
You can now pass configuration data from the templates to your scripts via a new module option.
Hugo now writes a module file inside module (you can turn it off) with import mappings to help editors such as VS Code with intellisense/navigation, which is especially useful when there is no common root and the source lives inside some temporary directory.
We have also improved the build errors you get from module. In server mode you will get a preview of the failing lines and in the console you will get a link to the location.

Read more about this in link, but a short usage example would look like:
In the template:
module
And then in a JavaScript component:
```js
import * as params from '@params';
// Wil resolve to one of module inside module.
import { hello } from 'my/module/hello';
var api = params.api;
hello();
```

76,"Hugo module is a small, but useful release. Some notable updates are:

time.AsTime accepts an optional location as second parameter, allowing timezone aware printing of dates.
You can now build with module if you don't need the module feature.
Remote module errors can now be ignored by adding module to your site config.

There are also several useful link enhancements:

We have added module to the link. This should enable a much simpler developer workflow, simpler to set up preview sites for your remote theme etc, as you now can do module and similar.
The module module for local modules can now be absolute for imports defined in the project.

A related improvement is that the link module is now an enum. In addition to turning on/off rendering of a given page you can tell Hugo to not render, but you want to preserve the module, useful for SPA applications.

"
84,"Hugo module brings several improvements to Hugo Modules, a new CLI command to bridge the JavaScript dependencies into Hugo, a refresh of the versions of the most important upstream dependencies, and more.
NPM Pack
The new CLI command is called module.  We have marked it as experimental. It works great, go ahead and use it, but we need to test this out in real projects to get a feel of it; it is likely that it will change/improve in the upcoming versions of Hugo. The command creates a consolidated module from the project and all of its link. On version conflicts, the version closest to the project is selected. We may revise that strategy in the future (link maybe?), but this should give both control and the least amount of surprise for the site owner.
So, why did we do this? JavaScript is often a background actor in a Hugo project, and it doesn't make sense to publish it to a NPM registry. The JS dependencies are mostly build tools (PostCSS, TailwindCSS, Babel), module. This has been working fine as long as you kept the JS config files (including module) in the project, adding duplication/work when using ready-to-use theme components. These tools work best when you have everything below a single file tree, which is very much different to how link work. An example of a module with TailwindCSS:
module
If you included module in a Hugo project and processed it with module, this is what happened in earlier versions:

It used the directory where the module lives as a starting point to look  for any module'd dependency.
TailwindCSS would, on the other hand, load its configuration file relative to where module was invoked (the project directory).

The above just doesn't work and here is the technical notes on how we have fixed this:

The new module creates a consolidated module based on files named module it finds in the dependency tree (one is created for you the first time you run this command). The end result will always be module, which works seamlessly with module invoked automatically by Netlify and other CI vendors.
The main project's module folder is added to link when running moduleand module.
We have introduced a new mount point module where we, by default, mount the JS configuration files that we're interested in. This is where Hugo will start looking for these files, and the files' filenames will also be available in the Node environment, so you can do:

module
Module Enhancements

We have added a module Glob pattern config to the module config link link link. This allows you to only vendor a subset of your dependencies.
We have added module option to module imports config link link link, which allows you to import a module and load its config, but not follow its imports.
We have deprecated module in favour of a module, a patch matching Glob pattern link link. A typical use for this would be when you have vendored your dependencies, but want to edit one of them.

Statistics
This release represents 79 contributions by 19 contributors to the main Hugo code base. link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to link for his relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to link, link and link for all the great work on the documentation site.

Hugo now has:

352+ link

Notes

We now build with Go 1.15, which means that we no longer build release binaries for MacOS 32-bit.
You may now get an error message about ""error calling partial: partials that returns a value needs a non-zero argument."". This error situation was not caught earlier, and comes from a limitation in Go's templates: If you use the module keyword in a partial, the argument you pass to that partial (e.g. the ""."") cannot be zero (and 0 and """" is considered a zero argument).

This release comes with native JavaScript bundling (and minifier), with link support (from module etc.), tree shaking, scope hoisting for ES6 modules, transpilation of JSX and newer JS syntax down to ES6, JavaScript/JSX and TypeScript/TSX support. And it's very fast. link rates it at least 100x faster than the other JavaScript bundlers included. This new feature is backed by the very impressive link project by link. Many thanks to link for the integration work.

89,"Again, a release on the small side. Some new features -- one example is that we now support hook templates per section/type, see link -- and some important bug fixes.
But the most important part of this release is that we have now finally cleaned up the terms used for the taxonomy page kinds. This has made the taxonomy feature in Hugo harder to understand than it needed to be. The old/new values for these are module => module and module => module. We have taken great care to avoid site breakage. See link for more information.

96,"It's Easter, a time for mysteries and puzzles. And at first glance, this Hugo release looks a little mysterious. The core of it is a mind-twister:
module
The above uses the new link template function which tells Hugo to postpone the transformation of the Hugo Pipes chain to after the build, allowing the build steps to use the build output in module as part of its processing.
The prime current use case for the above is CSS pruning in PostCSS. In simple cases you can use the templates as a base for the content filters, but that has its limitations and can be very hard to setup, especially in themed configurations. So we have added a new link configuration that, when enabled, will write a file named module to your project root with some aggregated data about the build, e.g. list of HTML entities published, to be used to do link.

107,"Hugo 0.65 generalizes how a page is packaged and published to be applicable to any page. This should solve some of the most common issues we see people ask and talk about on the link and on the link.
Release Highlights
New in Hugo Core
Any link can now bundle resources (images, data files etc.), even the taxonomy nodes (e.g. /categories).
List pages (sections and the home page) can now be added to taxonomies.
The front matter fields that control when and if to publish a piece of content (module, module, module) now also works for list pages, and is recursive.
We have added a new module front matter keyword to provide fine-grained control over page publishing. The default values:
module
Note that all front matter keywords can be set in the link on a branch node, which would be especially useful for module.
We have also upgraded to the latest LibSass (v3.6.3). Nothing remarkable functional new here, but it makes Hugo ready for the upcoming link.
And finally, we have added a module method on module, making  listing the terms defined on this page in the given taxonomy much simpler:
```go-html-template

    {{ range (.GetTerms ""tags"") }}
        link
   {{ end }}

```
New in Hugo Modules
There are several improvements to the tooling used in link. One bug fix, but also some improvements to make it easier to manage:

You can now recursively update your modules with module
module will now only clean the cache for the current project and now also takes an optional module path pattern, e.g. module
A new command module is added to verify that the module cache matches the hashes in module. Run with module to delete any modules that fail this check.

See link.
Performance
The new features listed above required a structural simplification, and we do watch our weight when doing this. And the benchmarks show that Hugo should, in general, be slightly faster. This is especially true if you're using taxonomies, and the partial rebuilding on content changes should be considerably faster.
Numbers
This release represents 34 contributions by 6 contributors to the main Hugo code base.link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions.

Notes

module (the Page method) will now only do relative lookups, which is what most people would expect.

And when we needed to simplify the template handling code to solve a concurrency issue, it also became more effective. And as a bonus, we also finally got the link that you really, really wanted!

Hugo now has:

41091+ link
440+ link
286+ link

Notes

module on-page now returns an empty string if not set in the front matter or if module returns empty. See link.
Baseof template (e.g. module) lookup order is completely revised/expanded. See link. We now do template resolution at execution time following the same rules as the template it applies to (e.g. module). This is an obvious improvement and your site should work as before.
Shortcode params now supports params with raw string literals (strings surrounded with ``) that supports newlines.
Note: In a base template (e.g. baseof.html), the first template block must be a define.

113,"The main driving force behind these patch releases in the new year has been getting a good story with link between GitHub and Hugo, using the new render hooks introduced in link. And all was mostly well until a Hugo user asked about anchor links. Which is, when you look into it, a slightly sad Markdown story. They have been link over at the CommonMark forum for the last six years, but it has come to nothing. The current situation is that some Markdown engines support the module attribute syntax (Hugo's Goldmark does, GitHub does not) and for those that support auto-generation of IDs, the implementation often varies. And this makes for poor portability.
To improve this, Hugo has now reverse-engineered GitHub's implementation and made that the default strategy for generation or header IDs. We understand that this isn't everyone's cup of tea, so you can link to be one of module, module (some client-libraries have Unicode issues) or module (which will match how it behaved before Hugo 0.60).

115,"From all of us to all of you, a very Merry Christmas -- and Hugo module! This version brings link. This gives you full control over how links and images in Markdown are rendered without using any shortcodes. With this, you can get Markdown links that work on both GitHub and Hugo, resize images etc. It is a very long sought after feature, that has been hard to tackle until we got link, the new Markdown engine, by link. When you read up on this new feature in the documentation, also note the new link method on module.
Adding these render hooks also had the nice side effect of making Hugo faster and more memory effective. We could have just added this feature on top of what we got, getting it to work. But you like Hugo's fast builds, you love instant browser-refreshes on change. So we had to take a step back and redesign how we detect ""what changed?"" for templates referenced from content files, either directly or indirectly. And by doing that we greatly simplified how we handle all the templates. Which accidentally makes this version  the fastest to date. It's not an ""every site will be much faster"" statement. This depends. Sites with many languages and/or many templates will benefit more from this. We have benchmarks with site-building showing about 15% improvement in build speed and memory efficiency.
This release represents 25 contributions by 5 contributors to the main Hugo code base. link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions. And a big thanks to link and link for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to link for his great work on the documentation site.

Hugo now has:

40362+ link
440+ link
284+ link

Notes

Ace and Amber support is now removed from Hugo. See link for more information.
The module template function does not, yet, support render hooks. We recommend you look at the new and more powerful link method on module.
If you have output format specific behaviour in a template used from a content file, you must create a output format specific template, e.g. module. This also applies to the new rendering hooks introduced in this release. This has been the intended behaviour all the time, but a failing test (now fixed) shows that the implementation of this has not been as strict as specified, hence this note.
The module does not return any value anymore. This means that the ERROR will just be printed to the console. We have also added a module template func.

118,"link by link is now the new default library used for Markdown in Hugo. It's CommonMark compliant and  GitHub flavored, and both fast and flexible. Blackfriday, the old default, has served us well, but there have been formatting and portability issues that were hard to work around. The ""CommonMark compliant"" part is the main selling feature of Goldmark, but with that you also get attribute syntax on headers and code blocks (for code blocks you can turn on/off line numbers and highlight line ranges), strikethrough support and an improved and configurable implementation of module. See link for an overview of extensions.
Please read the link and the updated documentation. We suggest you start with link. Goldmark is better, but the feature set is not fully comparable and it may be more stricter in some areas (there are 17 rules for how a link should look like); if you have any problems you cannot work around, see link for a way to change the default Markdown handler.
Also, if you have lots of inline HTML in your Markdown files, you may have to enable the module mode:

317+ link

Notes

module now behaves like all the other sections, see link. If you want to list all the regular pages, use module.
We have added some new image filters to Hugo's image processing. This also means that we have consolidated the resize operations to use the one module library (from the same developer as the one we used before). The operations work as before, but one difference is that we no longer embed ey color profile information in PNG images, but this should also be a more portable solution. Software that supports color profiles will assume that images without an embedded profile are in the sRGB profile. Software that doesn't support color profiles will use the monitor's profile, which is most likely to be sRGB as well.
We have improved the file cache logic for processed images and only stores them once when the same image is bundled in multiple languages. This means that you may want to run module to clean your image cache.

125,"Hugo 0.57.0 had some well-intended breaking changes. And while they made a lot of sense, one of them made a little too much noise.
This release reverts the behavior for module on the home page to how it behaved in 0.56, but adds a module telling you what to do to prepare for Hugo 0.58.
In short, module home will from 0.58  only return its immediate children (sections and regular pages).
In this release it returns module. So to prepare for Hugo 0.58 you can either use module in your home template, or if you have a general module or RSS template, you can do something like this:
module

tpl: Use RegularPages for RSS template link link link
hugolib: Don't use the global warning logger link link link
tpl: Avoid ""home page warning"" in RSS template link link link
hugolib: Allow index.md inside bundles link link link

"
127,"Hugo 0.57 brings Cascading Front Matter, Alphabetical Sorting, Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards. And more.
Cascading Front Matter: We have added a new and powerful module keyword to Hugo's front matter. This can be added to any index node in module. Any values in module will be merged into itself and all the descendants.
module
It's worth noting that the module element itself will also be merged. Also, to grasp the full value of this feature, remember that front matter in Hugo is both data and behaviour: You can tell Hugo how to process a subset of the pages (some example keywords are module, module, module, module) using the module keyword, e.g. ""I want this subsection to be rendered in both the module and module Output Formats"".
This feature is created bylink and link See link for details.
Resources Loading from Assets with Wildcards: We have added two new sought after template functions to the module namespace: module and module. These behaves like their namesake methods on module (with link), but searches in all the resources in Assets. E.g. module will give a slice of all ""pretty pictures"". Another relevant example: module.
Performance: In general, this version is slightly faster and more memory effective. In particular, we have fixed a performance issue with the replacer step that greatly improves the build speed of certain large and content-rich sites (thanks to link for the fix).  
This release represents 46 contributions by 8 contributors to the main Hugo code base.link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions.

Notes

All string sorting in Hugo is now alphabetical/lexicographical.
module now only returns pages in the top level section. Before this release, it included all regular pages in the site. This made it easy to list all the pages on home page, but it also meant that you needed to take special care if you wanted to navigate the page tree from top to bottom. If you need all regular pages, use module.  Also see link.
module now include sections. We have added module as a convenience method if you want the old behaviour. See link for details.
Hugo now only ""auto create"" sections for the home page and the top level folders. The other sections need a module file. See link for details.

"
131,"Hugo 0.56.0 is filled with improvements, but there are two main headliners: Hugo Modules and Hugo Deploy.  
Hugo Deploy is implemented by link and brings built-in deployment support for GCS, S3, or Azure using the Hugo CLI. See the link for more information.
Hugo Modules is very much a community effort on the design and specification side, but link has driven the implementation. Some notes about what all of this is about:

A new module configuration section where you can import almost anything. You can configure both your own file mounts and the file mounts of the modules you import. This is the new recommended way of configuring what you earlier put in module, module etc. And it also allows you to mount folders in non-Hugo-projects, e.g. the module folder in the Bootstrap GitHub project.
A module consists of a set of mounts to the standard 7 component types in Hugo: module, module, module, module, module, module, and module. Yes, Theme Components can now include content, which should be very useful, especially in bigger multilingual projects.
Modules not in your local file cache will be downloaded automatically and even ""hot replaced"" while the server is running.
Hugo Modules supports and encourages semver versioned modules, and uses the minimal version selection algorithm to resolve versions.
A new set of CLI commands are provided to manage all of this: module,  module,  module,  module, and  module.

Hugo Modules is powered by Go Modules.
This is all very much brand new and there are only a few example projects around:

https://github.com/bep/docuapi is a theme that has been ported to Hugo Modules while testing this feature. It is a good example of a non-Hugo-project mounted into Hugo's folder structure. It even shows a JS Bundler implementation in regular Go templates.
https://github.com/bep/my-modular-site is a very simple site used for testing.

See the link for more information.
This release represents 104 contributions by 19 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to link and link for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to link for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in link, 
which has received 48 contributions by 37 contributors. A special thanks to link, link, link, and link for their work on the documentation site.

Notes

We  have removed the ""auto theme namespacing"" of  params from theme configuration. This was an undocumented and hidden feature that wasn't useful in practice.

We have revised and improved the symlinks support in Hugo: In earlier versions, symlinks were only fully supported for the content folders. With the introduction of the new very flexible file mounts, with content support even for what we have traditionally named ""themes"", we needed a more precise definition of symlink support in Hugo:


Symlinks are not supported outside of the main project ((the project you run module or module from).

In the main project module mounts, only symlinks to files are supported.
In all other mounts in the main project, both file and directory symlinks are allowed.

138,"Hugo module is the early Easter Egg Edition with lots of great improvements and fixes. The original motivation for this release was to prepare for link, but the structural changes needed for that paved the way for lots of others. Please study the list of changes below, and especially the Notes section, but some headlines include:
Virtualized Output Formats
link has been a really useful feature, but it has had some annoying and not so obvious restrictions that are now lifted. Now all module collections are aware of the output format being rendered. This means, to give some examples, that:

In a module template, listing pages with their content will use output format specific shortcode templates even if the pages themselves are not configured to output to that output format.
Using module when looping over a module collection will now work as expected.
Every Output Format can be paginated.

We have now also added a new module configuration attribute, which is enabled by default for module and module.
Shortcodes Revised
Shortcodes using the module as the outer-most delimiter will now be fully rendered when sent to the content renderer (e.g. Blackfriday for Markdown), meaning they can be part of the generated table of contents, footnotes, etc.
If you want the old behavior, you can put the following line in the start of your shortcode template:
module
But using the module delimiter will, in most cases, be a better alternative, possibly in combination with the module template func.
See link.
New Return Keyword for Partials
Hugo's module and module are great for template macros. With the new module keyword you can write partials as proper functions that can return any type:
module
See link.
.Page on Taxonomy nodes
The taxonomy nodes now have a module accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper module etc. This means that older and clumsy constructs can be simplified. Some examples:
```go-html-template

    {{ range .Data.Terms.Alphabetical }}
            link {{ .Count }}
    {{ end }}

```
```go-html-template

    {{ range .Site.Taxonomies.tags }}
            link {{ .Count }}
    {{ end }}

```
See link.
And it's Faster!
This version is also the fastest to date. A site building benchmark shows more than 10% decrease in both build time and memory consumption, but that depends on the site. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously improve performance. Also, note that we are now more honest about build times reported (module). We now do all initialization in the module step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have module enabled, which now is included in the reported time.

Notes

module as the outer-most shortcode delimiter means ""pass the inner content to the content renderer"" (e.g. Blackfriday);  the old behavior can be had, see  link
moduleconfiguration option is removed. Use module.
We no longer limit the number of pages passed to the module Output Format. We have moved that limit to the internal module template, and you can do so yourself using the module in your custom template.
We no longer add XML headers to Output Formats that output XML (module). This header is moved to the templates. If you have custom RSS or sitemap templates you may want to add the XML declaration to these. Since they, by default, is handled by Go's HTML template package, you must do something like this to make sure it's preserved: module
More honest build times reported (module). We now do all initialization in the module step, so you may get a higher time reported if you, as an example, have module enabled, which now is included in the reported time.
The taxonomy nodes now have a module accessor which makes it much simpler to get a proper module etc. see link.
The template keywords module and module now work properly for zero and interface types, see link
Taxonomy terms lists (module of module module) without any date(s) set (e.g. from front matter) will now pick the latest dates from the child pages. This is in line with how other branch nodes work in Hugo.
A new configuration option, module, is added to Output Format and enabled that by default for module and module types. See  link 
module is removed. If you want to really understand the latency in your project in Hugo, try the new module flag and pass that file to the many tools that read link. There are also some newly hidden flags in module, module, module, hidden because they are considered to be only of interest to developers.
Chroma is updated with many fixes and new lexers, see link
We now support module-relative aliases, e.g. aliases that do not start with a module, see link
We now support context-relative (language) URLs in front matter, meaning that in most cases module can be replaced with the more portable module. See link

"
140,"From all of us to all of you, a very Merry Christmas -- and Hugo module!
The main new features in this release are:

You can now split your configuration into directories per environment. Hugo did support multiple configuration files before this release, but it was hard to manage for bigger sites, especially those with multiple languages. With this we have also formalized the concept of an module; the defaults are module (when running module) or module (when running module) but you can create any environment you like.  We will update the documentation, but all the details are in link. Also, see link for how the refactored configuration for the Hugo website looks like.
module (see the link is a new and powerful template function that can turn module objects or strings with JSON, TOML, YAML or CSV into maps/arrays.
Two new global variables in module and module. module gives you version info etc. (module, module), but the module is probably more useful, as it allows you to access the current link (e.g. module) without any context (or ""."").

This version is also the fastest to date. A site building benchmark shows around 10% faster, but that depends on the site. The important part here is that we're not getting slower.  It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously improve performance. It's like not gaining weight during Christmas. We also had a small performance boost in version module. A user then reported that his big and complicated site had a 30% reduction in build time. This is important to us, one of the core features. It's in the slogan: ""The world’s fastest framework for building websites.""

141,"The two big new items in this release is link and link. In Hugo we really care about build speed, and caching is important. With this release, you get much better control over your cache configuration, which is especially useful when building on a Continous Integration server (Netlify, CircleCI or similar). Inline Shortcodes was implemented to help the Bootstrap project link to Hugo. Note that this feature is disabled by default. To enable, set module in your site config. Worth mentioning is also the new module shortcode, which looks up the param in page front matter with the site's parameter as a fall back.

143,"Hugo module brings greatly improved error messages, and we now also show them in the browser. Having error messages with filename, line- and column number greatly simplify troubleshooting. Many editors (like VS Code) even let you click and navigate directly to the problematic line. If your editor requires a different log format, you can set it via the module OS environment variable:
module
But this release isn't all about error handling. Getting line- and column number into ""every"" error also meant that we had to consolidate and simplify some code paths, which, as a nice side effect, made Hugo a little bit faster. Benchmarks show it running about 5% faster and consume about 8% less memory.
Also, we have now implemented ""render on demand"" in Hugo's Fast Render Mode (default when running module). This means that you should now always see updated content when navigating around the site after a change.
This release represents 88 contributions by 14 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
link leads the Hugo development with a significant amount of contributions, but also a big shoutout to link, link, and link for their ongoing contributions.
And a big thanks to link and link for their relentless work on keeping the themes site in pristine condition and to link for his great work on the documentation site.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in link, 
which has received 14 contributions by 9 contributors. A special thanks to link, link, link, and link for their work on the documentation site.

146,"Hugo module brings link and also improves the language handling in module. This should simplify working with link. One example of this would be how you now can create a link for the Hugo web site.
But this release is also about collections. Go 1.11 gave us variable overwrite support in Go templates. That made it possible to simplify a lot of template constructs, but it also showed some limitations in Hugo's template functions. So with this release we have:

added link function to append to collections.
added link to create custom page groups.
improved the type support in link.

147,"Hugo module is built with the brand new Go 1.11. On the technical side this means that Hugo now uses link for the build. The big new functional thing in Go 1.11 for Hugo is added support for link. This means that you can now do:

150,"Hugo 0.46 is the closing credits to The Summer of Hugo. While most people have been relaxing on the beach, Hugo has been really busy: 

0.42, June 12, 2018: link
0.43, July 9, 2018: link

This was followed by some more technical follow-up releases. And today, when July has turned into August, we come with another one. It's not a big release. But with the big interest in Hugo Pipes, we felt that it was important to get this out there sooner rather than later.
There are two main items in this release:

We have added a custom SCSS/SASS import resolver that respects Hugo's project/themes filesystem hierarchy anywhere in module. Using the LibSass' resolver alone only made this work for the entry folder.
Resources fetched via module and similar are now language agnostic. The thought behind the original implementation was maximum flexibility with support for module per language. In practice, this was a bad idea, as it made some CSS imports hard to get working in multilingual setups, and you got duplication of identical content for no good reason, with added processing time.

This release represents 12 contributions by 2 contributors to the main Hugo code base.
A special thanks in this release goes to link for his excellent work maintaining the fast-growing link.
Many have also been busy writing and fixing the documentation in link, 
which has received 5 contributions by 3 contributors.
Hugo now has:

27596+ link
442+ link
245+ link

Notes

Resources fetched via module and similar are now considered global across languages. If you need, as an example, to create a CSS per language, you need to set the path yourself.

Enhancements

Add module template function. This can be used to check if a template, e.g. a partial, exists in the project or any of the themes in use. link link link
Remove superflous loop link link 
Update Chroma link link link
Make resources fetched via module and similar language agnostic link link link

152,"Hugo module is the revival of ref, relref and GetPage. link and link have done some great work improving the API and implementation for the helper functions used to get one page. Before this release, the API was a little bit clumsy and the result potentially ambiguous in some situations.
Now you can simply do:
module
Or to get a section page:
module
We have also added a module method on module and added support for page-relative linking. This means that the leading slash (module) now has a meaning. For module, all lookups will start at the content root. But for lookups with a module context, paths without a leading slash will be treated as relative to the page.
This means that the following example will find the page in the current section:
module
You can also use the module to refer to a page one level up etc.:
module
We have now also added language support to module and module, so you can link to a page in another language:
module
To link to a given Output Format of a document, you can use this syntax:
module
To make working with these reflinks on bigger sites easier to work with, we have also improved the error logging, and added two new configuration settings:

refLinksErrorLevel: ERROR (default, will fail the build when a reflink cannot be resolved) or WARNING.
refLinksNotFoundURL: Set this to an URL placeholder used when no reference could be resolved.

Visit the link for more information.
We have also done some important improvements and fixes in Hugo Pipes in this release: SCSS source maps on Windows now works, we now support project-local module installation, and we have added module to module options, making it possible to include, say, a path below module in the SASS/SCSS build.

153,"Hugo module is the follow-up release, or The Sequel, of the very well received module only days ago. That release added Hugo Pipes, with SCSS/SASS support, assets bundling and minification, ad-hoc image processing and much more.
This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it also includes several important improvements.
Many complained that their SVG images vanished when browsed from the module. With Hugo Pipes MIME types suddenly got really important, but Hugo's use of module was ambiguous. This became visible when we redefined the module to work with Hugo Pipes. We have now added a module field on the MIME type definition in Hugo, which is a list of one or more filename suffixes the MIME type is identified with. If you need to add a custom MIME type definition, this means that you also need to specify the full MIME type as the key, e.g. module.

Hugo module adds a powerful and very simple to use Assets Pipeline with SASS and SCSS with source map support, PostCSS and minification and fingerprinting and Subresource Integrity and ... much more. Oh, did we mention that you can now do ad-hoc image processing and execute text resources as Go templates?
An example pipeline:
module
To me, the above is beautiful in its speed and simplicity. It could be printed on a t-shirt. I wrote in the link some days ago about the value of a single binary with native and fast implementations. I should have added simplicity as a keyword. There seem to be a misconception that all of this needs to be hard and painful.
New functions to create module objects:

module
module: Create a Resource from a string.

New module transformation funcs:

module: Compile module or module into module.
module: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option).
module: Currently supports module, module, module, module, module, module.
module: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.
module: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler.
module: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template.

Brew, Snap builds etc. will come. But note that you only need the extended version if you want to edit SCSS. For your CI server, or if you don't use SCSS, you will most likely want the non-extended version.

Notes

The module shortcode is removed. It didn't work properly, so is isn't expected to be in wide use. If you use it, you will get a build error. You will either have to remove its usage or add a module shortcode to your own project or theme.
We have now virtualized the filesystems for project and theme files. This makes everything simpler, faster and more powerful. But it also means that template lookups on the form module will not work anymore. That syntax has never been documented, so it's not expected to be in wide use. module will give you the most specific version of that partial.

162,"Hugo module is The Revival of the Shortcodes. Shortcodes is one of the prime features in Hugo. Really useful, but it has had some known shortcomings. link has been really busy the last week to address those.
In summary:

module for a page retrieved in a query in a shortcode is now almost always available. Note that shortcodes can include content that can include shortcodes that can include content... It is possible to bite your tail. See more below.
Shortcodes are now processed and rendered in their order of appearance.
Related to the above, we have now added a zero-based module to the shortcode.

The first bullet above resolves some surprising behaviour when reading other pages' content from shortcodes. Before this release, that behaviour was undefined. Note that this has never been an issue from regular templates.
It will still not be possible to get the current shortcode's  page's rendered content. That would have impressed Einstein.
The new and well defined rules are:

module from a shortcode will be empty. The related module module, module, module, module and module will also have empty values.
For other pages (retrieved via module, module etc.) the module is there to use as you please as long as you don't have infinite content recursion in your shortcode/content setup. See below.
module is good to go (but does not support shortcodes in headlines; this is unchanged)

If you get into a situation of infinite recursion, the module will be empty. Run module for more information.

Oscar Peterson called it ""Nat's stabilizers"". This release is the software equivalent of that. We have been doing frequent main releases this year, but looking back, the patch releases that followed them seemed unneeded. And looking at the regressions, most of them stem from the module package, a package that before this release was filled with globals and high coupling. This package is now rewritten and accompanied with decent test coverage.
But this release isn't all boring and technical: It includes several important bug fixes, several useful new template functions, and module allows you to get any resource's content without having to fiddle with file paths and module.

We have added two simple methods on the module object:

module finds every resource matching a pattern. Examples: module finds every JPEG image in module and module finds every JPEG image in the bundle.
module finds the first resource matching the pattern given.

Note: The path separators used are Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows.
It uses link with the addition of the module, aka super-asterisk, which matches across path boundaries.

Today is New Year's Eve. It is the last day of 2017, a year that have seen a string of pearls of Hugo releases, making Hugo the top choice for website development:

0.32, December 2017: Page Bundles and Image Processing edition.
0.31, November 2017: The Language Multihost Edition! with one module per language.
0.30, October 2017: The Race Car Edition with the Fast Render Mode.
0.29, September 2017: Added Template Metrics.
0.28, September 2017:  Blistering fast and native syntax highlighting from link.
0.27, September 2017: Fast and flexible Related Content.
0.26, August 2017: The Language Style Edition  with AP Style or Chicago Style Title Case and « French Guillemets ».
0.25, July 2017: The Kinder Surprise edition added, among other cool things, module which navigates to the content page you start editing.
0.24, June 2017: Was The Revival of the Archetypes! Now archetype files, i.e. the content file templates, can include template syntax with all of Hugo's functions and variables.
0.23, June 2017: Hugo moved to it's own GitHub organization, gohugoio.
0.22, June 2017: Added nested sections, a long sought after feature.
0.21, May 2017: Full support for shortcodes per output format (think AMP).
0.20, April 2017: Was all about Custom Output Formats.
0.19, February 2017: Native Emacs Org-mode content support and lots of internal upgrades.

Notes

The build total in the console is now the ... total (i.e. it now includes both the copy of the static files and the Hugo build). So if your Hugo site seems to build slightly slower, it is in reality probably slightly faster than before this release.
Images and other static resources in folders with ""_index.md"" will have its module relative to its page.
Images and other static resources in or below ""index.md"" folders will have its module relative to its page (respecting permalink settings etc.)

imageThe Multihost feature  is sponsored by link, link's company.

link means that you can have a module per language, for example, module and module. This is seamlessly integrated, and the built-in web server with live reload and module etc. just works. A related enhancement in this release is the support for as many static dirs as you need, with intelligent language overrides, forming a big union file system. Add to that several other language related fixes and enhancements, it is safe to say that this is the version you want for multilingual Hugo sites!

It is hard to explain, so start the Hugo development server with module and start editing. Live reloads just got so much faster! The ""how and what"" is discussed at length in link, but the short version is that we now re-render only the parts of the site that you are working on.
The second performance-related feature is a follow-up to the Template Metrics added in Hugo module. Now, if you add the flag module, we will calculate a score for how your partials can be cached (with the module template func).
This release also more or less makes the really fast Chroma highlighter a complete alternative to Pygments. Most noteable is the new table module support (link link link), which makes copy-and-paste code blocks much easier.

Hugo now handles the archetype files as Go templates. This means that the issues with sorting and lost comments are long gone. This also means that you will have to supply all values, including title and date. But this also opens up a lot of new windows.

```markdown
title: ""{{ replace .TranslationBaseName ""-"" "" "" | title }}""
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true

Insert Lead paragraph here.

Note: the site will only be built if the module is in use in the archetype file, and this can be time consuming for big sites.

Hugo module adds support for plain text partials included into module templates. This was a side-effect of the big new link feature in module, and while the change was intentional and there was an ongoing discussion about fixing it in link, it did break some themes. There were valid workarounds for these themes, but we might as well get it right.
The most obvious use case for this is inline module styles, which you now can do without having to name your partials with a module suffix.
A simple example:
In module:
module
Then in module (note that by using the module lookup func, we can override the color in a page’s front matter if we want):
module
And then in module (or the partial used to include the head section into your layout):
module
Of course, module also made it super-easy to create external module stylesheets based on your site and page configuration. A simple example:
Add “CSS” to your home page’s module list, create the template module using Go template syntax for the dynamic parts, and then include it into your module template with:

Hugo module introduces the powerful and long sought after feature link; Hugo isn’t just that “static HTML with an added RSS feed” anymore. Say hello to calendars, e-book formats, Google AMP, and JSON search indexes, to name a few ( link ).
This release represents over 180 contributions by over 30 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 1100 stars, 20 new contributors and 5 additional themes.
Hugo now has:

16300+ stars
495+ contributors
156+ themes

link still leads the Hugo development with his witty Norwegian humor, and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to link for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and link and link for their ongoing contributions.
Other Highlights
link has also contributed TOML as an alternative and much simpler format for language/i18n files (link). A feature you will appreciate when you start to work on larger translations.
Also, there have been some important updates in the Emacs Org-mode handling: link has fixed the newline-handling ( link ) and link has added basic footnote support.
Worth mentioning is also the ongoing work that link and link is doing to re-do the link site, including a total restructuring and partial rewrite of the documentation. It is getting close to finished, and it looks fantastic!
Notes

module description in the built-in template is changed from full module to module. This is a somewhat breaking change, but is what most people expect from their RSS feeds. If you want full content, please provide your own RSS template.
The deprecated module is now removed. Use module.
module is deprecated and will be removed in a future Hugo version, replace it with an output format definition.
The deprecated module is now removed, use module.
Hugo does no longer append missing trailing slash to module set as a command line parameter, making it consistent with how it behaves from site config. link

We’re happy to announce the first release of Hugo in 2017.
This release represents over 180 contributions by over 50 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 1450 stars, 35 new contributors and 15 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   15200+ stars
-   470+ contributors
-   151+ themes
Furthermore, Hugo has its own Twitter account (link) where we share bite-sized news and themes from the Hugo community.
link leads the Hugo development and once again contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to link for the Emacs Org-mode support, link for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, link for his work on revising the module handling in Hugo, and link and link for their ongoing contributions.
Highlights
Hugo module brings native Emacs Org-mode content support ( link ), big thanks to link.
Also, a considerably amount of work have been put into cleaning up the Hugo source code, in an issue titled link. This is not immediately visible to the Hugo end user, but will speed up future development.
Hugo module was bringing full-parallel page rendering, so workarounds depending on rendering order did not work anymore, and pages with duplicate target paths (common examples would be module or module) would now conflict with the home page or the section listing.
With Hugo module, you can control this behaviour by turning off page types you do not want ( link ). In its most extreme case, if you put the below setting in your module, you will get nothing!:
module
Other New Features

Add ability to sort pages by frontmatter parameters, enabling easy custom “top 10” page lists. link
Add module template function link
Add module function, which replaces the now deprecated module link
Make RSS item limit configurable link

Enhancements

Improve generation of OpenGraph date tags link

Notes

module is now deprecated and will be removed in Hugo module if no one is stepping up to the plate and fixes and maintains this feature. link

Fixes

Fix module on sites where the default sort order is not chronological. link
Fix regression of module evaluation in manual summaries. link
Fix module regression link
Fix issue with taxonomies when only some have content page link

206,"0.18.1 December 30th 2016
Hugo 0.18.1 is a bug fix release fixing some issues introduced in Hugo 0.18:
-   Fix 32-bit binaries link
-   Fix issues with module link
-   Fix module for taxonomy pages when module link
-   Fix module and module for node pages link
-   Make template error messages more verbose link"
207,"0.18.0 December 19th 2016
Today, we’re excited to release the much-anticipated Hugo 0.18!
We’re heading towards the end of the year 2016, and we can look back on three releases and a steady growing community around the project. This release includes over 220 contributions by nearly 50 contributors to the main codebase. Since the last release, Hugo has gained 1750 stars and 27 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   13750+ stars
-   408+ contributors
-   137+ themes
link once again took the lead of Hugo and contributed a significant amount of additions. Also a big shoutout to link for his relentless work on keeping the documentation and the themes site in pristine condition, and also a big thanks to link and link for their contributions.
We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
The Hugo team
Highlights
The primary new feature in Hugo 0.18 is that every piece of content is now a module ( link ). This means that every page, including the home page, can have a content file with frontmatter. Not only is this a much simpler model to understand, it is also faster and paved the way for several important new features:
-   Enable proper titles for Nodes link
-   Sitemap.xml should include nodes, as well as pages link
-   Document homepage content workaround link
-   Allow home page to be easily authored in markdown link
-   Minimalist website with homepage as content link
Hugo again continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. Running link with link (renders to memory) shows about 60% reduction in time spent and 30% reduction in memory usage compared to Hugo 0.17.
Other New Features

Every module now has a module property. Since everything is a module now, the module is used to differentiate different kinds of pages. Possible values are module, module, module, module, and module. (Internally, we also define module, module, module, and module, but those have no practical use for end users at the moment since they are not included in any collections.)
Add a module object to module if module is set. It then also sets module for the given module to the author date provided by Git. link
Implement support for alias templates link
New template functions:
Add module function link
Add module function link
Add module template function link
Add shortcode to display Instagram images link
Add module option to disable perm sync link
Add module build mode link

Notices

module will now contain several kinds of pages, including regular pages, sections, taxonomies, and the home page. If you want a specific kind of page, you can filter it with module and module. module is a shortcut to the page collection you have been used to getting.
module is now deprecated. Use module instead. Note that in Hugo 0.17 both of them existed, so there is a fifty-fifty chance you will not have to do anything (if you use a theme, the chance is close to 0), and module will still work for two Hugo versions.

Fixes

Revise the module template lookup logic so it now better matches the behavior of regular templates, making it easier to override the master templates from the theme link
Add workaround for module template crash. Block templates are very useful, but there is a bug in Go 1.6 and 1.7 which makes the template rendering crash if you use the block template in more complex scenarios. This is fixed in the upcoming Go 1.8, but Hugo adds a temporary workaround in Hugo 0.18. link
All the module configurations are now case insensitive link link link
Make RawContent raw again link
Fix archetype title and date handling link
Fix TOML archetype parsing in module link
Fix page sorting when weight is zero link
Fix page names that contain dot link
Fix RSS Title regression link
Handle ToC before handling shortcodes link
Only watch relevant themes dir link
Hugo new content creates TOML slices with closing bracket on new line link

Improvements

Add page information to error logging in rendering link
Deprecate module in favor of module
Make benchmark command more useful link
Consolidate the module methods link
Allow to set cache dir in config file
Performance improvements:
Avoid repeated Viper loads of module link
Avoid reading from Viper for path and URL funcs link
Add module template function. This can be a significant performance boost if you have complex partials that does not need to be rerendered for every page. link

Documentation Updates

Update roadmap link
Update multilingual example link
Add a “Deployment with rsync” tutorial page link
Refactor module to use the module keyword link
"
208,"Hugo is going global with our 0.17 release. We put a lot of thought into how we could extend Hugo to support multilingual websites with the most simple and elegant experience. Hugo’s multilingual capabilities rival the best web and documentation software, but Hugo’s experience is unmatched. If you have a single language website, the simple Hugo experience you already love is unchanged. Adding additional languages to your website is simple and straightforward. Hugo has been completely internally rewritten to be multilingual aware with translation and internationalization features embedded throughout Hugo.
Hugo continues its trend of each release being faster than the last. It’s quite a challenge to consistently add significant new functionality and simultaneously dramatically improve performance. link has made it his personal mission to apply the Go mantra of “Enable more. Do less” to Hugo. Hugo’s consistent improvement is a testament to his brilliance and his dedication to his craft. Hugo additionally benefits from the performance improvements from the Go team in the Go 1.7 release.
This release represents over 300 contributions by over 70 contributors to the main Hugo code base. Since last release Hugo has gained 2000 stars, 50 new contributors and 20 additional themes.
Hugo now has:
-   12,000 stars on GitHub
-   370+ contributors
-   110+ themes  
link continues to lead the project with the lionshare of contributions and reviews. A special thanks to link and link for their considerable work on multilingual support.
A big welcome to newcomers link , link and link for their critical contributions.
Highlights
Multilingual Support: Hugo now supports multiple languages side-by-side. A single site can now have multiple languages rendered with full support for translation and i18n.
Performance: Hugo is faster than ever! Hugo 0.17 is not only our fastest release, it’s also the most efficient. Hugo 0.17 is nearly twice as fast as Hugo 0.16 and uses about 10% less memory. This means that the same site will build in nearly half the time it took with Hugo 0.16. For the first time Hugo sites are averaging well under 1ms per rendered content.
Docs overhaul: This release really focused on improving the documentation. link is more accurate and complete than ever.
Support for macOS Sierra
New Features

Multilingual support link
Allow content expiration link
New templates functions:
module function to generate query strings inside templates link

Currently still at 0.16, 0.17 pending.  Thank you for your patience!"
209,"0.16.0 June 6th 2016
Hugo 0.16 is our best and biggest release ever. The Hugo community has outdone itself with continued performance improvements, link for all types of sites from project sites to documentation to blogs to portfolios, and increased stability.
This release represents over 550 contributions by over 110 contributors to the main Hugo codebase. Since last release Hugo has gained 3500 stars, 90 contributors and 23 additional themes.
This release celebrates 3 years since link wrote the first lines of Hugo. During those 3 years Hugo has accomplished some major milestones including…
-   10,000+ stars on GitHub
-   320+ contributors
-   90+ themes
-   1000s of happy websites
-   Many subprojects like link , link and link which have experienced broad usage across the Go ecosystem.
link led the development of Hugo for the 3rd consecutive release with nearly half of the contributions to 0.16 in addition to his considerable contributions as lead maintainer. link , link , link all made significant contributions. A special thanks to link for his considerable work on multilingual support. Due to its broad impact we wanted to spend more time testing it and it will be included in Hugo’s next release.
Highlights
Partial Builds: Prior to this release Hugo would always reread and rebuild the entire site. This release introduces support for reactive site building while watching (module). Hugo will watch the filesystem for changes and only re-read the changed files. Depending on the files change Hugo will intelligently re-render only the needed portion of the site. Performance gains depend on the operation performed and size of the site. In our testing build times decreased anywhere from 10% to 99%.
Template Improvements: Template improvements continue to be a mainstay of each Hugo release. Hugo 0.16 adds support for the new module keyword introduced in Go 1.6 – think base templates with default sections – as well as many new template functions.
Polish: As Hugo matures releases will inevitably contain fewer huge new features. This release represents hundreds of small improvements across ever facet of Hugo which will make for a much better experience for all of our users. Worth mentioning here is the curious bug where live reloading didn’t work in some editors on OS X, including the popular TextMate 2. This is now fixed. Oh, and now any error will exit with an error code, a big thing for automated deployments.

210,"The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our many users to contribute.  This release represents over 377 contributions by 87 contributors to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a link and participated in link.
Hugo now has:
- 6700 (+2700) stars on GitHub
- 235 (+75) contributors
- 65 (+30) themes
Template Improvements: This release takes Hugo to a new level of speed and usability. Considerable work has been done adding features and performance to the template system which now has full support of Ace, Amber and Go Templates.
Hugo Import: Have a Jekyll site, but dreaming of porting it to Hugo? This release introduces a new modulecommand that makes this easier than ever.
Performance Improvements: Just when you thought Hugo couldn't get any faster, Hugo continues to improve in speed while adding features. Notably Hugo 0.15 introduces the ability to render and serve directly from memory resulting in 30%+ lower render times.
Huge thanks to all who participated in this release. A special thanks to link who led the development of Hugo this release again, link, link, link and link.
New features

new module command. link
The new module convenience method on module and module can be used to get the most specific parameter value for a given key. link
Several new information elements have been added to module and module:
module: The number of link in the content, excluding any whitespace. This may be a good alternative to module  for Japanese and other CJK languages where a word-split by spaces makes no sense.  link
module: Raw Markdown as a string. One use case may be of embedding remarkjs.com slides.
module: tells the truth about whether you're on the home page or not.

Improvements

module now builds ~30%+ faster by rendering to memory instead of disk. To get the old behavior, start the server with module.
Hugo now supports dynamic reloading of the config file when watching.
We now use a custom-built module for reading file contents, which means we don't read media files in module into memory anymore -- and file reading is now performed in parallel on multicore PCs. link
Hugo is now built with module which, among many other improvements, have fixed the last known data race in Hugo. link
Paginator now also supports page groups. link
Markdown improvements:
Hugo now supports GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting for module-files (Blackfriday rendered markdown) and module files (MMark rendered markdown). link link
Several new Blackfriday options are added:
Option to disable Blackfriday's module.
Option for Blackfriday to open links in a new window/tab. link
Option to disable Blackfriday's LaTeX style dashes link
Definition lists extension support.


module now has built-in module support.
We now fall back to module for the default page sort. link
Some notable new configuration options:
module can be set with a list of Regular Expressions that matches files to be ignored during build. link
module, when set to module, will preserve what you type as the taxonomy name both in the folders created and the taxonomy module, but it will be normalized for the URL.  link
module can now generate man files, bash auto complete and markdown documentation
Hugo will now make suggestions when a command is mistyped
Shortcodes now have a boolean module property. link

Bugfixes

Fix data races in page sorting and page reversal. These operations are now also cached. link
module and module now work correctly in multi-level nested menus.
Support module style section titles. Previously, this would end up as  module. Now, the first character is made toupper, but the rest are preserved as-is. link
Hugo now removes superfluous p-tags around shortcodes. link

Notices

module will watch by default now.
Some fields and methods were deprecated in module. These are now removed, so the error message isn't as friendly if you still use the old values. So please change:
module to module, module to module, module to
    module, module to module, module to module, module to module,
    module to module, module to module, module to module.

Known Issues
Using the Hugo v0.15 32-bit Windows or ARM binary, running module would crash or hang due to a link in link.  The bug was discovered shortly after the v0.15.0 release and has since been link by @tpng.  If you encounter this bug, you may either compile Hugo v0.16-DEV from source, or use the following solution/workaround:
- 64-bit Windows users: Please use link (amd64 == x86-64).  It is only the 32-bit hugo_0.15_windows_386.zip that crashes/hangs (see #1621 and #1628).
- 32-bit Windows and ARM users: Please run module as a workaround until Hugo v0.16 is released (see link and #1716)."
211,"The v0.14.0 Hugo release brings of the most demanded features to Hugo. The foundation of Hugo is stabilizing nicely and a lot of polish has been added. We’ve expanded support for additional content types with support for AsciiDoc, Restructured Text, HTML and Markdown. Some of these types depend on external libraries as there does not currently exist native support in Go. We’ve tried to make the experience as seamless as possible. Look for more improvements here in upcoming releases.
A lot of work has been done to improve the user experience, with extra polish to the Windows experience. Hugo errors are more helpful overall and Hugo now can detect if it’s being run in Windows Explorer and provide additional instructions to run it via the command prompt.
The Hugo community continues to grow. Hugo has over 4000 stars on github, 165 contributors, 35 themes and 1000s of happy users. It is now the 5th most popular static site generator (by Stars) and has the 3rd largest contributor community.
This release represents over 240 contributions by 36 contributors to the main Hugo codebase.
Big shout out to link who led the development of Hugo this release, link, link, link, link & link for their significant contributions and link for his continuous improvements to the templates. Also a big thanks to all the theme creators. 11 new themes have been added since last release and the link.
Hugo also depends on a lot of other great projects. A big thanks to all of our dependencies inclding:
link, link, link, link, link, link, link, and the Go standard library.
