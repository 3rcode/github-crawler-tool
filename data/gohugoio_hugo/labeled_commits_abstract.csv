You can do this by: Configure one or more indices with type fragments The name of those index configurations maps to an (optional) front matter slice with fragment references. This allows you to link page<->fragment and page<->page. This also will index all the fragments (heading identifiers) of the pages. It's also possible to use type fragments indices in shortcode, e.g.: {{ $related := site.RegularPages.Related .Page }} But, and this is important, you need to include the shortcode using the {{< delimiter. Not doing so will create infinite loops and timeouts. This commit also: Adds two new methods to Page: Fragments (can also be used to build ToC) and HeadingsFiltered (this is only used in Related Content with index type fragments and enableFilter set to true. Consolidates all .Related* methods into one, which takes either a Page or an options map as its only argument. Add context.Context to all of the content related Page API.

342,hubolib: Add 10k pages as a benchmark variant,0.5909207,Add benchmark for building docs site 837e084b @moorereason ,"This issue was introduced in v0.102.0. In 223bf2800488ad5d38854bbb595d789bc35ebe32 we removed the byte source from the parsed page result, which meant we had to preserve exact positioning for all elements. This introduced some new TypeIgnore tokens which we, wrongly, assumed didn't matter where we put in the result slice (they should be ignored anyway). But it seems that this broke the logic where we determine if it's positional or named params in the case where the paramater value contains escaped quoutes. This commit makes sure that these ignore tokens (the back slashes) are never sent back to the client, which is how it was before v0.102.0. This commit also fixes some lost error information in that same commit. Fixes #10236",0
343,"Revert ""Restrict the new type layout resolution to page and section kinds""",0.7025947,.Pages now include sections. We have added .RegularPages as a convenience method if you want the old behaviour. See #6154 for details.,Fixes #10230,1

346,releaser: Create a proper automated title for patch releases,0.578771,releaser: Add release notes to /docs for release of 0.89.1 b6a4ae4a @bep ,"Git:  - Set GIT_EXEC_PATH and include usr/lib/git-core so that git can find the    git-remote-https helper (needed by e.g. ""go mod download""). Go:  - Put Go in its own snap part, and use stage-snaps instead of build-snaps    so that it is included in the final snap.  - Set GOCACHE to a writable directory. (In a previous commit,    HOME is set to $SNAP_REAL_HOME which is unwritable.) Hugo:  - Patch config/security/securityConfig.go ""[security.exec] osEnv"" whitelist    (during snap build) so that external dependencies can use the required    environment variables to run properly from within the snap. Asciidoctor:  - Replace shebang line in asciidoctor so it can find the ruby executable.  - Set RUBYLIB so that Ruby can find its libraries.    Caveat/TODO: The Ruby version is hardcoded in our custom RUBYLIB. Embedded Dart Sass:  - Download from GitHub and install it, for amd64 and arm64 only. Node.js:  - Remove my incomplete include list so that npx is actually installed.  - Set npm_config_{cache,init_module,userconfig} to writable locations. Pandoc:  - Set pandoc_datadir so that Pandoc can find its data files. rst2html:  - Install python3-docutils package for rst2html, rst2html5, etc.  - Set PYTHONHOME so that Python can find its libraries. Note that asciidoctor, pandoc and rst2html are not in Hugo’s default ""[security.exec] allow"" whitelist, and the snap package does not change that default, so they still needed to be whitelisted manually in config.toml if necessary by the end user. Special thanks to Joe Mooring (@jmooring) for meticulously diagnosing the issue and providing a comprehensive test repository at link without which I would not have been able to understand and resolve the issue.

This is always a user error, but getting a stack overflow (the current stack limit in Go is 1 GB on 64-bit, 250 MB on 32-bit) error isn't very helpful. This fix will not prevent all such errors, though, but we may do better once #9570 is in place.

777,hugolib: Add some more site benchmarks,0.7916775,hugolib: Add a site benchmark 416493b5 @bep ,"When a template calls the .Translations function and a Hugo environment is using multiple output formats, a template that calls methods like .Summary and .Len on each translation will unexpectedly show empty return values for these methods. This is because each pageOutput's ContentProvider is assigned to a page.NopPage in newPageOutput. When HugoSites.render assigns pageContentOutputs to pageOutputs in pageState.shiftToOutputFormat, it reuses pageContentOutputs from other pageOutputs, leaving some pageContentOutputs as NopPages. While this approach conserves resources, sometimes it means that a template will unexpectedly call a method on a pageContentOutput that is actually a NopPage. In the case of ContentProvider methods called on translations for alternative output formats, the methods were called on NopPages. This change introduces LazyContentProvider, which performs late initialization when one of its methods is called. This way, we can reuse content in ""normal"" cases but ensure that ContentProvider methods work as expected when a pageOutput is not assigned a pageContentOutput during the initial pre-render phase.

If the format is canonical, we assign the final OutputFormat's Rel to ""canonical"" rather than using f.Rel. However, this leads to unexpected behavior for custom output formats, where a user can define a ""rel"" for a format via the config file. For example, the standard for ""humans.txt"" files requires using rel=""author"" in HTML ""link"" elements. Meanwhile, humans.txt is usually the only format used for its content. As a result, for Hugo configurations that define a humans.txt custom output format, Hugo will render ""link"" elements to content in this format with rel=""canonical,"" rather than ""author"" as required by the standard. This commit changes page.NewOutputFormat to check whether a given format is user defined and, if so, skips assigning Rel to ""canonical,"" even if isCanonical is true. Fixes #8030",1

957,releaser: Fix some of the fpm fields for deb,0.7880236,Fix some of the fpm fields for deb 3bd1d057 @anthonyfok ,"Previously, minifyTransformation.Transform suppressed the error returned by t.m.Minify. This meant that when minification returned an error, the error would not reach the user. Instead, minification would silently fail. For example, if a JavaScript file included a call to the Date constructor with: new Date(2020, 04, 02) The package that the minification library uses to parse JS files, github.com/tdewolff/parse would return an error, since ""04"" would be parsed as a legacy octal. However, the JS file would remain un-minified with no error. Fixing this is not as simple as replacing ""_"" with an ""err"" in minifyTransformation.Transform, however (though this is necessary). If we only returned this error from Transform, then hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled would fail. Instead of being a no-op, as TestResourceMinifyDisabled expects, using the ""minify"" template function with a ""disableXML=true"" config setting instead returns the error, ""minifier does not exist for mimetype."" The ""minifier does not exist"" error is returned because of the way minifiers.New works. If the user's config disables minification for a particular MIME type, minifiers.New does not add it to the resulting Client's minify.M. However, this also means that when the ""minify"" template function is executed,  a resourceAdapter's transformations still add a minification. When it comes time to call the minify.Minifier for a specific MIME type via *M.MinifyMimetype, the github.com/tdewolff/minify library throws the ""does not exist"" error for the missing MIME type. The solution was to change minifiers.New so, instead of skipping a minifier for each disabled MIME type, it adds  a NoOpMinifier, which simply copies the source to the destination without minification. This means that when the ""minify"" template function is used for a particular resource, and that resource's MIME type has minification disabled, minification is genuinely skipped, and does not result in an error. In order to add this, I've fixed a possibly unwanted interaction between minifiers.TestConfigureMinify and hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled. The latter disables minification and expects minification to be a no-op. The former disables minification and expects it to result in an error. The only reason hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled passes in the original code is that the ""does not exist"" error is suppressed. However, we shouldn't suppress minification errors, since they can leave users perplexed. I've changed the test assertion in minifiers.TestConfigureMinify to expect no errors and a no-op if minification is disabled for a particular MIME type. Fixes #8954",1

This commit improves that situation given the following rules: A single integer argument is used as plural count and passed to the i18n template as a int type with a .Count method. The latter is to preserve compability with v1. Else the plural count is either fetched from the Count/count field/method/map or from the value itself. Any data type is accepted, if it can be converted to an integer, that value is used. The above means that you can now do pass a single integer and both of the below will work: {{ . }} minutes to read {{ .Count }} minutes to read Fixes #8454 Closes #7822 See link",1

An include will resolve relatively, so you can refer easily to files in the same folder. Also asciidoctor-diagram and PlantUML rendering works now, because the created temporary files will be placed in the correct folder. This patch covers just the Ruby version of asciidoctor. The old AsciiDoc CLI EOLs in Jan 2020, so this variant is removed from code. The configuration is completely rewritten and now available in config.toml under the key [markup.asciidocext]: toml [markup.asciidocext]     extensions = [""asciidoctor-html5s"", ""asciidoctor-diagram""]     workingFolderCurrent = true     trace = true     [markup.asciidocext.attributes]         my-base-url = ""link/""         my-attribute-name = ""my value"" backends, safe-modes, and extensions are now whitelisted to the popular (ruby) extensions and valid values. the default for extensions is to not enable any, because they're all external dependencies so the build would break if the user didn't install them beforehand. the default backend is html5 because html5s is an external gem dependency. the default safe-mode is safe, explanations of the modes: link/ the config is namespaced under asciidocext_config and the parser looks at asciidocext to allow a future native Go asciidoc. uglyUrls=true option and --source flag are supported --destination flag is required Follow the updated documentation under docs/content/en/content-management/formats.md.  This patch would be a breaking change, because you need to correct all your absolute include pathes to relative paths, so using relative paths must be configured explicitly by setting workingFolderCurrent = true.",0

2036,Merge branch 'redirect' of link into rozza-redirect,0.6138686,[[redirects]],"This more or less completes the simplification of the template handling code in Hugo started in v0.62. The main motivation was to fix a long lasting issue about a crash in HTML content files  without front matter. But this commit also comes with a big functional improvement. As we now have moved the base template evaluation to the build stage we now use the same lookup rules for baseof as for list etc. type of templates. This means that in this simple example you can have a baseof template for the blog section without having to duplicate the others: layouts ├── _default │   ├── baseof.html │   ├── list.html │   └── single.html └── blog     └── baseof.html Also, when simplifying code, you often get rid of some double work, as shown in the ""site building"" benchmarks below. These benchmarks looks suspiciously good, but I have repeated the below with ca. the same result. Compared to master: module Fixes #6716 Fixes #6760 Fixes #6768 Fixes #6778",0

This is a broad subject, but some keywords include: A new module configuration section where you can import almost anything. You can configure both your own file mounts nd the file mounts of the modules you import. This is the new recommended way of configuring what you earlier put in configDir, staticDir etc. And it also allows you to mount folders in non-Hugo-projects, e.g. the SCSS folder in the Bootstrap GitHub project. A module consists of a set of mounts to the standard 7 component types in Hugo: static, content, layouts, data, assets, i18n, and archetypes. Yes, Theme Components can now include content, which should be very useful, especially in bigger multilingual projects. Modules not in your local file cache will be downloaded automatically and even ""hot replaced"" while the server is running. Hugo Modules supports and encourages semver versioned modules, and uses the minimal version selection algorithm to resolve versions. A new set of CLI commands are provided to manage all of this: hugo mod init,  hugo mod get,  hugo mod graph,  hugo mod tidy, and  hugo mod vendor. All of the above is backed by Go Modules.

This is all a preparation step for issue  #5074, ""pages from other data sources"". But this also fixes a set of annoying limitations, especially related to custom output formats, and shortcodes. Most notable changes: The inner content of shortcodes using the {{% as the outer-most delimiter will now be sent to the content renderer, e.g. Blackfriday.   This means that any markdown will partake in the global ToC and footnote context etc. The Custom Output formats are now ""fully virtualized"". This removes many of the current limitations. The taxonomy list type now has a reference to the Page object.   This improves the taxonomy template .Title situation and make common template constructs much simpler.

2690,Fix alignment of go gets in Dockerfile,0.5802436,Fix golint issues 5f2e1cb8 @moorereason ,"This commit adds support for a configuration directory (default config). The different pieces in this puzzle are: A new --environment (or -e) flag. This can also be set with the HUGO_ENVIRONMENT OS environment variable. The value for environment defaults to production when running hugo and development when running hugo server. You can set it to any value you want (e.g. hugo server -e ""Sensible Environment""), but as it is used to load configuration from the file system, the letter case may be important. You can get this value in your templates with {{ hugo.Environment }}. A new --configDir flag (defaults to config below your project). This can also be set with HUGO_CONFIGDIR OS environment variable. If the configDir exists, the configuration files will be read and merged on top of each other from left to right; the right-most value will win on duplicates. Given the example tree below: If environment is production, the left-most config.toml would be the one directly below the project (this can now be omitted if you want), and then _default/config.toml and finally production/config.toml. And since these will be merged, you can just provide the environment specific configuration setting in you production config, e.g. enableGitInfo = true. The order within the directories will be lexical (config.toml and then params.toml). bash config ├── _default │   ├── config.toml │   ├── languages.toml │   ├── menus │   │   ├── menus.en.toml │   │   └── menus.zh.toml │   └── params.toml ├── development │   └── params.toml └── production     ├── config.toml     └── params.toml Some configuration maps support the language code in the filename (e.g. menus.en.toml): menus (menu also works) and params. Also note that the only folders with ""a meaning"" in the above listing is the top level directories below config. The menus sub folder is just added for better organization. We use TOML in the example above, but Hugo also supports JSON and YAML as configuration formats. These can be mixed. Fixes #5422",0

Note that an inline shortcode's inner content is parsed and executed as a Go text template with the same context as a regular shortcode template. This means that the current page can be accessed via .Page.Title etc. This also means that there are no concept of ""nested inline shortcodes"". The same inline shortcode can be reused later in the same content file, with different params if needed, using the self-closing syntax: {{< time.inline />}} Fixes #4011",1

Now there is only one way, and it can be configured. This is the default configuration: toml [caches] [caches.getjson] dir = "":cacheDir"" maxAge = -1 [caches.getcsv] dir = "":cacheDir"" maxAge = -1 [caches.images] dir = "":resourceDir/_gen"" maxAge = -1 [caches.assets] dir = "":resourceDir/_gen"" maxAge = -1 You can override any of these cache setting in your own config.toml. The placeholders explained: :cacheDir: This is the value of the cacheDir config option if set (can also be set via OS env variable HUGO_CACHEDIR). It will fall back to /opt/build/cache/hugo_cache/ on Netlify, or a hugo_cache directory below the OS temp dir for the others. :resourceDir: This is the value of the resourceDir config option. maxAge is the time in seconds before a cache entry will be evicted, -1 means forever and 0 effectively turns that particular cache off. This means that if you run your builds on Netlify, all caches configured with :cacheDir will be saved and restored on the next build. For other CI vendors, please read their documentation.

This makes total sense, as it is wasteful and time-consuming to do SASS/SCSS/PostCSS processing for lots of languages when the output is lots of duplicates with different filenames. But since we now output the result once only, this had a negative side effect for multihost setups: We publish the resource once only to the root folder (i.e. not to the language ""domain folder""). This commit removes the language code from the processed image keys. This creates less duplication in the file cache, but it means that you should do a hugo --gc to clean up stale files.

The most important change in this commit is the update to .Site.GetPage: To reduce the amount of breakage in the wild to its minimum, I have reworked .Site.GetPage with some rules: We cannot support more than 2 arguments, i.e. .Site.GetPage ""page"" ""posts"" ""mypage.md"" will now throw an error. I think this is the most uncommon syntax and should be OK. It is an easy fix to change the above to .Site.GetPage ""/posts/mypage.md"" or similar. .Site.GetPage ""home"", .Site.GetPage ""home"" """" and .Site.GetPage ""home"" ""/"" will give you the home page. This means that if you have page in root with the name home.md you need to do .Site.GetPage ""/home.md"" or similar This commit also fixes some multilingual issues, most notable it is now possible to do cross-language ref/relref lookups by prepending the language code to the path, e.g. /jp/posts/mypage.md. This commit also reverts the site building tests related to this to ""Hugo 0.44 state"", to get better control of the changes made.

3127,markup/highlight: Add support to linkable line anchors on Chroma,0.81467444,Add support to linkable line anchors on Chroma fb0f2cc7 @fjorgemota #7622,"Before this commit, Suffix on MediaType was used both to set a custom file suffix and as a way to augment the mediatype definition (what you see after the ""+"", e.g. ""image/svg+xml""). This had its limitations. For one, it was only possible with one file extension per MIME type. Now you can specify multiple file suffixes using ""suffixes"", but you need to specify the full MIME type identifier: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""image/svg+xml""] suffixes = [""svg"", ""abc ] In most cases, it will be enough to just change: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""my/custom-mediatype""] suffix = ""txt"" To: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""my/custom-mediatype""] suffixes = [""txt""] Hugo will still respect values set in ""suffix"" if no value for ""suffixes"" is provided, but this will be removed in a future release. Note that you can still get the Media Type's suffix from a template: {{ $mediaType.Suffix }}. But this will now map to the MIME type filename. Fixes #4920",1

3156,Deprecate .File.Extension,0.71382624,Deprecate .File.Extension 94459680 @sara-meie #9352 ,"Before this commit, you would have to use page bundles to do image processing etc. in Hugo. This commit adds A new /assets top-level project or theme dir (configurable via assetDir) A new template func, resources.Get which can be used to ""get a resource"" that can be further processed. This means that you can now do this in your templates (or shortcodes): bash {{ $sunset := (resources.Get ""images/sunset.jpg"").Fill ""300x200"" }} This also adds a new extended build tag that enables powerful SCSS/SASS support with source maps. To compile this from source, you will also need a C compiler installed: HUGO_BUILD_TAGS=extended mage install Note that you can use output of the SCSS processing later in a non-SCSSS-enabled Hugo. The SCSS processor is a Resource transformation step and it can be chained with the many others in a pipeline: bash {{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | resources.ToCSS | resources.PostCSS | resources.Minify | resources.Fingerprint }}  The transformation funcs above have aliases, so it can be shortened to: bash {{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }}  A quick tip would be to avoid the fingerprinting part, and possibly also the not-superfast postCSS when you're doing development, as it allows Hugo to be smarter about the rebuilding. Documentation will follow, but have a look at the demo repo in link New functions to create Resource objects: resources.Get (see above) resources.FromString: Create a Resource from a string. New Resource transformation funcs: resources.ToCSS: Compile SCSS or SASS into CSS. resources.PostCSS: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option). resources.Minify: Currently supports css, js, json, html, svg, xml. resources.Fingerprint: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.. resources.Concat: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler. resources.ExecuteAsTemplate: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template. Fixes #4381 Fixes #4903 Fixes #4858",1

With this, it helps thinking about a theme as a set of ordered components: toml theme = [""my-shortcodes"", ""base-theme"", ""hyde""] The theme definition example above in config.toml creates a theme with the 3 components with presedence from left to right. So, Hugo will, for any given file, data entry etc., look first in the project, and then in my-shortcode, base-theme and lastly hyde. Hugo uses two different algorithms to merge the filesystems, depending on the file type: For i18n and data files, Hugo merges deeply using the translation id and data key inside the files. For static, layouts (templates) and archetypes files, these are merged on file level. So the left-most file will be chosen. The name used in the theme definition above must match a folder in /your-site/themes, e.g. /your-site/themes/my-shortcodes. There are  plans to improve on this and get a URL scheme so this can be resolved automatically. Also note that a component that is part of a theme can have its own configuration file, e.g. config.toml. There are currently some restrictions to what a theme component can configure: params (global and per language) menu (global and per language) outputformats and mediatypes The same rules apply here: The left-most param/menu etc. with the same ID will win. There are some hidden and experimental namespace support in the above, which we will work to improve in the future, but theme authors are encouraged to create their own namespaces to avoid naming conflicts. A final note: Themes/components can also have a theme definition in their config.toml and similar, which is the ""inheritance"" part of this commit's title. This is currently not supported by the Hugo theme site. We will have to wait for some ""auto dependency"" feature to be implemented for that to happen, but this can be a powerful feature if you want to create your own theme-variant based on others.

Before this commit, that behaviour was undefined. Note that this has never been an issue from regular templates. It will still not be possible to get the current shortcode's  page's rendered content. That would have impressed Einstein. The new and well defined rules are: .Page.Content from a shortcode will be empty. The related .Page.Truncated .Page.Summary, .Page.WordCount, .Page.ReadingTime, .Page.Plain and .Page.PlainWords will also have empty values. For other pages (retrieved via .Page.Site.GetPage, .Site.Pages etc.) the .Content is there to use as you please as long as you don't have infinite content recursion in your shortcode/content setup. See below. .Page.TableOfContents is good to go (but does not support shortcodes in headlines; this is unchanged) If you get into a situation of infinite recursion, the .Content will be empty.

The filename: content/english/post/my-post.nn.md will be read as Norwegian even if it lives in the English content folder.

This means that if both content/norwegian/post/my-post.md and content/english/post/my-post.nn.md exists, they will be considered duplicates and the version inside content/norwegian will win. Note that translations will be automatically assigned by Hugo by the content file's relative placement, so content/norwegian/post/my-post.md will be a translation of content/english/post/my-post.md.

Also, the filenames in these cases will make for very poor permalinks, so we will also use the remaining part as the page slug if that value is not set in front matter. This should make it easier to move content from Jekyll to Hugo. To enable, put this in your config.toml: toml [frontmatter] date  = ["":filename"", "":default""] This commit is also a spring cleaning of how the different dates are configured in Hugo. Hugo will check for dates following the configuration from left to right, starting with :filename etc. So, if you want to use the file modification time, this can be a good configuration: toml [frontmatter] date = [ ""date"","":fileModTime"", "":default""] lastmod = [""lastmod"" ,"":fileModTime"", "":default""] The current :default values for the different dates are toml [frontmatter] date = [""date"",""publishDate"", ""lastmod""] lastmod = [""lastmod"", ""date"",""publishDate""] publishDate = [""publishDate"", ""date""] expiryDate = [""expiryDate""] The above will now be the same as: toml [frontmatter] date = ["":default""] lastmod = ["":default""] publishDate = ["":default""] expiryDate = ["":default""] Note: We have some built-in aliases to the above: lastmod => modified, publishDate => pubdate, published and expiryDate => unpublishdate. If you want a new configuration for, say, date, you can provide only that line, and the rest will be preserved. All the keywords to the right that does not start with a "":"" maps to front matter parameters, and can be any date param (e.g. myCustomDateParam). The keywords to the left are the 4 predefined dates in Hugo, i.e. they are constant values. The current ""special date handlers"" are :fileModTime and :filename. We will soon add :git to that list.

To put it simply: If you change about.md, only that content page is read and processed, then Hugo does some processing (taxonomies etc.) and the full site is rendered. This commit covers the rendering part: We now only re-render the pages you work on, i.e. the last n pages you watched in the browser (which obviously also includes the  page in the example above). To be more specific: When you are running the hugo server in watch (aka. livereload) mode, and change a template or a content file, then we do a partial re-rendering of the following: The current content page (if it is a content change) The home page Up to the last 10 pages you visited on the site. This should in most cases be enough, but if you navigate to something completely different, you may see stale content. Doing an edit will then refresh that page.

3946,Release Hugo 0.30,0.84178686,"The v0.15.0 Hugo release brings a lot of polish to Hugo. Exactly 6 months after the 0.14 release, Hugo has seen massive growth and changes. Most notably, this is Hugo's first release under the Apache 2.0 license. With this license change we hope to expand the great community around Hugo and make it easier for our many users to contribute.  This release represents over 377 contributions by 87 contributors to the main Hugo repo and hundreds of improvements to the libraries Hugo uses. Hugo also launched a new theme showcase and participated in Hacktoberfest.",Why: first time using hugo I got very little info from --verbose output    but I noticed there is quite a lot of useful DEBUG logging asked for in other issues like link This change addreses the need by: adding a simple --debug flag which simply turns on debug level in stdout    and logoutput if enabled.,1

Note that for the top level folder there will be a potential name conflict with a section index.html (if enabled) This issue will not be relevant for subfolders in sections Hugo will soon add support for nested sections, but we will have to find a way to separate them from the rest (/content/_mysubsection maybe).

The interfaces and types in target made sense at some point, but now this package is too restricted to a hardcoded set of media types. The overall current logic: Create a file path based on some Translator with some hardcoded logic handling uglyURLs, hardcoded html suffix etc. In in some cases (alias), a template is applied to create the alias file. Then the content is written to destination. One could argue that it is the last bullet that is the actual core responsibility. This commit fixes that by moving the hugolib-related logic where it belong, and simplify the code, i.e. remove the abstractions.

The desired behavior is that .Truncated would evaluate to false when there was nothing after the user defined summary marker. This also adds a simple unit test to ensure that this feature isn't broken again.  The check for content after the user defined summary marker is done on the raw content instead of the working copy because some of the markup renderers add elements after the marker, making it difficult to determine if there is actually any content. The behavior (evaluating to false when there is no content, just summary) is also now documented.",1

4773,"Revert ""Expansion of unit tests for utils/utils.go""",0.69077456,Improved unit test coverage,"There are currently several Params and case related issues floating around in Hugo. This is very confusing for users and one of the most common support questions on the forum. And while there have been done some great leg work in Viper etc., this is of limited value since this and similar doesn't work: Params.myCamelCasedParam Hugo has control over all the template method invocations, and can take care of all the lower-casing of the map lookup keys. But that doesn't help with direct template lookups of type Site.Params.TWITTER_CONFIG.USER_ID. This commit solves that by doing some carefully crafted modifications of the templates' AST -- lowercasing the params keys. This is low-level work, but it's not like the template API wil change -- and this is important enough to defend such ""bit fiddling"". Tests are added for all the template engines: Go templates, Ace and Amber. Fixes #2615 Fixes #1129 Fixes #2590",0

An example: ContentDir: /mysites/site/content where /mysites/site/content is a symlink to /mycontent /mycontent: /mypost1.md /post/mypost2.md A change to mypost1.md (on OS X) will trigger a file change event with name ""/mycontent/mypost1.md"" A change to mypost2.md gives event with name ""/mysites/site/content/mypost2.md"" The first change will not trigger a correct update of Hugo before this commit.

This seems to be because Hugo tries to take the meminterval from the command line (an Int) and converts it to a String and passes it to time.ParseDuration. If you pass a different meminterval (such as 1000 as above) it will fail (time.ParseDuration requires some units) and use the default instead.

5381,media: support application/manifest+json,0.71899533,Friendlier json support,"This also includes a refactor of the hugofs package and its usage. The motivation for that is: The Afero filesystems are brilliant. Hugo's way of adding a dozen of global variables for the different filesystems was a mistake. In readFile (and also in some other places in Hugo today) we need a way to restrict the access inside the working dir. We could use ioutil.ReadFile and implement the path checking, checking the base path and the dots ("".."") etc. But it is obviously better to use an Afero BasePathFs combined witha ReadOnlyFs. We could create a use-once-filesystem and handle the initialization ourselves, but since this is also useful to others and the initialization depends on some other global state (which would mean to create a new file system on every invocation), we might as well do it properly and encapsulate the predefined set of filesystems. This change also leads the way, if needed, to encapsulate the file systems in a struct, making it possible to have several file system sets in action at once (parallel multilanguage site building? With Moore's law and all...) Fixes #1551",1

For example, sorting pages by 'Params.foo.bar' is possible by writing the following template code {{ range sort .Data.Pages ""Params.foo.bar"" }}     {{ .Content }} {{ end }} It ignores all leading and trailing dots so ""Params.foo.bar"" can be written in "".Params.foo.bar"" This also fixes the issue that 'sort' cannot evaluate a pointer value.

If asciidoctor is not installed, then asciidoc --safe -. To make sure asciidoctor or asciidoc is found, after adding    a piece of AsciiDoc content, run hugo with the -v flag    and look for this message: INFO: 2015/01/23 Rendering with /usr/bin/asciidoctor ... Caveats: The final ""Last updated"" timestamp is currently not stripped. When hugo is run with -v, you may see a lot of these messages INFO: 2015/01/23 Rendering with /usr/bin/asciidoctor ... if you have lots of .ad, .adoc or *.asciidoc files. Some versions of asciidoc may have trouble with its safe mode.    To test if you are affected, try this:$ echo ""Hello"" | asciidoc --safe - asciidoc: ERROR: unsafe: ifeval invalid asciidoc: FAILED: ifeval invalid safe document If so, I recommend that you install asciidoctor instead. Feedback and patches welcome! Ideally, we should be using link, @VonC's wonderful Go implementation of Asciidoctor.  However, there is still a bit of work needed for asciidocgo to expose its API so that Hugo can actually use it. Until then, hope this ""experimental AsciiDoc support through external helpers"" can serve as a stopgap solution for our community. :-) 2015-01-30: Updated for the replaceShortcodeTokens() syntax change 2015-02-21: Add .adoc extension as suggested by @Fale Conflicts:     helpers/content.go",0

6482,"create: Always print ""Content ... created""",0.8242334,"create: Always print ""Content ... created"" 43ac59da @bep #9157","This commit expands the test coverage for the utils/utils.go module. The utils module uses the 'github.com/spf13/jwalterweatherman' (aka jww) package for logging. The tests take the approach of examining the log file that is produced by this module to verify correct behaviour. This avoids refactoring the utils module. The log file messages written by the jww module are of the form: : yyyy/mm/dd  The checkLogFile function checks each of these parts in turn except for the date string, which is currently ignored. The final part of the log file format can either be a single error message, or a series of strings followed by an error message. Both the error message and the series of strings can be empty strings. The log file is checked using a combination of the regex package, along with the bufio scanner type. Each test logs to its own temporary log file. This is achieved with standard test setup and teardown functions. One consequence of these tests is that StopOnErr has been refactored into call a new unexported function doStopOnErr which contains the bulk of the original logic. This allows the same testing approach to be used with StopOnErr as with CheckErr and cutUsageMessage, rather than look at the exit status code of the test itself. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the author of the tests must now know if a log file is expected or not. If doStopOnErr determines that an empty error message would be written to the log file then nothing is written. In the context of the tests this means that the log file created by the test would have no contents. Consequently there would be nothing for the test to examine. This situation is indicated by the boolean flag logFileExoected in the testData struct, and processed by the logFileIsExpectedAndValid function. Although not ideal this was deemed a reasonable compromise.",1

Setting paginate to a positive value will split the list pages for the home page, sections and taxonomies into chunks of size of the paginate property. A .Paginator is provided to help building a pager menu. There are two ways to configure a .Paginator: The simplest way is just to call .Paginator.Pages from a template. It will contain the pages for ""that page"" (.Data.Pages will (like today) contain all the pages). Select a sub-set of the pages with the available template functions and pass the slice to .Paginate : {{ range (.Paginate (where .Data.Pages ""Type"" ""post"")).Pages }} NOTE: For a given Node, it's one of the options above. It's perfectly legitimate to iterate over the same pager more than once, but it's static and cannot change. The .Paginator contains enough information to build a full-blown paginator interface. The pages are built on the form (note: BLANK means no value, i.e. home page): [SECTION/TAXONOMY/BLANK]/index.html [SECTION/TAXONOMY/BLANK]/page/1/index.html => redirect to  [SECTION/TAXONOMY/BLANK]/index.html [SECTION/TAXONOMY/BLANK]/page/2/index.html ....

The result is then run through prepUrl(), which uses helpers.Urlize to convert urls such as 'My First Link' to 'my-first-link'. The behaviour is backwards: we do not want to run helpers.Urlize on the BaseUrl, only on the absolute component. Currently, a BaseUrl such as 'link' will be converted to 'link', resulting in broken links in all of my menus. This commit switches the URL prep and BaseUrl prepending actions around. I would argue that these URLs shouldn't be run through prepUrl anyway because the site developer has specified them explicitly in a config file and might be surprised for, e.g., URLs to change case, but that's another commit for another time.",1

If the reference is a page name (such as about.md), the page     will be discovered and the permalink will be returned: /about/ If the reference is a page name with a fragment (such as     about.md#who), the page will be discovered and used to add the     page.UniqueID() to the resulting fragment and permalink:     /about/#who:deadbeef. If the reference is a fragment and .Ref has been called from     a Node or SiteInfo, it will be returned as is: #who. If the reference is a fragment and .Ref has been called from     a Page, it will be returned with the page’s unique ID:     #who:deadbeef. .*Ref can be called from either Node, SiteInfo (e.g.,     Node.Site), Page objects, or ShortcodeWithPage objects in     templates. .*Ref cannot be used in content, so two shortcodes have been     created to provide the functionality to content: ref and relref.     These are intended to be used within markup, like Who or Who. There are also ref and relref template functions (used to create     the shortcodes) that expect a Page or Node object and the     reference string (e.g., {{ relref . ""about.md"" }} or {{     ""about.md"" | ref . }}). It actually looks for .*Ref as defined on     Node or Page objects. Shortcode handling had to use a differently unique wrapper in     createShortcodePlaceholder because of the way that the ref and     relref are intended to be used in content.",1

6769,docs: Rename dynamic content to data-driven content,0.5282537,"target=""content/docs""","This commit contains a restructuring and partial rewrite of the shortcode handling. Prior to this commit rendering of the page content was mingled with handling of the shortcodes. This led to several oddities. The new flow is: Shortcodes are extracted from page and replaced with placeholders. Shortcodes are processed and rendered Page is processed The placeholders are replaced with the rendered shortcodes The handling of summaries is also made simpler by this. This commit also introduces some other chenges: distinction between shortcodes that need further processing and those who do not: {{< >}}: Typically raw HTML. Will not be processed. {{% %}}: Will be processed by the page's markup engine (Markdown or (infuture) Asciidoctor) The above also involves a new shortcode-parser, with lexical scanning inspired by Rob Pike's talk called ""Lexical Scanning in Go"", which should be easier to understand, give better error messages and perform better. If you want to exclude a shortcode from being processed (for documentation etc.), the inner part of the shorcode must be commented out, i.e. {{%/ movie 47238zzb /%}}. See the updated shortcode section in the documentation for further examples. The new parser supports nested shortcodes. This isn't new, but has two related design choices worth mentioning: The shortcodes will be rendered individually, so If both {{< >}} and {{% %}} are used in the nested hierarchy, one will be passed through the page's markdown processor, the other not. To avoid potential costly overhead of always looking far ahead for a possible closing tag, this implementation looks at the template itself, and is branded as a container with inner content if it contains a reference to .Inner Fixes #565 Fixes #480 Fixes #461 And probably some others.",0

6798,Remove credit from release notes,0.8174232,"Revert ""Remove credit from release notes"" fab1e43d @digitalcraftsman ","FileAndExt has now be completely rewritten and now works as may reasonably be expected. The test cases for: ReplaceExtension Filename FileAndExt now all pass. The problem was the way path.Base was being used. Firstly Base returns ""."" if the directory is empty, but it can also return ""."" for the current directory, or "".."" for the parent directory, if these are the last elements in the path. Simply detecting the presence of a ""."" in the returned string and truncating before the ""."" does not therefore always result in a valid filename. Secondly, Base strips any trailing slashes making is more difficult to detect when the path does not end in a filename but in a directory name i.e. a no filename case. Not detecting this incorrectly results in the last directory name being returned as the filename. The code has been updated to take account of of both situations so that: 1) An empty string for both the filename and extension is returned if the path does not contain a filename (plus an optional extension). This includes both the empty path case, and the ends in a directory case. 2) If the path represents a filename with an extension then both the filename and the extension (minus any dots) are returned as non empty strings. 3) If the path represents a filename without an extension then filename will be returned as a non empty string (minus any dot) and the extension will be returned as an empty string.",1

This made it hard (if possible at all) to mark the currently selected menu item/group for non-Page content (home page, category pages etc.), i.e. for menus defined in the site configuration. This commit provides an implementation of these two methods. Notable design choices: These menu items have a loose coupling to the the resources they navigate to; the Url is the best common identificator. To facilitate a consistent matching, and to get it in line with the menu items connected to Page, relative Urls (Urls starting with '/') for menu items in the site configuration are converted to permaLinks using the same rules used for others’. IsMenuCurrent only looks at the children of the current node; this is in line with the implementation on Page. Due to this loose coupling, IsMenuCurrent have to search downards in the tree to make sure that the node is inside the current menu. This could have been made simpler if it could answer yes to any match of any menu item matching the current resource. This commit also adds a set of unit tests for the menu system. Fixes #367",0

There are two problems: 1.) We're creating a new goroutine for every page. 2.) We're calling s.Pages = append(s.Pages, page) inside each goroutine. 1 is a problem if in that if you have a ton of pages, that's a ton of goroutines.  It's not really useful to have more than a few goroutines at a time, and lots can actually make your code much slower, and, evidently, crash. 2 is a problem in that append is not thread safe. Sometimes it returns a new slice with a larger capacity, when the original slice isn't large enough.  This can cause problems if two goroutines do this at the same time. The solution for 1 is to use a limited number of workers (I chose 2*GOMAXPROCS as a nice guess). The solution for 2 is to serialize access to s.Pages, which I did by doing it in a single goroutine.",0

Go's URL resolution library sees the leading slash and thinks ""this URL starts at the root"", just like a filesystem - so it discards your subdomain and maps all custom permalinks from the root of your site. Fine if you control the root domain, not so useful if you don't. Removing the check for a leading slash fixes this problem. You can now specify custom permalinks that do not start with a slash, and they will map safely regardless of what subdomain you upload the generated site under.
