These regexps may have some false positives -- e.g. strings that needs to be quoted. For that rare case, you can mark the string with e.g. module For the opposite case:  module  Updates #10632"
90,resource_transformers/tocss: Fixed hugo:vars casting,Variables passed via the hugo:vars function where passed as type string. This caused problems when using the variables in sass functions because these expect a specific type. Now we check if the passed variables have to be quoted and therefore are of type string or if they should not be quoted and let the type interpretation up to the sass compiler. Fixes #10632

92,tpl/internal: Sync Go template src to Go 1.20,Updates #10691
93,build: Update to Go 1.20,Updates #10691
94,Add page fragments support to Related,"The main topic of this commit is that you can now index fragments (content heading identifiers) when calling module. You can do this by:  Configure one or more indices with type module The name of those index configurations maps to an (optional) front matter slice with fragment references. This allows you to link page<->fragment and page<->page. This also will index all the fragments (heading identifiers) of the pages.  It's also possible to use type module indices in shortcode, e.g.: module But, and this is important, you need to include the shortcode using the module delimiter. Not doing so will create infinite loops and timeouts. This commit also:  Adds two new methods to Page: Fragments (can also be used to build ToC) and HeadingsFiltered (this is only used in Related Content with index type module and module set to true. Consolidates all module methods into one, which takes either a module or an options map as its only argument. Add module to all of the content related Page API. Turns out it wasn't strictly needed for this particular feature, but it will soon become usefil, e.g. in #9339.  Closes #10711 Updates #9339 Updates #10725"

This happens because the strings are first converted to floating values to check whether or not they should be sorted as floating values. When an error is returned the strings will be handled as string literals. No error will be returned when parsing Inf, Infinity or NaN (case insensitive) because they will be coverted to special floating point values and therefore are legal float values.

156,tocss: Add some more test cases,See #10555
157,tocss: Fix unquote case with double quotes,See #10555
158,"Allow ""fast render mode"" even if --disableLiveReload is set",Fixes #10561
159,tocss: Add vars option,"This commit adds a new module option to both the Sass transpilers (Dart Sass and Libsass). This means that you can pass a map with key/value pairs to the transpiler: module And the the variables will be available in the module namespace. Example usage for Dart Sass: ```scss @use ""hugo:vars"" as v; p {     color: v.$color1;     font-size: v.$font_size; } ``` Note that Libsass does not support the module keyword, so you need to module them as global variables: ```scss @import ""hugo:vars""; p {     color: $color1;     font-size: $font_size; } ``` Hugo will:  Add a missing leading module for the variable names if needed. Wrap the values in module (Sass built-in) to get proper handling of identifiers vs other strings.  This means that you can pull variables directly from e.g. the site config: module module Fixes #10555"

We do this evaluation when we start a new rendering a new output format. There are, however, situation where these borders gets crossed (e.g. accessing content from another output format). We have a check for this in place for most cases, but not the content rendering of inner markdown blocks inside shortcodes.

318,Fix shortcode parser regression with quoted param values,"This issue was introduced in module. In 223bf2800488ad5d38854bbb595d789bc35ebe32 we removed the byte source from the parsed page result, which meant we had to preserve exact positioning for all elements. This introduced some new module tokens which we, wrongly, assumed didn't matter where we put in the result slice (they should be ignored anyway). But it seems that this broke the logic where we determine if it's positional or named params in the case where the paramater value contains escaped quoutes. This commit makes sure that these ignore tokens (the back slashes) are never sent back to the client, which is how it was before module. This commit also fixes some lost error information in that same commit. Fixes #10236"

320,"snap: Use ""snapcraftctl set-grade""","This, together with 'snapcraftctl set-version"", negates the need to modify snap/snapcraft.yaml upon each release, so the corresponding code is removed from releaser/releaser.go. Also, vendorInfo is extended to include the snap version number. See #10225"
321,"snap: Use ""snapcraftctl set-version""","This allows the use of ""git describe --tags"" to recognize lightweight version tags, and the removal of initial ""v"" in the hugo snap version. See #10225"
322,snap: Make external dependencies actually work,"Git:  - Set GIT_EXEC_PATH and include usr/lib/git-core so that git can find the    git-remote-https helper (needed by e.g. ""go mod download""). Go:  - Put Go in its own snap part, and use stage-snaps instead of build-snaps    so that it is included in the final snap.  - Set GOCACHE to a writable directory. (In a previous commit,    HOME is set to $SNAP_REAL_HOME which is unwritable.) Hugo:  - Patch config/security/securityConfig.go ""[security.exec] osEnv"" whitelist    (during snap build) so that external dependencies can use the required    environment variables to run properly from within the snap. Asciidoctor:  - Replace shebang line in asciidoctor so it can find the ruby executable.  - Set RUBYLIB so that Ruby can find its libraries.    Caveat/TODO: The Ruby version is hardcoded in our custom RUBYLIB. Embedded Dart Sass:  - Download from GitHub and install it, for amd64 and arm64 only. Node.js:  - Remove my incomplete include list so that npx is actually installed.  - Set npm_config_{cache,init_module,userconfig} to writable locations. Pandoc:  - Set pandoc_datadir so that Pandoc can find its data files. rst2html:  - Install python3-docutils package for rst2html, rst2html5, etc.  - Set PYTHONHOME so that Python can find its libraries. Note that asciidoctor, pandoc and rst2html are not in Hugo’s default ""[security.exec] allow"" whitelist, and the snap package does not change that default, so they still needed to be whitelisted manually in config.toml if necessary by the end user. Special thanks to Joe Mooring (@jmooring) for meticulously diagnosing the issue and providing a comprehensive test repository at https://github.com/jmooring/hugo-snap-test without which I would not have been able to understand and resolve the issue.

345,github: Use GitHub's Choco-Install function to retry installs,"Apparently, two instances of ""choco install mingw"" running simultaneously (for go-version 1.18.x and 1.19.x) would often cause at least one of them to fail to connect to SourceForge: module With Choco-Install however, it simply works every single time! Thanks to keymanapp/api.keyman.com#156 for the great tip!

This is mainly meant for shortcodes that produces Markdown to be inlined. You would do this by creating shortcodes with module suffix (e.g. module).

425,postcss: Make the resource cache key more stable,"By using the input map as the basis, which means the hash will not change if we add/rename/remove options. This happened in Hugo 0.99, as we added a new options. This is unortunate.

531,deploy: Set an MD5 attribute and use that if eTag not available,During Hugo deploy when a remote MD5 is invalid (e.g due to multipart eTag) Hugo reads the entire remote file and calculates the MD5 again which can be slow. This commit updates the file upload so that it will also store an MD5 hash in the cloud provider's attributes. e.g in AWS this looks like x-amz-meta-md5chksum: 26fe392386a8123bf8956a16e08cb841.

596,Fail with error when double-rendering text in markdownify/RenderString,"This commit prevents the most commons case of infinite recursion in link render hooks when the module option is enabled (see below). This is always a user error, but getting a module (the current stack limit in Go is 1 GB on 64-bit, 250 MB on 32-bit) error isn't very helpful. This fix will not prevent all such errors, though, but we may do better once #9570 is in place. So, these will fail: module module is already rendered to module. The above needs to be rewritten to: module Fixes #8959"

Another popular alternative for diagrams in Markdown, Mermaid (supported by GitHub), can also be implemented with a simple template. See the Hugo documentation for more information.

682,tpl/partials: Fix recently introduced deadlock in partials cache,"The change in lock logic for module in  0927cf739fee9646c7fb917965799d9acf080922 was naive as it didn't consider cached partials calling other cached partials. This changeset may look on the large side for this particular issue, but it pulls in part of a working branch, introducing module in the template execution. Note that the context is only partially implemented in this PR, but the upcoming use cases will, as one example, include having access to the top ""dot"" (e.g. module) all the way down into partials and shortcodes etc. The earlier benchmarks rerun against master: ```bash name              old time/op    new time/op    delta IncludeCached-10    13.6ms ± 2%    13.8ms ± 1%    ~     (p=0.343 n=4+4) name              old alloc/op   new alloc/op   delta IncludeCached-10    5.30MB ± 0%    5.35MB ± 0%  +0.96%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) name              old allocs/op  new allocs/op  delta IncludeCached-10     74.7k ± 0%     75.3k ± 0%  +0.77%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) ``` Fixes #9519"

753,Fix missing page data for alternative formats,"When a template calls the .Translations function and a Hugo environment is using multiple output formats, a template that calls methods like .Summary and .Len on each translation will unexpectedly show empty return values for these methods. This is because each pageOutput's ContentProvider is assigned to a page.NopPage in newPageOutput. When HugoSites.render assigns pageContentOutputs to pageOutputs in pageState.shiftToOutputFormat, it reuses pageContentOutputs from other pageOutputs, leaving some pageContentOutputs as NopPages. While this approach conserves resources, sometimes it means that a template will unexpectedly call a method on a pageContentOutput that is actually a NopPage. In the case of ContentProvider methods called on translations for alternative output formats, the methods were called on NopPages. This change introduces LazyContentProvider, which performs late initialization when one of its methods is called. This way, we can reuse content in ""normal"" cases but ensure that ContentProvider methods work as expected when a pageOutput is not assigned a pageContentOutput during the initial pre-render phase. Fixes #8919"

770,Fix surprise OutputFormat.Rel overwriting,"In page.NewOutputFormat, we take an output.Format f and use it to create a page.OutputFormat. If the format is canonical, we assign the final OutputFormat's Rel to ""canonical"" rather than using f.Rel. However, this leads to unexpected behavior for custom output formats, where a user can define a ""rel"" for a format via the config file. For example, the standard for ""humans.txt"" files requires using rel=""author"" in HTML ""link"" elements. Meanwhile, humans.txt is usually the only format used for its content. As a result, for Hugo configurations that define a humans.txt custom output format, Hugo will render ""link"" elements to content in this format with rel=""canonical,"" rather than ""author"" as required by the standard. This commit changes page.NewOutputFormat to check whether a given format is user defined and, if so, skips assigning Rel to ""canonical,"" even if isCanonical is true. Fixes #8030"

This commit also adds ttf and otf media type definitions to Hugo. Fixes #9302 Fixes #9301"
798,Add resources.GetRemote,"In Hugo 0.89 we added remote support to module. In hindsight that was not a great idea, as a poll from many Hugo users showed. See Issue #9285 for more details. After this commit module only supports local resource lookups. If you want to support both, you need to use a construct similar to: Also improve some option case handling. module Fixes #9285 Fixes #9296"
799,Allow for return partials with falsy arguments (#9298),"Partials with returns values are parsed, then inserted into a partial return wrapper via wrapInPartialReturnWrapper in order to assign the return value via contextWrapper.Set. The predefined wrapper template for partials inserts a partial's nodes into a ""with"" template action in order to set dot to a contextWrapper within the partial. However, because ""with"" is skipped if its argument is falsy, partials with falsy arguments were not being evaluated. This replaces the ""with"" action in the partial wrapper with a ""range"" action that isn't skipped if .Arg is falsy. Fixes #7528"

801,"don't use path.Join, because it cleans the final path",
802,Add some basic security policies with sensible defaults,"This ommmit contains some security hardening measures for the Hugo build runtime. There are some rarely used features in Hugo that would be good to have disabled by default. One example would be the ""external helpers"". For module and some others we use Go's module package to start a new process. These are a predefined set of binary names, all loaded from module and with a predefined set of arguments. Still, if you don't use module in your project, you might as well have it turned off. You can configure your own in the new module configuration section, but the defaults are configured to create a minimal amount of site breakage. And if that do happen, you will get clear instructions in the loa about what to do. The default configuration is listed below. Note that almost all of these options are regular expression whitelists (a string or a slice); the value module will block all. ```toml [security]   enableInlineShortcodes = false   [security.exec]     allow = ['^dart-sass-embedded$', '^go$', '^npx$', '^postcss$']     osEnv = ['(?i)^(PATH|PATHEXT|APPDATA|TMP|TEMP|TERM)$'] [security.funcs]     getenv = ['^HUGO_'] [security.http]     methods = ['(?i)GET|POST']     urls = ['.*'] ```"

References:  https://twittercommunity.com/t/consolidating-the-oembed-functionality/154690 https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/oembed-api#Embedded  This is a backward compatible change. The existing endpoint requires a single parameter: the id of the tweet. The new endpoint requires two parameters: the id of the tweet, and the user with whom it is associated. For the moment, if you supply the wrong user, the request will be redirected (with a small delay) to the correct user/id pair. This behavior is undocumented, but we will take advantage of it as Hugo site authors transition to the new syntax. {{< tweet 1453110110599868418 >}} --> works, throws warning, deprecate at some point {{< tweet user=""SanDiegoZoo"" id=""1453110110599868418"" >}} --> new syntax Fixes #8130"

933,Pass minification errors to the user,"Previously, *minifyTransformation.Transform suppressed the error returned by t.m.Minify. This meant that when minification returned an error, the error would not reach the user. Instead, minification would silently fail. For example, if a JavaScript file included a call to the Date constructor with: new Date(2020, 04, 02) The package that the minification library uses to parse JS files, github.com/tdewolff/parse would return an error, since ""04"" would be parsed as a legacy octal. However, the JS file would remain un-minified with no error. Fixing this is not as simple as replacing ""_"" with an ""err"" in *minifyTransformation.Transform, however (though this is necessary). If we only returned this error from Transform, then hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled would fail. Instead of being a no-op, as TestResourceMinifyDisabled expects, using the ""minify"" template function with a ""disableXML=true"" config setting instead returns the error, ""minifier does not exist for mimetype."" The ""minifier does not exist"" error is returned because of the way minifiers.New works. If the user's config disables minification for a particular MIME type, minifiers.New does not add it to the resulting Client's minify.M. However, this also means that when the ""minify"" template function is executed,  a resourceAdapter's transformations still add a minification. When it comes time to call the minify.Minifier for a specific MIME type via *M.MinifyMimetype, the github.com/tdewolff/minify library throws the ""does not exist"" error for the missing MIME type. The solution was to change minifiers.New so, instead of skipping a minifier for each disabled MIME type, it adds  a NoOpMinifier, which simply copies the source to the destination without minification. This means that when the ""minify"" template function is used for a particular resource, and that resource's MIME type has minification disabled, minification is genuinely skipped, and does not result in an error. In order to add this, I've fixed a possibly unwanted interaction between minifiers.TestConfigureMinify and hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled. The latter disables minification and expects minification to be a no-op. The former disables minification and expects it to result in an error. The only reason hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled passes in the original code is that the ""does not exist"" error is suppressed. However, we shouldn't suppress minification errors, since they can leave users perplexed. I've changed the test assertion in minifiers.TestConfigureMinify to expect no errors and a no-op if minification is disabled for a particular MIME type. Fixes #8954"
934,"Clarify ""precision"" in currency format functions",The documentation of the FormatAccounting and FormatCurrency functions could be clearer in terms of how the precision param works.

1194,langs/i18n: Revise the plural implementation,"There were some issues introduced with the plural counting when we upgraded from v1 to v2 of go-i18n. This commit improves that situation given the following rules:  A single integer argument is used as plural count and passed to the i18n template as a int type with a module method. The latter is to preserve compability with v1. Else the plural count is either fetched from the module/module field/method/map or from the value itself. Any data type is accepted, if it can be converted to an integer, that value is used.  The above means that you can now do pass a single integer and both of the below will work: module Fixes #8454 Closes #7822 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1410"

1229,org: Disable broken pretty relative links feature,go-org PrettyRelativeLinks rewrites relative org links by - adding module in front - removing any module suffix This was meant to play well with hugo pretty urls (which pretty much renders posts in a subdirectory without the file suffix) and allow use of normal org file links to reference other posts. There's a lot of edge cases I didn't consider and multiple bug reports in go-org [1] later I don't think the complexity of handling those edge cases is worth it - so let's disable it.

1610,markup/asciidoc: Add support for .TableOfContents,"Fill the .TableOfContents template variable when writing Asciidoc content. This is done by letting Asciidoc render its TOC as HTML, then extract this HTML rendered TOC, parse it into a tableofcontents.Root and finally remove it from the HTML content. This aims to stay in the logic that the Asciidoc parsing is entirely done by the external helper. See #1687"

1685,Rework external asciidoctor integration ,"This commit solves the relative path problem with asciidoctor tooling. An include will resolve relatively, so you can refer easily to files in the same folder. Also module and PlantUML rendering works now, because the created temporary files will be placed in the correct folder. This patch covers just the Ruby version of asciidoctor. The old AsciiDoc CLI EOLs in Jan 2020, so this variant is removed from code. The configuration is completely rewritten and now available in module under the key module: module  backends, safe-modes, and extensions are now whitelisted to the popular (ruby) extensions and valid values. the default for extensions is to not enable any, because they're all external dependencies so the build would break if the user didn't install them beforehand. the default backend is html5 because html5s is an external gem dependency. the default safe-mode is safe, explanations of the modes: https://asciidoctor.org/man/asciidoctor/ the config is namespaced under asciidocext_config and the parser looks at asciidocext to allow a future native Go asciidoc. module option and module flag are supported module flag is required  Follow the updated documentation under module.  This patch would be a breaking change, because you need to correct all your absolute include pathes to relative paths, so using relative paths must be configured explicitly by setting module."

Once I found this blog post, I solved the issue in minutes: https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/hugo-timeout-not-a-circular-loop-in-shortcode/ Googling the error message yields several additional posts from users who focus on loops in their shortcode when the problem seems to be overly-expensive builds."

1806,Collect HTML elements during the build to use in PurgeCSS etc.,"The main use case for this is to use with resources.PostProcess and resources.PostCSS with purgecss. You would normally set it up to extract keywords from your templates, doing it from the full /public takes forever for bigger sites. Doing the template thing misses dynamically created class names etc., and it's hard/impossible to set up in when using themes. You can enable this in your site config: module It will then write a module file to the project root as part of the build. If you're only using this for the production build, you should consider putting it below module. You can then set it up with PostCSS like this: ```js const purgecss = require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')({     content: [ './hugo_stats.json' ],     defaultExtractor: (content) => {         let els = JSON.parse(content).htmlElements;         return els.tags.concat(els.classes, els.ids);     } }); module.exports = {     plugins: [         require('tailwindcss'),         require('autoprefixer'),         ...(process.env.HUGO_ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? [ purgecss ] : [])     ] }; ``` Fixes #6999"

1947,Introduce a tree map for all content,"This commit introduces a new data structure to store pages and their resources. This data structure is backed by radix trees. This simplies tree operations, makes all pages a bundle,  and paves the way for #6310. It also solves a set of annoying issues (see list below). Not a motivation behind this, but this commit also makes Hugo in general a little bit faster and more memory effective (see benchmarks). Especially for partial rebuilds on content edits, but also when taxonomies is in use. ``` name                                   old time/op    new time/op    delta SiteNew/Bundle_with_image/Edit-16        1.32ms ± 8%    1.00ms ± 9%  -24.42%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file/Edit-16    1.28ms ± 0%    0.94ms ± 0%  -26.26%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories/Edit-16      33.9ms ± 2%    21.8ms ± 1%  -35.67%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs/Edit-16            40.6ms ± 1%    37.7ms ± 3%   -7.20%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree/Edit-16        56.7ms ± 0%    51.7ms ± 1%   -8.82%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates/Edit-16      19.9ms ± 2%    18.3ms ± 3%   -7.64%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections/Edit-16         37.9ms ± 4%    34.0ms ± 2%  -10.28%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_image-16             10.7ms ± 0%    10.6ms ± 0%   -1.15%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file-16         10.8ms ± 0%    10.7ms ± 0%   -1.05%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories-16           43.2ms ± 1%    39.6ms ± 1%   -8.35%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs-16                 47.6ms ± 1%    47.3ms ± 0%     ~     (p=0.057 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16             73.0ms ± 1%    74.2ms ± 1%     ~     (p=0.114 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates-16           37.9ms ± 0%    38.1ms ± 1%     ~     (p=0.114 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections-16              53.6ms ± 1%    54.7ms ± 1%   +2.09%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) name                                   old alloc/op   new alloc/op   delta SiteNew/Bundle_with_image/Edit-16         486kB ± 0%     430kB ± 0%  -11.47%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file/Edit-16     265kB ± 0%     209kB ± 0%  -21.06%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories/Edit-16      13.6MB ± 0%     8.8MB ± 0%  -34.93%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs/Edit-16            66.5MB ± 0%    63.9MB ± 0%   -3.95%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree/Edit-16        28.8MB ± 0%    25.8MB ± 0%  -10.55%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates/Edit-16      6.16MB ± 0%    5.56MB ± 0%   -9.86%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections/Edit-16         16.9MB ± 0%    16.0MB ± 0%   -5.19%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_image-16             2.28MB ± 0%    2.29MB ± 0%   +0.35%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file-16         2.07MB ± 0%    2.07MB ± 0%     ~     (p=0.114 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories-16           14.3MB ± 0%    13.2MB ± 0%   -7.30%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs-16                 69.1MB ± 0%    69.0MB ± 0%     ~     (p=0.343 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16             31.3MB ± 0%    31.8MB ± 0%   +1.49%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates-16           10.8MB ± 0%    10.9MB ± 0%   +1.11%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections-16              21.4MB ± 0%    21.6MB ± 0%   +1.15%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) name                                   old allocs/op  new allocs/op  delta SiteNew/Bundle_with_image/Edit-16         4.74k ± 0%     3.86k ± 0%  -18.57%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file/Edit-16     4.73k ± 0%     3.85k ± 0%  -18.58%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories/Edit-16        301k ± 0%      198k ± 0%  -34.14%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs/Edit-16              389k ± 0%      373k ± 0%   -4.07%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree/Edit-16          338k ± 0%      262k ± 0%  -22.63%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates/Edit-16        102k ± 0%       88k ± 0%  -13.81%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections/Edit-16           176k ± 0%      152k ± 0%  -13.32%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_image-16              26.8k ± 0%     26.8k ± 0%   +0.05%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Bundle_with_JSON_file-16          26.8k ± 0%     26.8k ± 0%   +0.05%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Tags_and_categories-16             273k ± 0%      245k ± 0%  -10.36%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Canonify_URLs-16                   396k ± 0%      398k ± 0%   +0.39%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16               317k ± 0%      325k ± 0%   +2.53%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Many_HTML_templates-16             146k ± 0%      147k ± 0%   +0.98%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) SiteNew/Page_collections-16                210k ± 0%      215k ± 0%   +2.44%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) ``` Fixes #6312 Fixes #6087 Fixes #6738 Fixes #6412 Fixes #6743 Fixes #6875 Fixes #6034 Fixes #6902 Fixes #6173 Fixes #6590"

2012,tpl/tplimpl: Rework template management to get rid of concurrency issues,"This more or less completes the simplification of the template handling code in Hugo started in v0.62. The main motivation was to fix a long lasting issue about a crash in HTML content files  without front matter. But this commit also comes with a big functional improvement. As we now have moved the base template evaluation to the build stage we now use the same lookup rules for module as for module etc. type of templates. This means that in this simple example you can have a module template for the module section without having to duplicate the others: module Also, when simplifying code, you often get rid of some double work, as shown in the ""site building"" benchmarks below. These benchmarks looks suspiciously good, but I have repeated the below with ca. the same result.

2083,Rework template handling for function and map lookups,"This is a big commit, but it deletes lots of code and simplifies a lot.  Resolving the template funcs at execution time means we don't have to create template clones per site Having a custom map resolver means that we can remove the AST lower case transformation for the special lower case Params map  Not only is the above easier to reason about, it's also faster, especially if you have more than one language, as in the benchmark below: ``` name                          old time/op    new time/op    delta SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16    53.7ms ± 0%    48.1ms ± 2%  -10.38%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) name                          old alloc/op   new alloc/op   delta SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16    41.0MB ± 0%    36.8MB ± 0%  -10.26%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) name                          old allocs/op  new allocs/op  delta SiteNew/Deep_content_tree-16      481k ± 0%      410k ± 0%  -14.66%  (p=0.029 n=4+4) ``` This should be even better if you also have lots of templates.

2155,Support Go time format strings in permalinks,"In the vein of an ancient TODO about supporting custom date formatting with strftime, this allows module-prefixed Go time format strings in permalink segments. This allows users to customize date-based permalinks any way they need to. For example, with a date of 2019-11-09, the permalink module will render as module. See: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/07978e4a4922bc21c230fee65052232b829bd1ab#diff-0688a3b65c7f5d01aa216f8d9b57fd00R111-R112 https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/implementing-additional-date-formats-for-permalinks/17860 https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/6488"

2173,"Dockerfile: Switch to mage builds, various optimizations", Use Alpine for both stages for consistency. Switch to mage from go install as dictated in the latest docs. Easy switch to building Hugo Extended by directly setting HUGO_BUILD_TAGS flag at image build time: module Update to Go 1.13 and Alpine 3.10. The only possibly breaking change: Moved the module binary in the final stage from /hugo to /usr/bin/hugo so one can simply run module without having to search around for its location.

2210,Add BaseFs to RenderingContext,The org mode renderer supports including other files [1]. We don't want to allow reading of arbitrary files (go-org defaults to ioutil.ReadFile [2]) but want to make use of the FileSystem abstractions hugo provides.

2385,Add Hugo Modules,"This commit implements Hugo Modules. This is a broad subject, but some keywords include:  A new module configuration section where you can import almost anything. You can configure both your own file mounts nd the file mounts of the modules you import. This is the new recommended way of configuring what you earlier put in module, module etc. And it also allows you to mount folders in non-Hugo-projects, e.g. the module folder in the Bootstrap GitHub project. A module consists of a set of mounts to the standard 7 component types in Hugo: module, module, module, module, module, module, and module. Yes, Theme Components can now include content, which should be very useful, especially in bigger multilingual projects. Modules not in your local file cache will be downloaded automatically and even ""hot replaced"" while the server is running. Hugo Modules supports and encourages semver versioned modules, and uses the minimal version selection algorithm to resolve versions. A new set of CLI commands are provided to manage all of this: module,  module,  module,  module, and  module.  All of the above is backed by Go Modules.

2411,tpl/collections: Unwrap any interface value in sort and where,"Hugo module introduced some new interface types for module etc. This worked great in general, but there were cases where this would fail in module and module. One such example would be sorting by module where module on module was a small subset of the bigger module interface. This commit fixes that by unwrapping such interface values. Fixes #5989"
2412,Refactor Org mode front matter: Introduce '#+KEY[]:' array notation,"Hugo requires some front matter values to be arrays (e.g. for taxonomies). Org mode front matter syntax (module) does however not support anything but string values normally - which is why goorgeous hardcoded the values for the keys tags, categories & aliases to be parsed as string arrays. This causes problems with custom taxonomies. A simple thing we can do instead is make keywords ending in '[]' be parsed as string arrays."
2413,Improve Org mode support: Replace goorgeous with go-org,"Sadly, goorgeous has not been updated in over a year and still has a lot of open issues (e.g. no support for nested lists). go-org fixes most of those issues and supports a larger subset of Org mode syntax."

The reason have been narrowed down to that of parallel rebuilds. This isn't a new thing, but the changes in 0.55.0 made it extra important to serialize the page initialization. This commit fixes that by protecting the module method with a lock when running in server mode. Fixes #5885 Fixes #5968"
2438,tpl: Fix internal templates usage of safeHTMLAttr,"The module function operates on a full attribute definition, not just within the attribute value. Docs: https://gohugo.io/functions/safehtmlattr/ For module, run the whole module HTML attribute through module. That will preserve module signs in formatted dates. For module, module was in the context of an attribute value, thus having no effect. In this case we could replace it with module, but since the code is coming from an API it is safer to just let Go's template engine sanitize the value as it already does with module.

2500,hugolib: Fix bundle resource publishing when multiple output formats,"The faulty logic published the bundled resources for the ""first output"" format.

2501,hugolib: Fix panic for unused taxonomy content files,"In Hugo 0.55 we connected the taxonomy nodes with their owning Page. This failed if you had, say, a content file for a author that did not author anything in the site: module Fixes #5847"

2566,Make Page an interface,"The main motivation of this commit is to add a module interface to replace the very file-oriented module struct. This is all a preparation step for issue  #5074, ""pages from other data sources"". But this also fixes a set of annoying limitations, especially related to custom output formats, and shortcodes. Most notable changes:  The inner content of shortcodes using the module as the outer-most delimiter will now be sent to the content renderer, e.g. Blackfriday.   This means that any markdown will partake in the global ToC and footnote context etc. The Custom Output formats are now ""fully virtualized"". This removes many of the current limitations. The taxonomy list type now has a reference to the module object.   This improves the taxonomy template module situation and make common template constructs much simpler.

2575,tpl/tplimpl: Fix template truth logic,"Before this commit, due to a bug in Go's module package, this would print different output for typed nil interface values: module This commit works around this by wrapping every module and module with a custom module template func with truth logic that matches module, module and module.

2666,Add /config dir support,"This commit adds support for a configuration directory (default module). The different pieces in this puzzle are:  A new module (or module) flag. This can also be set with the module OS environment variable. The value for module defaults to module when running module and module when running module. You can set it to any value you want (e.g. module), but as it is used to load configuration from the file system, the letter case may be important. You can get this value in your templates with module. A new module flag (defaults to module below your project). This can also be set with module OS environment variable.  If the module exists, the configuration files will be read and merged on top of each other from left to right; the right-most value will win on duplicates. Given the example tree below: If module is module, the left-most module would be the one directly below the project (this can now be omitted if you want), and then module and finally module. And since these will be merged, you can just provide the environment specific configuration setting in you production config, e.g. module. The order within the directories will be lexical (module and then module). module Some configuration maps support the language code in the filename (e.g. module): module (module also works) and module. Also note that the only folders with ""a meaning"" in the above listing is the top level directories below module. The module sub folder is just added for better organization. We use module in the example above, but Hugo also supports module and module as configuration formats. These can be mixed. Fixes #5422"

2711,Add a consolidated file cache,"This commits reworks how file caching is performed in Hugo. Now there is only one way, and it can be configured. This is the default configuration: module You can override any of these cache setting in your own module. The placeholders explained: module: This is the value of the module config option if set (can also be set via OS env variable module). It will fall back to module on Netlify, or a module directory below the OS temp dir for the others. module: This is the value of the module config option. module is the time in seconds before a cache entry will be evicted, -1 means forever and 0 effectively turns that particular cache off. This means that if you run your builds on Netlify, all caches configured with module will be saved and restored on the next build. For other CI vendors, please read their documentation.

This makes total sense, as it is wasteful and time-consuming to do SASS/SCSS/PostCSS processing for lots of languages when the output is lots of duplicates with different filenames. But since we now output the result once only, this had a negative side effect for multihost setups: We publish the resource once only to the root folder (i.e. not to the language ""domain folder""). This commit removes the language code from the processed image keys. This creates less duplication in the file cache, but it means that you should do a module to clean up stale files. Fixes #5058"

3032,Update Chroma,"And since I have updated Dep locally, I get a bunch of other totally unrelated diffs. Which looks innocent enough. Fixes #5019"
3033,Make resources fetched via resources.Get and similar language agnostic,"With the newly released Hugo Pipes, resources fetched and processed via module and similar was published to the relevant language sub folder when in multilingual mode. The thought behind that was maximum flexibility with support for module per language. In practice this was a bad idea:  You get duplication of identical content, with added processing time You end up with path issues that seem to be hard to find a way around (module is one example)  This commit changes that. Now there is only one module and if you, as one example, need to generate a CSS per langugage, you need to set the paths yourself. Fixes #5017"
3034,tocss/scss: Improve _ prefix handling in SCSS imports,See #5008
3035,Fix file paths for uncached transformed images,"This commit also fixes an existing test to work according to the correct logic. The test was written based on erroneous behavior. We resize the image to 300x200px, and are now trying to fit it within a 50px square. The longest edge is 300 pixels, so we need to divide it by 6 (300 / 50 == 6). And then scale the shortest edge with the same proportion (200 / 6 == 33.33). The original test was transforming the original source image, hence the previous values: 900 x 562 900 / 50 == 18 562 / 18 == 31.22 Fixes #5012"
3036,tpl/partials: Add templates.Exists,Fixes #5010
3037,tpl/partials: Remove superflous loop,No need to check the themes template prefix.
3038,tocss/scss: Improve SCSS project vs themes import resolution,"Before this commit, only SASS/SCSS  components imported from main.scss at first level can be overwritten by homonymous files in projects or over-preceding theme components. This commit fixes that by implementing a custom import resolver which will be tried first. This resolver will make sure that the project/theme hierarchy is always respected. Fixes #5008"

3045,hugolib: Fix .Site.GetPage regression,In Hugo 0.44 we simplified the module API and added code to handle the old-style syntax in most cases. This logic did not handle the lookup of the home page via module and similar. This commit fixes that. Fixes #4989
3046,Add Page.FirstSection,"It was added and then removed by accident some time ago. Let us add it again, as it is useful."
3047,"hugolib: Fix ""borrow content from another language"" issue","If a content file contains shortcode(s), we have logic in place to re-render it per output format. We also have logic in place that avoids making a copy of the content used for this process if we don't need it. This was before this commit limited to server mode and if the page should be output to multiple formats. But there is a third case: If a site (language) borrows and renders module from another language. This would, before this commit, behave oddly for content with shortcodes. Fixes #4986"

3082,Add optional lang as argument to rel/relref,Fixes #4956
3083,Simplify .Site.GetPage etc.,"This commit is a follow up to a recent overhaul of the GetPage/ref/relref implemenation. The most important change in this commit is the update to module:   To reduce the amount of breakage in the wild to its minimum, I have reworked .Site.GetPage with some rules:   We cannot support more than 2 arguments, i.e. .Site.GetPage ""page"" ""posts"" ""mypage.md"" will now throw an error. I think this is the most uncommon syntax and should be OK. It is an easy fix to change the above to .Site.GetPage ""/posts/mypage.md"" or similar.  .Site.GetPage ""home"", .Site.GetPage ""home"" """" and .Site.GetPage ""home"" ""/"" will give you the home page. This means that if you have page in root with the name home.md you need to do .Site.GetPage ""/home.md"" or similar  This commit also fixes some multilingual issues, most notable it is now possible to do cross-language ref/relref lookups by prepending the language code to the path, e.g. module. This commit also reverts the site building tests related to this to ""Hugo 0.44 state"", to get better control of the changes made. Closes #4147 Closes #4727 Closes #4728 Closes #4728 Closes #4726 Closes #4652"
3084,Unify page lookups,"This commit unifies the core internal page index for all page kinds. This enables the module and module shortcodes to support all pages kinds, and adds a new page-relative  module method with simplified signature. See #4147 See #4727 See #4728 See #4728 See #4726 See #4652"

3101,resource: Include the transformation step in the error message,Fixes #4924
3102,media: Only show deprecation warning when needed,Fixes #4927
3103,media: Allow multiple file suffixes per media type,"Before this commit, module on module was used both to set a custom file suffix and as a way to augment the mediatype definition (what you see after the ""+"", e.g. ""image/svg+xml""). This had its limitations. For one, it was only possible with one file extension per MIME type. Now you can specify multiple file suffixes using ""suffixes"", but you need to specify the full MIME type identifier: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""image/svg+xml""] suffixes = [""svg"", ""abc ] In most cases, it will be enough to just change: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""my/custom-mediatype""] suffix = ""txt"" To: [mediaTypes] [mediaTypes.""my/custom-mediatype""] suffixes = [""txt""] Hugo will still respect values set in ""suffix"" if no value for ""suffixes"" is provided, but this will be removed in a future release. Note that you can still get the Media Type's suffix from a template: {{ $mediaType.Suffix }}. But this will now map to the MIME type filename. Fixes #4920"

3131,hugolib: Do not create paginator pages for the other output formats,"This is a recent regression in Hugo, where we have started to produce module when the main output format (usually module) is set up with pagination. For JSON this is potentially lot of superflous work and hurts performance. This commit reinstates the earlier behaviour: We only create paginators if in use in the main output format. And add a test for it to prevent this from happening again. Fixes #4890"
3132,Add Hugo Piper with SCSS support and much more,"Before this commit, you would have to use page bundles to do image processing etc. in Hugo. This commit adds  A new module top-level project or theme dir (configurable via module) A new template func, module which can be used to ""get a resource"" that can be further processed.  This means that you can now do this in your templates (or shortcodes): module This also adds a new module build tag that enables powerful SCSS/SASS support with source maps. To compile this from source, you will also need a C compiler installed: module Note that you can use output of the SCSS processing later in a non-SCSSS-enabled Hugo. The module processor is a Resource transformation step and it can be chained with the many others in a pipeline: module The transformation funcs above have aliases, so it can be shortened to: module A quick tip would be to avoid the fingerprinting part, and possibly also the not-superfast module when you're doing development, as it allows Hugo to be smarter about the rebuilding. Documentation will follow, but have a look at the demo repo in https://github.com/bep/hugo-sass-test New functions to create module objects:  module (see above) module: Create a Resource from a string.  New module transformation funcs:  module: Compile module or module into module. module: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option). module: Currently supports module, module, module, module, module, module. module: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity.. module: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler. module: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template.  Fixes #4381 Fixes #4903 Fixes #4858"

3136,Restrict the new type layout resolution to page and section kinds,Will have to test and evaluate this a little. See  #4891
3137,Consider root and current section's content type if set in front matter,"This should allow for less duplication of templates. Before this commit it was possible to override the content page of a given page/section, but only one page at a time. Full ""template sets"" can now be inherited by setting module etc. in the section content page's front matter, and that type will be considered when looking for layouts for all pages in that section. For nested sections, it will use consider both module set in the current section first, then module set in the first section below home, e.g. module. This commit also adds a new Page method: module. This navigates up to the first section below home (e.g. module). For the home page it will return itself. Fixes #4891"

3180,Add support for theme composition and inheritance,"This commit adds support for theme composition and inheritance in Hugo. With this, it helps thinking about a theme as a set of ordered components: module The theme definition example above in module creates a theme with the 3 components with presedence from left to right. So, Hugo will, for any given file, data entry etc., look first in the project, and then in module, module and lastly module. Hugo uses two different algorithms to merge the filesystems, depending on the file type:  For module and module files, Hugo merges deeply using the translation id and data key inside the files. For module, module (templates) and module files, these are merged on file level. So the left-most file will be chosen.  The name used in the module definition above must match a folder in module, e.g. module. There are  plans to improve on this and get a URL scheme so this can be resolved automatically. Also note that a component that is part of a theme can have its own configuration file, e.g. module. There are currently some restrictions to what a theme component can configure:  module (global and per language) module (global and per language) module and module  The same rules apply here: The left-most param/menu etc. with the same ID will win. There are some hidden and experimental namespace support in the above, which we will work to improve in the future, but theme authors are encouraged to create their own namespaces to avoid naming conflicts. A final note: Themes/components can also have a module definition in their module and similar, which is the ""inheritance"" part of this commit's title. This is currently not supported by the Hugo theme site. We will have to wait for some ""auto dependency"" feature to be implemented for that to happen, but this can be a powerful feature if you want to create your own theme-variant based on others.

3287,Make .Content (almost) always available in shortcodes,"This resolves some surprising behaviour when reading other pages' content from shortcodes. Before this commit, that behaviour was undefined. Note that this has never been an issue from regular templates. It will still not be possible to get the current shortcode's  page's rendered content. That would have impressed Einstein. The new and well defined rules are:  module from a shortcode will be empty. The related module module, module, module, module and module will also have empty values. For other pages (retrieved via module, module etc.) the module is there to use as you please as long as you don't have infinite content recursion in your shortcode/content setup. See below. module is good to go (but does not support shortcodes in headlines; this is unchanged)  If you get into a situation of infinite recursion, the module will be empty. Run module for more information. Fixes #4632 Fixes #4653 Fixes #4655"

The filename: module will be read as Norwegian even if it lives in the English content folder.  The content directories will be merged into a big virtual filesystem with one simple rule: The most specific language file will win. This means that if both module and module exists, they will be considered duplicates and the version inside module will win. Note that translations will be automatically assigned by Hugo by the content file's relative placement, so module will be a translation of module.

3426,hugolib: Extract date and slug from filename,"This commit makes it possible to extract the date from the content filename. Also, the filenames in these cases will make for very poor permalinks, so we will also use the remaining part as the page module if that value is not set in front matter. This should make it easier to move content from Jekyll to Hugo. To enable, put this in your module: module This commit is also a spring cleaning of how the different dates are configured in Hugo. Hugo will check for dates following the configuration from left to right, starting with module etc. So, if you want to use the module, this can be a good configuration: module The current module values for the different dates are module The above will now be the same as: module Note:  We have some built-in aliases to the above: lastmod => modified, publishDate => pubdate, published and expiryDate => unpublishdate. If you want a new configuration for, say, module, you can provide only that line, and the rest will be preserved. All the keywords to the right that does not start with a "":"" maps to front matter parameters, and can be any date param (e.g. module). The keywords to the left are the 4 predefined dates in Hugo, i.e. they are constant values. The current ""special date handlers"" are module and module. We will soon add module to that list.

3522,Fix Docker build,The present Dockerfile in master does not build a Hugo container.

This means that you can now do this: module This is not a breaking change, but the above is a less suprising way of configuring custom params.

3528,command: Remove undraft command,"According to @bep, it is easier to undraft content by editing manually the frontmatter of said content by setting the draft flag to module, or removing it completely, than to rely on the undraft command which is a source of many bugs. Fixes #4353"

3533,create: Provide .Name to the archetype templates,"This value will have a better suited value to base the titles on in your archetype templates when creating bundle ´index.md` type of files. The internal template is updates, but you will have to update any custom archetype template to use the new module variable: ```bash title: ""{{ replace .Name ""-"" "" "" | title }}"" date: {{ .Date }} draft: true  ``` Fixes #4348"
3534,"commands: Deprecate CLI flags canonifyURLs, pluralizeListTitles, preserveTaxonomyNames, uglyURLs",You can of course still set them in site config. Fixes #4347
3535,hugolib: Fix --uglyURLs from comand line regression,This bug was introduced in Hugo 0.33. Fixes #4343
3536,Only set 'url' if permalink in metadata and remove duplicate confirm msg,"The current behaviour addes a module attribute to the frontmatter of all posts imported from Jeklly and assumes the desired permalink structure is /:year/:month/:day/:title/. This may be the case for most peeps, but poses a problem for those that don't use this permalink structure as the module attribute takes precedence over the module attribute in the site-wide configuration meaning it can't be overruled. This changes the behaviour to only set the module attribute if the module attribute is set in the Jekyll frontmatter. The duplication of the confirmation message is also removed. Tests have been updated to reflect this change in behaviour. Fixes #1887"
3537,Fix handling of top-level page bundles,Fixes #4332
3538,tpl/collections: Seed random on init only,
3539,commands: Fix baseURL server regression for multilingual sites,"This was introduced in 6413559f7575e2653d76227a8037a7edbaae82aa a couple of days ago, and demonstrates that we really need better tests for the server/commands package. Fixes #4333"
3540,resource: Start Resources :counter first time they're used,"This is less surprising and more flexible than the original implementation. Given: module Every module in the bundle will have an unique counter, but the module is still allowed to have its specific module. If you change the above example to: module We are talking about two different groups of documents, each with its own counters starting at 1. Fixes #4335"
3541,travis: Re-enable macOS builds,
3542,Update to Go 1.9.3,Fixes #4328
3543,Add a way to disable one or more languages,This commit adds a new config setting: module If this is a multilingual site:  No site for the French language will be created French content pages will be ignored/not read The French language configuration (menus etc.) will also be ignored  This makes it possible to start translating new languages and turn it on when you're happy etc. Fixes #4297 Fixed #4329
3544,"Fix ""date"" page param",Add test coverage for all date type page params that shadow date type page variables. Fixes #4323
3545,Support pages without front matter, Page without front matter now treated same as a page with empty front matter. Test cases added to cover this and repro issue #4320. Type safety of front matter code improved.  Fixes #4320
3546,Add page metadata dates tests,
3547,hugolib: Remove unused code,

3550,Remove and update deprecation status,
3551,output: Remove duplicate layout lookup layouts,"This can happen for sections if Type and Section are equal. Of no real practical difference, but it makes the docs less confusing. Fixes #4319"
3552,hugolib: Add the last lookup variant for the GetPage index,"Now, even for nun-bundles it is possible to do lookup without path or extension. So, given module these lookups will succeed:  module module module module  See #4312 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/307"
3553,github: Shorten the stale setup,
3554,resource: Fix typo in comment,
3555,"hugolib: Simplify bundle lookup via .Site.GetPage, ref, relref",Given a bundle in module all of these will now worK:  module module module module  The last one is potentially ambigous. Fixes #4312
3556,Add a GetPage to the site benchmarks,
3557,Add headless bundle support,"This commit adds  support for module for the module bundle type. So: module In front matter means that  It will have no module and no rendered HTML in /public It will not be part of module etc.  But you can get it by:  module  The use cases are many:  Shared media galleries Reusable page content ""snippets"" ...  Fixes #4311"
3558,Merge matching resources params maps,"This allows setting default params values in the more general resource matchers. I also allows override with more specific values if needed. ```toml [[resources]] src = ""documents/photo_specs.pdf"" title = ""Photo Specifications"" [resources.params] ref = 90564687 icon = ""photo"" [[resources]] src = ""documents/guide.pdf"" title = ""Instruction Guide"" [resources.params] ref = 90564568 [[resources]] src = ""documents/checklist.pdf"" title = ""Document Checklist"" [resources.params] ref = 90564572 [[resources]] src = ""documents/payment.docx"" title = ""Proof of Payment"" [[resources]] src = ""documents/.pdf"" title = ""PDF file"" [resources.params] icon = ""pdf"" [[resources]] src = ""documents/.docx"" title = ""Word document"" [resources.params] icon = ""word"" ``` In the above module example, module will get the module icon, the other pdf files will get the default module icon. Note that in the example above, the order matters: It will take the first value for a given params key, title or name that it finds. Fixes #4315"
3559,Add some general code contribution criterias,
3560,travis: Disable macOS builds for now,Travis have not been able to build those the last week or so.

This should also be more effective, given a fair amount of reuse of the glob patterns: module Fixes #4301"

3591,layout: Respect Type and Layout for list template selection,"This commit also has some other nice side-effects:  The layout logic is unified for all page types, which should make it less surprising Page.Render now supports all types The legacy ""indexes"" type is removed from the template lookup order. This is an undocumented type from early Hugo days. This means that having a template in, say, module will no longer work. The theme override logic is improved. As an example, an module in theme will now wn over a module in the project, which most will expect.  Fixes #3005 Fixes #3245"

3617,hugolib: Fix handling of mixed-case taxonomy folders with content file," We match by path vs taxonomy to determine if we have a content page for that taxonomy The taxonomy name is (if module is not set) normalized to module while you have the disk folder called module. This isn't a new issue, but I suspect most people will just name the folder module and it will just work. The inconsistent behaviour you see here is that you will end up with two pages with the same target filename, so it is a little random who will win.  This fixes that by also normalizing the taxonomy path when doing the comparison. Fixes #4238"

3658,:sparkles: Implement Page bundling and image handling,"This commit is not the smallest in Hugo's history. Some hightlights include:  Page bundles (for complete articles, keeping images and content together etc.). Bundled images can be processed in as many versions/sizes as you need with the three methods module, module and module. Processed images are cached inside module (default) in your project. Symbolic links (both files and dirs) are now allowed anywhere inside /content A new table based build summary The ""Total in nn ms"" now reports the total including the handling of the files inside /static. So if it now reports more than you're used to, it is just more real and probably faster than before (see below).  A site building  benchmark run compared to module shows that this should be slightly faster and use less memory: ```bash ▶ ./benchSite.sh ""TOML,num_langs=.*,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=(500|1000),tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render"" benchmark                                                                                                         old ns/op     new ns/op     delta BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      101785785     78067944      -23.30% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     185481057     149159919     -19.58% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      103149918     85679409      -16.94% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     203515478     169208775     -16.86% benchmark                                                                                                         old allocs     new allocs     delta BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      532464         391539         -26.47% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     1056549        772702         -26.87% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      555974         406630         -26.86% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     1086545        789922         -27.30% benchmark                                                                                                         old bytes     new bytes     delta BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      53243246      43598155      -18.12% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=1,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     105811617     86087116      -18.64% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=500,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4      54558852      44545097      -18.35% BenchmarkSiteBuilding/TOML,num_langs=3,num_root_sections=5,num_pages=1000,tags_per_page=5,shortcodes,render-4     106903858     86978413      -18.64% ``` Fixes #3651 Closes #3158 Fixes #1014 Closes #2021 Fixes #1240 Updates #3757"

3695,Fix broken shortcodes for Ace and Amber,Fixes #4051
3696,hugolib: Fix .IsTranslated  with identical filenames,This commit refines the key used to map translations:  Use module set in front matter Fall back to path + base filename (i.e. the filename without extension and language code)  Note that the Page Kinde will be prepended to both cases above. It does not make sense to have a section as translation for the home page. Fixes #2699

3699,output: Fall back to unstranslated base template,Fixes #3893
3700,Add support for multiple staticDirs,"This commit adds support for multiple statDirs both on the global and language level. A simple module example: ```bash staticDir = [""static1"", ""static2""] [languages] [languages.no] staticDir = [""staticDir_override"", ""static_no""] baseURL = ""https://example.no"" languageName = ""Norsk"" weight = 1 title = ""På norsk"" [languages.en] staticDir2 = ""static_en"" baseURL = ""https://example.com"" languageName = ""English"" weight = 2 title = ""In English"" ``` In the above, with no theme used: the English site will get its static files as a union of ""static1"", ""static2"" and ""static_en"". On file duplicates, the right-most version will win. the Norwegian site will get its static files as a union of ""staticDir_override"" and ""static_no"". This commit also concludes the Multihost support in #4027. Fixes #36 Closes #4027"

3766,Add table linenos support for Chroma highlighter,Fixes #3915
3767,Only re-render the view(s) you're working on,"Hugo already, in its server mode,  support partial rebuilds. To put it simply: If you change module, only that content page is read and processed, then Hugo does some processing (taxonomies etc.) and the full site is rendered. This commit covers the rendering part: We now only re-render the pages you work on, i.e. the last n pages you watched in the browser (which obviously also includes the  page in the example above). To be more specific: When you are running the hugo server in watch (aka. livereload) mode, and change a template or a content file, then we do a partial re-rendering of the following:  The current content page (if it is a content change) The home page Up to the last 10 pages you visited on the site.  This should in most cases be enough, but if you navigate to something completely different, you may see stale content. Doing an edit will then refresh that page. Note that this feature is enabled by default. To turn it off, run module. Fixes #3962 See  #1643"
3768,Make sure Date and PublishDate is always set to a value if one is available,Fixes #3854
3769,Add correct config file name to verbose server log,Server logging uses the wrong variable when displaying the configuration file name. This update changes the log to use the module variable.
3770,metrics: Reset benchmark timer,
3771,metrics: Detect partialCached candidates,"This commit adds a ""cache potential"" column when running module. This is only calculated when module is set, as these calculations has an negative effect on the other timings. This gives a value for partials only, and is a number between 0-100 that indicates if module can be replaced with module. 100 means that all execution of the same partial resulted in the same output. You should do  some manual research before going ""all cache""."

3902,Squashed 'docs/' changes from ef02e34e..35abbc86,"35abbc86 Add example with taxonomy for title template func 85e28c10 Remove comment from variable in front matter example eee8543b Remove comment from variable in front matter example 13a8e0b7 Add missing closing and opening comment tags 83531772 Replace http://example.{com,org}/ with https://example.{com,org}/ 6727d820 Update gh repo for issues in config 3a58818e Add note to install Testify 19f13e61 Fix YAML examples in taxonomies.md dc4b90db Replace old RSS template with new embedded version (#116) 00f39bd7 camelCase output format options 902a14a1 Add missing word to pretty URLs explanation git-subtree-dir: docs git-subtree-split: 35abbc869199b852922c024a29e2370272a7c1c8"
3903,releaser: Include stats from hugoDocs,Fixes #3727
3904,helpers: Remove some unused funcs,
3905,Add some missing doc comments,"As pointed out by the linter, some exported functions and types are missing doc comments. The linter warnings have been reduced from 194 to 116. Not all missing comments have been added in this commit though."
3906,Remove sourceRelativeLinks,Fixes #3766
3907,helpers: Fix broken TaskList in Markdown,"As per the referenced issue, if the task list in Markdown has nothing before it, it will be rendered wrongly: ``` title: ""My First Post"" date: 2017-07-29T20:21:57+02:00 draft: true   [ ] TaskList  ``` is rendered as: ```  class=""task-list""  TaskList  ``` The problem lies in the module function of module, it had a hardocded index of module for the first module of the list, it is used to insert the class into the text before the closing bracket, but that hardcoded index is only right when there is a newline before the opening bracket, which is the case when there is anything in the document before the task list, but if there is nothing, then there is no newline, and the correct index of the first module will be module. To fix that we're changing the hardcoded index to be dynamic by using module to find it properly. We're also adding a test case to make sure this is tested against. Fixes #3710"
3908,Switch from fork bep/inflect to markbates/inflect,Original package has received updates the fork hasn't. Without fork updates are easier to maintain.
3909,Make the title case style guide configurable,This works for the module func and the other places where Hugo makes title case.  AP style (new default) Chicago style Go style (what we have today)  Fixes #989

If module is used in the arcetype template, the site is built and added to the template context. Note that this may be potentially time consuming for big sites. A more complete example would then be for the section module and the archetype file module: ``` title: ""{{ replace .TranslationBaseName ""-"" "" "" | title }}"" date: {{ .Date }} tags: - x categories: - x draft: true  more {{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages ""Type"" ""cool"" ) }} * {{ .Title }} {{ end }} ``` And then create a new post with: module Hot Tip: If you set the module configuration variable to an editor on your module, the newly created article will be opened. The above newsletter type archetype illustrates the possibilities: The full Hugo module and all of Hugo's template funcs can be used in the archetype file. Fixes #1629"
4033,create: Use archetype template as-is as a Go template,"This commit removes the fragile front matter decoding, and takes the provided archetype file as-is and processes it as a template. This also means that we no longer will attempt to fill in default values for module and module. The upside is that it is now easy to create these values in a dynamic way: module You can currently use all of Hugo's template funcs, but the data context is currently very shallow:  module gives the archetype kind provided module gives the target file name without extension. module gives the target file name module gives the current time as RFC3339 formatted string  The above  will probably be extended in #1629.

Note that for the top level folder there will be a potential name conflict with a module module (if enabled) This issue will not be relevant for subfolders in sections Hugo will soon add support for nested sections, but we will have to find a way to separate them from the rest (module maybe).

Ambiguous types will fall back to HTML. Partials inherits the text vs HTML identificator of the container template. This also means that plain text templates can only include plain text partials.

Then the content is written to destination.  One could argue that it is the last bullet that is the actual core responsibility. This commit fixes that by moving the module-related logic where it belong, and simplify the code, i.e. remove the abstractions.

The desired behavior is that .Truncated would evaluate to false when there was nothing after the user defined summary marker. This also adds a simple unit test to ensure that this feature isn't broken again.  The check for content after the user defined summary marker is done on the raw content instead of the working copy because some of the markup renderers add elements after the marker, making it difficult to determine if there is actually any content.

Prior to this fix, you could create your own RSS feed to override the default limit of 15, but we still had a hardcoded limit of 50 items set in module. With this option in place, the module logic is no longer hardcoded into the embedded RSS template. Because the size of the slice passed to the template is now limited to rssLimit instead of 50, this commit is a breaking change for sites with a custom RSS template that expects more than 15 items.

This is very confusing for users and one of the most common support questions on the forum.

But that doesn't help with direct template lookups of type module. This commit solves that by doing some carefully crafted modifications of the templates' AST -- lowercasing the params keys. This is low-level work, but it's not like the template API wil change -- and this is important enough to defend such ""bit fiddling"". Tests are added for all the template engines: Go templates, Ace and Amber. Fixes #2615 Fixes #1129 Fixes #2590"

This is low-level work, but it's not like the template API wil change -- and this is important enough to defend such ""bit fiddling"". Tests are added for all the template engines: Go templates, Ace and Amber. Fixes #2615 Fixes #1129 Fixes #2590"

While this is mostly a good thing, as you don't need to know the original casing to look up a value, it will be breaking for people doing direct lookups in the ´Site.Params` map. We will try to find a solution to this ""breakage"", but the recommended method to get params values is via the module methods. This method is now implemented on module, module and module and is case-insensitive:  Use module if you want page param with fall back to site param if not found on page. Use module to get a site param  See #2590"

This commit fixes this by doing a two-step check:  Check if ""/mysites/site/content/mypost2.md"" is within /mysites/site/content Check if  ""/mysites/site/content/mypost2.md"" is within the real path that /mysites/site/content points to  Fixes #2265 Closes #2273"

This commit also adds two new template funcs: relLangURL and absLangURL. See #2309"
5038,Make it possible to configure Blackfroday per language,See #2309
5039,Make it possible to add a language in server mode,See #2309

5042,Make taxonomies configurable per language,See #2312
5043,Make the config loading testable,"This is needed to verify  #2309, but it closes a big hole in Hugo's automated tests. The loading of the config is now moved to module and the same default settings are now used in production and tests. As Viper now uses Afero as its filesystem, we now can write fairly complete integration tests with ease. See #2309"
5044,Add sitemap index for multilingual sites,See #2309
5045,Redirect to main language from root,See #2312 See #2309
5046,Rework the multilingual docs,And in the same go adjusted some minor parts of the language API: Add LanguagePrefix alias to Node and rename the Multilingual config section to Languages. See #2309
5047,Render the shortcodes as late as possible,"This is needed to make shortcode users happy with the new multilanguage support, but it will also solve many other related posts about ""stuff not available in the shortcode"". We will have to revisit this re the handler chain at some point, but that will be easier now as the integration test story has improved so much. As part of this commit, the site-building tests in page_test.go is refreshed, they now tests for all the rendering engines (when available), and all of them now uses the same code-path as used in production. Fixes #1229 Fixes #2323 Fixes ##1076"
5048,Optimize the multilanguage build process,"Work In Progress! This commit makes a rework of the build and rebuild process to better suit a multi-site setup. This also includes a complete overhaul of the site tests. Previous these were a messy mix that were testing just small parts of the build chain, some of it testing code-paths not even used in ""real life"". Now all tests that depends on a built site follows the same and real production code path. See #2309 Closes #2211 Closes #477 Closes #1744"

5050,Move HugoSites to hugolib,It will get more involved in the build process in a minute. See #2309
5051,Add Translations and AllTranslations to Node,"This commit also consolidates URLs on Node vs Page, so now .Permalink should be interoperable. Note that this implementations should be fairly short-livded, waiting for #2297, but the API should be stable."
5052,Rework the i18n template func handling,"Setting the language to use when loading the language bundles just doesn't work. The template system is unfortanetely a global, and the last languate processed won ..."
5053,Introduce HugoSites type,"And a Hugo global variable which contains the site under build. This is really needed to get some level of control of the ""multiple languages"" in play. There are still work related to this scattered around, but that will come. With this commit, the multilingual feature is starting to work."
5054,Reset translation slice on rebuild,"Also add all translations, including the current, to the slice. We filter later."
5055,Rename MainSites to Sites,Having many main sites doesn't make much sense.
5056,Add Translations and AllTranslations methods to Page,Will revisit Node later.

Adds a couple of variables useful for multilingual sites Adds documentation (content/multilingual.md) Added language prefixing for all URL generation/permalinking see in the code base. Implements i18n. Leverages the great github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n lib.. thanks Nick. * Adds ""i18n"" and ""T"" template functions.."

5100,tpl: Add time template func ,Fixes #2328
5101,Fix for meminterval not using specified interval,Hugo seems to ignore the meminterval I specify and always uses it's default of 100ms. This seems to be because Hugo tries to take the meminterval from the command line (an Int) and converts it to a String and passes it to time.ParseDuration. If you pass a different meminterval (such as module as above) it will fail (time.ParseDuration requires some units) and use the default instead. Changed module to be a String and added better documentation for valid time units. Resolves: #2325

In some situations, specially with older Mac's (using a Late 2008 Macbook), the events we receive might be aggregated.

5357,Add readFile template func,"This also includes a refactor of the hugofs package and its usage. The motivation for that is: The Afero filesystems are brilliant. Hugo's way of adding a dozen of global variables for the different filesystems was a mistake. In readFile (and also in some other places in Hugo today) we need a way to restrict the access inside the working dir. We could use ioutil.ReadFile and implement the path checking, checking the base path and the dots ("".."") etc. But it is obviously better to use an Afero BasePathFs combined witha ReadOnlyFs. We could create a use-once-filesystem and handle the initialization ourselves, but since this is also useful to others and the initialization depends on some other global state (which would mean to create a new file system on every invocation), we might as well do it properly and encapsulate the predefined set of filesystems. This change also leads the way, if needed, to encapsulate the file systems in a struct, making it possible to have several file system sets in action at once (parallel multilanguage site building? With Moore's law and all...) Fixes #1551"

This fixes the bug where ""hugo --watch"" could only reload config.toml once before it gets stuck for good at livereload.ForceRefresh(). This is also consistent with Hugo's existing behaviour: Non-server ""hugo --watch"" has never injected livereload.js since the inception of the ""watch"" feature in Hugo v0.12."

5842,Do not rebuild on extra Spotlight filesystem events,"Write and rename operations are often followed by CHMOD. There may be valid use cases for rebuilding the site on CHMOD, but that will require more complex logic than this simple conditional. On OS X this seems to be related to Spotlight, see: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/15 A workaround is to put your site(s) on the Spotlight exception list, but that may be a little mysterious for most end users. So, for now, we skip reload on CHMOD. This small commit will be a 100% improvement for most OS X-users. Fixes #1587"

This setting comes from jekyll and eases the transition to hugo greatly. We leave it undocumented so that folks don't rely on it, but also don't shoot themselves in the foot during a jekyll migration.

6001,Use LazyFileReader for reading file contents,"Simple ioutil.ReadFile is used for reading file contents but it reads all of the file contents and copies them into the memory and is run in a single goroutine. It causes much memory consumption at copying media files in content directory to publish directory and it is not good at performance. This improves the both issue by replacing ReadFile with LazyFileReader. It postpones reading the file contents until it is really needed. As the result, actual file read is run in parallelized goroutine. It improves performance especially in a really big site. In addition, if this reader is called from io.Copy, it does not copy the file contents into the memory but just copies them into destination file. It improves much memory consumption issue when the site has many media files. Fix #1181"

Resize them all to 600x400 (pixels), and use the module suffix. When necessary, the website snapshot is re-captured using gnome-web-photo.  Then, the following commands (or a combination thereof) are used to crop and resize the image into a thumbnail, and to reduce its filesize: module"

6029,Also rename readDir in docs shortcode,
6030,Rename ReadDir to readDir,To make it consistent with the other template funcs.
6031,Make sort tpl func accept field/key chaining arg,"'sort' template function used to accept only each element's struct field name, method name and map key name as its second argument. This extends it to accept a field/method/key chaining key string like 'Params.foo.bar' as the argument. It evaluates sub elements of each array or map elements and sorts by them. Typical use case would be sorting pages by user defined front matter value. For example, sorting pages by 'Params.foo.bar' is possible by writing the following template code module It ignores all leading and trailing dots so ""Params.foo.bar"" can be written in "".Params.foo.bar"" This also fixes the issue that 'sort' cannot evaluate a pointer value. Fix #1330"
6032,Fix sort tpl func to return explicit type value,"sort template function returns module type slice value regardless of its original element type. This fixes it to keep the original element type. For example, if it sorts module type value, it returns module slice value instead of module slice value."

6045,Fix searching YAML/TOML delimiters in frontmatter,"When a YAML/TOML's delimiter character sequence is included in a frontmatter string, parser mistakes it as a delimiter.

6046,Add map support to scratch,
6047,Trim trailing spaces from YAML and TOML delimiters,"When someone hits space after typing ""---"" (or ""+++"") but before they hit return, hugo silently failed to parse the file. This corrects that."

This is, not surprisingly, also faster: ``` benchmark                           old ns/op     new ns/op     delta BenchmarkSortByWeightAndReverse     14228         491           -96.55% benchmark                           old allocs     new allocs     delta BenchmarkSortByWeightAndReverse     1              0              -100.00% benchmark                           old bytes     new bytes     delta BenchmarkSortByWeightAndReverse     32            0             -100.00% ``` Fixes #1293"

6091,Change arianv sourceLink to master branch,
6092,Add learnoverpass,
6093,Add arianv,
6094,add a showcase of sa.muel.be,
6095,[Docs] Press page. Fix URL,
6096,Add support for GitHub-flavoured markdown code fences for highlighting,"This commit adds a new PygmentsCodeFences config option (default false), which if true will allow GitHub style backtick code fences around code, which will then be rendered by Pygments. For example: module can be used instead of {{< highlight language >}}your code {{< /highlight >}}. Fixes #362"
6097,"If no language is provided to Pygments, then try and guess it","Previously if no language was specified, then illegal args would be passed to pygments, for example module, which would result in pygments printing an error."
6098,Add a showcase of Kangkona,
6099,Add how-to for foreign language month names,"FYI @nicolinuxfr, added the month name example."
6100,Add Rick and eSolia's sites to the Hugo docs showcase,
6101,"Added missing ""Social"" section to SiteInfo","I could be wrong here, but it looks to me like .Site.Social.facebook is used in tpl/template_embedded.go, but the variable is never set. I've added a line to initializeSiteInfo to map the info from config into this variable."
6102,Document Page.RawContent in templates/variables/,
6103,Add Page.RawContent() to access raw Markdown as a string.,"In particular, RawContent() excludes the metadata header. This is necessary in the use case of embedding remarkjs.com slides, as it needs the unprocessed Markdown content to generate the slides."
6104,Add nil comparison to where tpl function,"module template function's internal condition check function always returns module when a target value doesn't exist or it's nil value but this behavior makes it difficult to filter values which doesn't have a particular parameter. To solve it, this adds nil value comparison to the function. module like clause can be used for the case above. Only ""="", ""=="", ""eq"", ""!="", ""<>"", ""ne"" operators are allowed to be used with module. If an other operator is passed with module, the condition check function returns module like before. Fix #1232"
6105,Fix watcher detecting changes as static when no theme,"There have been some changes to the ´helpers.GetThemesDirPath()´ so it now returns an empty string when no theme. This is correct, but it broke the watch service (at lest on OSX), as `strings.HasPrefix("""", ""somestring"") evaluates to true somehow, and content changes are incorrectly branded as static. There are other issues in there, but that will come later ... See #1236"
6106,Add doc for new Blackfriday options,See #1220 See #1231
6107,Add config option for Blackfriday HTML_HREF_TARGET_BLANK,Fixes #1220

6113,Use helpers.GetThemeDir() to find base templates.,"Now that we have the helpers.GetThemeDir() function, use it instead of calling directly into viper."
6114,Refactor theme path helper functions.,"Reduce duplication (module a few lines away from module) and add a module function to get the current theme's directory. Also add a comment complaining about the module function, which doesn't seem to do what its name would suggest. This might be a candidate for deprecation?"
6115,Add support for baseof.ace templates in themes.,"When we find a template that requires a base template, we should also look for that base template in the current theme. Fixes #1215."
6116,Proper parsing structured array from yaml based FrontMatter,
6117,Use pooled buffer in replaceShortcodes,"Even as a copy at the end is needed, this consumes way less memory on Go 1.4.2: ```benchmark                           old ns/op     new ns/op     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  145979        139964        -4.12% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     633574        631946        -0.26% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             195842        187938        -4.04% benchmark                           old allocs     new allocs     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  87             87             +0.00% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     9424           9415           -0.10% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             274            274            +0.00% benchmark                           old bytes     new bytes     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  141830        141830        +0.00% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     35219         25385         -27.92% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             30178         30177         -0.00% ``` See #1148"

6121,Print URL when failing menu test,See #1222
6122,Remove unused var,
6123,Remove superfluous p-tags around shortcodes,This commit replaces the regexp driven module with a handwritten one. It wasnt't possible to handle the p-tags case without breaking performance. This fix actually improves in that area: ``` benchmark                           old ns/op     new ns/op     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  142738        142667        -0.05% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     665590        575645        -13.51% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             176038        181074        +2.86% benchmark                           old allocs     new allocs     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  87             87             +0.00% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     9631           9424           -2.15% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             274            274            +0.00% benchmark                           old bytes     new bytes     delta BenchmarkParsePage                  141830        141830        +0.00% BenchmarkReplaceShortcodeTokens     52275         35219         -32.63% BenchmarkShortcodeLexer             30177         30178         +0.00% ``` Fixes #1148

6150,Temp remove tip from Travis,There is one failing test there. It runs fine for me on tip locally (Linux). Will reinsert this once tip gets into stable mode.
6151,Fix substr tpl func's int type variant issue,"module template function takes one or two range arguments. Both arguments must be int type values but if it is used with a calclation function e.g. module, module etc, it causes a wrong type error. This fixes the issue to allow the function to take other integer type variant like module etc. This also includes a small fix on no range argument case. Fix #1190"
6152,Silence chatty JSON test,
6153,Add some tests for IgnoreFiles,And log error on invalid regexp. See #1189
6154,Add some docs for IgnoreFiles,See #1189

6157,GetJSON/GetCSV: Add retry on invalid content,The retry gets triggered when the parsing of the content fails. Fixes #1166
6158,Add PreserveTaxonomyNames flag,"Before this commit, taxonomy names were hyphenated, lower-cased and normalized -- then fixed and titleized on the archive page. So what you entered in the front matter isn't necessarily what you got in the final site. To preserve backwards compability, module is default module. Setting it to module will preserve what you type (the first characters is made toupper for titles), but normalized in URLs. This also means that, if you manually construct URLs to the archive pages, you will have to pass the Taxonomy names through the module func. Fixes #1180"
6159,Remove accents in URLs,"So the taxonomy module gives paths on the form module. Unfortunately this introduces two imports from the module, but Unicode-normalization isn't something we'd want to write from scratch. See https://blog.golang.org/normalization See #1180"
6160,Fix FullFilePath,Fixes #732

6165,Extract Ace handling to a method,To prepare for some testing. See #1178
6166,Support module section,"Section names are also used as the title of the list pages, but naming section folders as module and similar didn't work very well. This commit fixes that. This commit also changes the title casing of the section titles. Some may argue that this is a breaking change, but the old behaviour was also pretty broken, even for languages that use title capitalizations, as it didn't follow any particular style guide, module became module etc. Now it just turns the first letter into upper case, so module will be left as module. People wanting the good old behaviour can use the module template func. Fixes #1176"
6167,Add IsHome,"To determine if a page is the ""Home Page"" has inspired lots of creativity in the template department. This commit makes it simpler: IsHome will tell the truth."

6172,Make deprecated warning for this release more alert,
6173,Hyphenate DEV version,
6174,Add module type support to module tpl func,"module tpl function doesn't support module type so if people want to compare such values, it's required that these values are converted into module and compare them. This improves it. If module values are passed to module, it converts them into module internally, compares them and returns the result.

6223,Edit docs extras syntax highlighting.md,"Added a bunch of clarifying narrative, looking at the discussion forum for what people are asking about, and what I myself was confused about.  clearer separation of advantage of each style - server or client side - at the top inconsistent newlines (different column widths) so I just removed them from obvious paragraphs added that the highlight shortcode is not used for the client-side javascripts Hugo is taking crap for Pygments being slow, so tried to emphasize that's it's in Pygment's lap. I got your back, Hugo. On client-side added prism example More clarity on how the css and js needs to be added to your templates Explained how the client-side scripts work"
6224,Add support for URLs relative to context root,"Setting module to module will make all relative URLs in the site really relative. And will do so with speed. So: In module: module becomes module The same in module will become: module etc. Note that absolute URLs will not be touched (either external resources, or URLs constructed with module). The speediness is about the same as before: ``` benchmark                    old ns/op     new ns/op     delta BenchmarkAbsURL              17462         18164         +4.02% BenchmarkAbsURLSrcset        18842         19632         +4.19% BenchmarkXMLAbsURLSrcset     18643         19313         +3.59% BenchmarkXMLAbsURL           9283          9656          +4.02% benchmark                    old allocs     new allocs     delta BenchmarkAbsURL              24             28             +16.67% BenchmarkAbsURLSrcset        29             32             +10.34% BenchmarkXMLAbsURLSrcset     27             30             +11.11% BenchmarkXMLAbsURL           12             14             +16.67% benchmark                    old bytes     new bytes     delta BenchmarkAbsURL              3154          3404          +7.93% BenchmarkAbsURLSrcset        2376          2573          +8.29% BenchmarkXMLAbsURLSrcset     2569          2763          +7.55% BenchmarkXMLAbsURL           1888          1998          +5.83% ``` Fixes #1104 Fixes #622 Fixes #937 Fixes #157"
6225,Edits to templates/404.md,"Added bit about how the 404.html page has to be set to load automatically - auto on Github but needs config on other web servers. Also tweaked the text a little to emphasize it's a node type, and explain a little more about where the 404 template should be saved."

6229,Add convenience script to run benchmarks,
6230,Only uglify 404.html on server root,"module needs to be that and not module in the root. There seem to be content pages in the wild with the name module (Hugo docs), so this commit adds an extra check so only root 404 pages ignore the modulesetting. Fixes #1140"

6251,Update test logs for uniformity and consistency,"Many minor fixes to make test logs more consistent and correct a mispelling. Standardize on ""[%i] got X but expected Y"" for log messages. Using a consistent layout makes it easier to read the test results. This was mostly changing ""Got"" to ""got"". Swapped the order of values on several calls to bring them in line with the convention. A few log messages had a sequence number added to identify the exact scenario that failed. Otherwise, there would be no way to ascertain which failed When there are many scenarios. Correct spelling of ""expected."" Fixes #1028 Merged be2097e1ad789eca5d893805a059d94defbe5c48 [close #1040]"

This commit adds a new option moduleblogpage.HasMenuCurrent ""sectionmenu"" $sectionmenuitem` will return true.

I figured I'd make myself useful and add the reference to the index function, on the go template primer page. Also, I moved the reference links to the bottom. A general comment: as good as these docs are, the primer at this point makes some assumptions about audience knowledge, so some might find it lacking. Once I understand better, I might make some more clarifying edits."

Some folders are named specifically to work a certain way with hugo, but although the examples use key functional section and taxonomy names like post and tag, it does not matter what they are called. Hopefully this will help other newbs."

6317,Document getenv template function,Add module to the template function documentation.
6318,Add a section comparing the 'build' and 'server',One of the first things that new users have to understand is the difference between Hugo as a web server and Hugo as a web site generator. Issue #852 asked for documentation to make that clear. This patch updates the overview page with that information. It will seem repetitive to users that understand the difference. Weigh that against the needs of those that don't. Reference #852

6367,More initialism corrections (golint),"Thanks to @bep's new, brilliant helpers.Deprecated() function, the following functions or variables are transitioned to their new names, preserving backward compatibility for v0.14 and warning the user of upcoming obsolescence in v0.15:  .Url → .URL (for node, menu and paginator) .Site.BaseUrl → .Site.BaseURL .Site.Indexes → .Site.Taxonomies .Site.Recent → .Site.Pages getJson → getJSON getCsv → getCSV safeHtml → safeHTML safeCss → safeCSS safeUrl → safeURL  Also fix related initialisms in strings and comments.

6376,Add Seq template func,Very similar to GNU's seq. Fixes #552 Conflicts:     tpl/template.go
6377,Experimental AsciiDoc support with external helpers,"See #470   Based on existing support for reStructuredText files   Handles content files with extensions module and module   Pipes content through module.    If module is not installed, then module.   To make sure module or module is found, after adding    a piece of AsciiDoc content, run module with the module flag    and look for this message: module   Caveats:   The final ""Last updated"" timestamp is currently not stripped.   When module is run with module, you may see a lot of these messages module   if you have lots of module, module or module files.  Some versions of module may have trouble with its safe mode.    To test if you are affected, try this:module   If so, I recommend that you install module instead. Feedback and patches welcome! Ideally, we should be using https://github.com/VonC/asciidocgo, @VonC's wonderful Go implementation of Asciidoctor.  However, there is still a bit of work needed for asciidocgo to expose its API so that Hugo can actually use it. Until then, hope this ""experimental AsciiDoc support through external helpers"" can serve as a stopgap solution for our community. :-) 2015-01-30: Updated for the replaceShortcodeTokens() syntax change 2015-02-21: Add module extension as suggested by @Fale Conflicts:     helpers/content.go"

Also:  - Clarify that, after using module, the bare module command    need to be run before deployment.  - Add a section on running module as production web server,    and add links to two blog posts of two Hugo users sharing    their experience. Partially fixes: #852 and #937"
6383,Update press coverage: Fix URL; new tutorial in Chinese,
6384,Remove trailing space from site build statistics,
6385,Correct initialisms as suggested by golint,"First step to use initialisms that golint suggests, for example: module as see on http://goreportcard.com/report/spf13/hugo Thanks to @bep for the idea! Note that command-line flags (cobra and pflag) as well as struct fields like .BaseUrl and .Url that are used in Go HTML templates need more work to maintain backward-compatibility, and thus are NOT yet dealt with in this commit. First step in fixing #959."
6386,doArithmetic: add test for division by zero,
6387,Add some basic tests for doArithmetic,We might have to take precision into account for floating point nubers ... at some point.
6388,Skip directories like node_modules from the watchlist,"A local module directory can easily contain tens of thousands of files, easily exhausting the tiny default max open files limit especially on OS X Yosemite, in spite of the fact that  Hugo already had code in place since February 2014 to try to raise the maxfiles ulimit. Also skip module and module directories. The file watching situation will improve when https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents become ready, but until then, we will be thrifty.  :-) Thanks to @chibicode for the suggestion. See #168 for continued discussions."

6442,Adapt to relative path bug fix in purell,"Temporary workaround for the bug fix and resulting behavioral change in purell.NormalizeURLString(): a leading '/' was inadvertently to relative links, but no longer, see #878. I think the real solution is to allow Hugo to make relative URL with relative path, e.g. ""../../post/hello-again/"", as wished by users in issues #157, #622, etc., without forcing relative URLs to begin with '/'. Once the fixes are in, let's remove this kludge and restore SanitizeUrl() to the way it was. Fixes #878"

6458,Expansion of unit tests for utils/utils.go,"This commit expands the test coverage for the utils/utils.go module. The utils module uses the 'github.com/spf13/jwalterweatherman' (aka jww) package for logging. The tests take the approach of examining the log file that is produced by this module to verify correct behaviour. This avoids refactoring the utils module. The log file messages written by the jww module are of the form: : yyyy/mm/dd  The checkLogFile function checks each of these parts in turn except for the date string, which is currently ignored. The final part of the log file format can either be a single error message, or a series of strings followed by an error message. Both the error message and the series of strings can be empty strings. The log file is checked using a combination of the regex package, along with the bufio scanner type. Each test logs to its own temporary log file. This is achieved with standard test setup and teardown functions. One consequence of these tests is that StopOnErr has been refactored into call a new unexported function doStopOnErr which contains the bulk of the original logic. This allows the same testing approach to be used with StopOnErr as with CheckErr and cutUsageMessage, rather than look at the exit status code of the test itself. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the author of the tests must now know if a log file is expected or not. If doStopOnErr determines that an empty error message would be written to the log file then nothing is written. In the context of the tests this means that the log file created by the test would have no contents. Consequently there would be nothing for the test to examine. This situation is indicated by the boolean flag logFileExoected in the testData struct, and processed by the logFileIsExpectedAndValid function. Although not ideal this was deemed a reasonable compromise."

This is to avoid things like module and module showing up in index.xml (RSS) and sitemap.xml. Pipe dates with ±hh:mm time zone through module to prevent the module sign from turning into module. Also make some shuffling to avoid blank lines in the output.

Once the backslashes were added, I discovered that the JSON sent to livereload was invalid and failed to work because it had backslashes. Hence the code to replace the backslashes from the path to make them work in JSON and for the URL. With this fix, changes to a stylesheet are shown on the page, and if it's a single file that changed, it's reflected in the browser without reloading the whole page."
6530,"[Docs] Complete the transition from ""indexes"" to ""taxonomies"" (almost)",Also mention module → module as well as the upcoming module → module transitions.

6536,Version uses binary name instead of hugo,On Windows the binary name is hugo.exe and running hugo version results in this error:     GetFileAttributesEx D:\Dev\Go\gopath\bin\hugo: The system cannot find the file specified. This fixes that error and allows the binary name to be something other than hugo on any OS.
6537,Added three videos to documentation.,Created shortcode for YouTube videos and made the videos responsive in the stylesheet.

6551,Add pagination to release notes,
6552,"Add pagination support for home page, sections and taxonomies","Two new configuration properties, module (default module) and module (default module) are added. Setting module to a positive value will split the list pages for the home page, sections and taxonomies into chunks of size of the module property. A module is provided to help building a pager menu. There are two ways to configure a module:  The simplest way is just to call module from a template. It will contain the pages for ""that page"" (module will (like today) contain all the pages). Select a sub-set of the pages with the available template functions and pass the slice to module : module  NOTE: For a given Node, it's one of the options above. It's perfectly legitimate to iterate over the same pager more than once, but it's static and cannot change. The module contains enough information to build a full-blown paginator interface. The pages are built on the form (note: BLANK means no value, i.e. home page): module Fixes #96"
6553,Add site-wide/per-page [blackfriday] module option,
6554,Wrong URL for Github Pages,
6555,Move s.prepUrl() before prepending BaseUrl.,"When we have an absolute menu url specified in the config file (e.g., module), its menu entry is generated by prefixing it with the BaseUrl. The result is then run through prepUrl(), which uses helpers.Urlize to convert urls such as 'My First Link' to 'my-first-link'. The behaviour is backwards: we do not want to run helpers.Urlize on the BaseUrl, only on the absolute component. Currently, a BaseUrl such as 'http://my.edu/ENG101' will be converted to 'http://my.edu/eng101', resulting in broken links in all of my menus. This commit switches the URL prep and BaseUrl prepending actions around. I would argue that these URLs shouldn't be run through prepUrl anyway because the site developer has specified them explicitly in a config file and might be surprised for, e.g., URLs to change case, but that's another commit for another time."
6556,Correct wercker URL,
6557,Fix inverse notation,
6558,Make Blackfriday smart fractions to really default to module,"Fix my own bug in Pull Request #829, commit eb686352b1785844778e1cba8c69b85079e3044f"
6559,Add site-wide/per-page [blackfriday] module option,Make Blackfriday's module option user-configurable.  Defaults to module as before.  See discussions at: http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/any-way-to-disable-smart-fractions/328 Thanks to @bjornerik and @spf13 for laying the groundwork making it easy to expose Blackfriday's underlying configurable options.
6560,Fix for page.GetParam() for JSON and TOML maps,"Setting per-page Blackfriday angledQuotes did not work with TOML or JSON front matter, but it does work with YAML. It turns out that page.Params(""blackfriday"") returns type map[interface{}]interface{} for YAML, but type map[string]interface{} for JSON and TOML. This patch updates page.GetParam() to catch the latter, with an error message if page.GetParam() does not recognize a type.  A test is also added."
6561,Upgrade from gopkg.in/yaml.v1 to gopkg.in/yaml.v2,
6562,Handle empty front matter in archetype.,"If an archetype has deliberately empty front matter (e.g., to suppress generation of the 'draft' field or to force a particular front matter type instead of the default TOML), we should handle it gracefully rather than panic (""assignment to entry in nil map"")."
6563,[Docs]: Add new press/blog coverage about Hugo,
6564,Fix RelPermalink() and Urls in menus vs canonifyUrls,"canonifyUrls=true, RelPermalink and baseUrl with sub-path did not work. This fixes that by adding a check for canonifyUrl=trues=true in RelPermalink(). So given  baseUrl ""http://somehost.com/sub/"" the path ""some-path/file.html""  For canonifyUrls=false RelPermalink() returns ""/sub/some-path/file.html"" For canonifyUrls=true RelPermalink() returns ""/some-path/file.html"" In the last case, the Url will be made absolute and clickable in a later step. This commit also makes the menu urls defined in site config releative. To make them work with canonifying of urls, the context root is prepended if canonifying is turned off. Fixes #519 Fixes #711"

6573,Cache the page's rendering context flags,"This map can potentially be used many times for a given page, and altough the cost of re-creating the map should be minimal, caching it is simple -- and could save some GC and CPU cycles."
6574,Register rstHandler to restore experimental reST support,"(Experimental) reStructuredText support was working in v0.12, but was no longer handled after some refactoring in v0.13-DEV. That experimental support is now restored. Furthermore, check for both rst2html and rst2html.py in the PATH, and execute whichever is found. See #472 for more information."

This extends it to accept dot chaining key like 'Params.foo.bar' as the argument. It evaluates sub elements of each array elements and checks it matches the third argument value. Typical use case would be for filtering Pages by user defined front matter value. For example, to filter pages which have 'Params.foo.bar' and its value is 'baz', it is used like module It ignores all leading and trailing dots so it can also be used with "".Params.foo.bar"""

6686,Add configurable support for angled quotes,"The flag module was added to Blackfriday on Black Friday. This configures rendering of double quotes as angled left and right quotes (« »). Typical use cases would be either or, or combined, but never in the same document. As an example would be a person from Norway; he has a blog in both English and Norwegian (his native tongue); he would then configure Blackfriday to use angled quotes for the Norwegian section, but keep them as reqular double quotes for the English. This commit adds configuration support for this new flag, configuration that can be set in the site configuration, but overridden in page front matter. Fixes #605"
6687,Fix unicode menu URLs,"Menu urls like /categories/новости-проекта would turn into /categories/d0bdd0bed0b2d0bed181d182d0b8-d0bfd180d0bed0b5d0bad182d0b0, which is illegal, while the directory under the categories/ is created with the original name.

6696,Documentation for module and module., Rejigged the weight of the extras/ content for the new crossreferences   page. Used the new {{*…*/}} format for documenting highlighting and to   prevent a warning about the missing module shortcode.
6697,Provide (relative) reference funcs & shortcodes.,"  module and module take a reference (the logical filename for a     page, including extension and/or a document fragment ID) and return     a permalink (or relative permalink) to the referenced document.  If the reference is a page name (such as module), the page     will be discovered and the permalink will be returned: module If the reference is a page name with a fragment (such as     module), the page will be discovered and used to add the     module to the resulting fragment and permalink:     module. If the reference is a fragment and module has been called from     a module or module, it will be returned as is: module. If the reference is a fragment and module has been called from     a module, it will be returned with the page’s unique ID:     module.    module can be called from either module, module (e.g.,     module), module objects, or module objects in     templates.   module cannot be used in content, so two shortcodes have been     created to provide the functionality to content: module and module.     These are intended to be used within markup, like module or module.   There are also module and module template functions (used to create     the shortcodes) that expect a module or module object and the     reference string (e.g., module or module). It actually looks for module as defined on     module or module objects.   Shortcode handling had to use a differently unique wrapper in     module because of the way that the module and     module are intended to be used in content. "

6725,update summary.md with info on handling of html tags,
6726,Enable descriptive header IDs.,Enable blackfriday.EXTENSION_AUTO_HEADER_IDS to generate the name of the header ID from the text in the header. Works for prefix and underline headers.  TOC extraction had to be modified to look for module>   instead of module because of this change. Fixed a number of tests that depended on the presence of module with   as an module or as a module value. Renames the earlier parameter module to module as it more   accurately represents the nature of the parameter. The module is   appended to all generated headers through the new HTML renderer   parameter module.

6745,"Shortcode rewrite, take 2","This commit contains a restructuring and partial rewrite of the shortcode handling. Prior to this commit rendering of the page content was mingled with handling of the shortcodes. This led to several oddities. The new flow is:  Shortcodes are extracted from page and replaced with placeholders. Shortcodes are processed and rendered Page is processed The placeholders are replaced with the rendered shortcodes  The handling of summaries is also made simpler by this. This commit also introduces some other chenges:   distinction between shortcodes that need further processing and those who do not:   module: Typically raw HTML. Will not be processed.  module: Will be processed by the page's markup engine (Markdown or (infuture) Asciidoctor)  The above also involves a new shortcode-parser, with lexical scanning inspired by Rob Pike's talk called ""Lexical Scanning in Go"", which should be easier to understand, give better error messages and perform better.  If you want to exclude a shortcode from being processed (for documentation etc.), the inner part of the shorcode must be commented out, i.e. module. See the updated shortcode section in the documentation for further examples.  The new parser supports nested shortcodes. This isn't new, but has two related design choices worth mentioning:  The shortcodes will be rendered individually, so If both module and module are used in the nested hierarchy, one will be passed through the page's markdown processor, the other not. To avoid potential costly overhead of always looking far ahead for a possible closing tag, this implementation looks at the template itself, and is branded as a container with inner content if it contains a reference to module  Fixes #565 Fixes #480 Fixes #461 And probably some others."

6773,First stab at correcting GuessSection tests,"Updated the test to correctly test for """" when a non-absolute path is used. But the tests still fail for multi-part paths e.g. /contents/blog/"
6774,Fix: rewrite FileAndExt,"FileAndExt has now be completely rewritten and now works as may reasonably be expected. The test cases for: ReplaceExtension Filename FileAndExt now all pass. The problem was the way path.Base was being used. Firstly Base returns ""."" if the directory is empty, but it can also return ""."" for the current directory, or "".."" for the parent directory, if these are the last elements in the path. Simply detecting the presence of a ""."" in the returned string and truncating before the ""."" does not therefore always result in a valid filename. Secondly, Base strips any trailing slashes making is more difficult to detect when the path does not end in a filename but in a directory name i.e. a no filename case. Not detecting this incorrectly results in the last directory name being returned as the filename. The code has been updated to take account of of both situations so that: 1) An empty string for both the filename and extension is returned if the path does not contain a filename (plus an optional extension). This includes both the empty path case, and the ends in a directory case. 2) If the path represents a filename with an extension then both the filename and the extension (minus any dots) are returned as non empty strings. 3) If the path represents a filename without an extension then filename will be returned as a non empty string (minus any dot) and the extension will be returned as an empty string."
6775,Fix: remove the unnecessary dot in an extension,Oops minor typo. The new extension passed to ReplaceExtension should not have a dot in it. The test data bas been updated to reflect this.
6776,"Updated TestReplaceExtensioni, TestFilename and TestFileAndExt",Updated the test cases in TestReplaceExtension to reflect the intent of ReplaceExtension which is to accept a path and return only the file name with a new extension. It's intentionally designed to strip out the path and only provide the filename Additional test cases have been added to both TestFilename and TestFileAndExt to clarify behaviour with relative paths.
6777,WriteToDisk and SafeWriteToDisk test cleaned up,Minor cleanup to randomise the names of the temp directories used by the tests.
6778,WriteToDisk and SafeWriteToDisk tests now pass,This is the first time that both the WriteToDisk and SafeWriteToDisk tests pass
6779,Fix: Test TestSafeWriteToDisk now works,"Oops, my bad. Despite the function intending to test SafeWriteToDisk it was actually calling WriteToDisk. WriteToDisk does not return the file exists error that SafeWriteToDisk does, which the test checks for."
6780,Added the path modules test files,"Added the new path modules test file. This replaces the old helpers_test.go file. The currently failing tests are: TestReplaceExtension TestFilename TestFileAndExt TestGuessSection TestFindCWD TestWriteToDisk In addition the TestSafeWriteToDisk test case is currently disabled. It will panic if enabled. In addition there are some minor changes to path.go. They are: Refactored MakePathToLower to simplify it. Commented out, pending removal, Sanitize as it appears to be unused. Fixed the resource leak in UnicodeSanitize Conflicts:     helpers/path.go"
6781,Added the url modules test files.,Added the new url module test file. This replaces the original helpers_test.go file. The TestUrlPrep test currently fails. The only minor change to url.go is to add some trace printf's to UrlPrep.
6782,Added the general modules test files,"Added the new general module's test file, general_test.go. This replaces the helpers_test.go file. There is also a minor defect fix in general.go's StripHTML function. The correct xhtml tag for a break is  not . I've also removed the unnecessary spaces before the replacement ""\n"". The new test module also reflects this change. Conflicts:     helpers/general.go"
6783,Remove the helpers_test.go file,"The helpers_test.go file has been split into three new test files, one each for the path, url and general modules. Conflicts:     helpers/helpers_test.go"
6784,Use page.Markup to determine which PageHandler to use if it's set.,

6794,Adding ReaderTo and ToReader helper functions,
6795,Update menu test to work with revised source struct,
6796,Change the type of .Site.Author from…,"…module to module. This allows values other than module values to be saved to Author, such as: module My specific use-case is that I’m trying to make something work similar whether it’s specified in module or in module without introducing module."
6797,Fix #593 problem with module,

6807,540: add support for build information output to version command,
6808,Fix redirect-loop for Hugo server,"An extra slash was added to the path if baseUrl had a sub-directory, causing infinite redirect loop in Go's HTTP server. Fixes #510"
6809,Add sort and grouping functions for publish date and param of Page,module is modified to allow it to receive a method name argument for example module as its first argument. It is only allowed to call with a method which takes no arguments and returns a result or a pair of a result and an error. The functions discussed at #443 are also added  module: Order contents by module front matter variable module: Group contents by module   front matter variable formatted in string like module module: Group contents by module front matter   variable specified by module argument module: Group contents by module   front matter variable specified by module argument and formatted in   string like module. It's effective against module type   front matter variable
6810,Implement HasMenuCurrent and IsMenuCurrent for Nodes,"Prior to this commit, module and module on module always returned false. This made it hard (if possible at all) to mark the currently selected menu item/group for non-Page content (home page, category pages etc.), i.e. for menus defined in the site configuration. This commit provides an implementation of these two methods. Notable design choices:  These menu items have a loose coupling to the the resources they navigate to; the module is the best common identificator. To facilitate a consistent matching, and to get it in line with the menu items connected to module, relative Urls (Urls starting with '/') for menu items in the site configuration are converted to permaLinks using the same rules used for others’. module only looks at the children of the current node; this is in line with the implementation on module. Due to this loose coupling, module have to search downards in the tree to make sure that the node is inside the current menu. This could have been made simpler if it could answer module to any match of any menu item matching the current resource.  This commit also adds a set of unit tests for the menu system. Fixes #367"

6822,Set Content-Type for livereload.js,The Content-Type was not set for livereload.js and was interpreteted by the browser as text/plain. This commit sets it to application/javascript. Fixes #562
6823,Copy content from archetype,Prior to this commit only metadata were copied from archetype on content creation. This commit includes the content if set in archetype. This is useful in situations with similar page structure. Fixes #556
6824,Make First accept any int,"TOML and YAML handles integers differently, creating issues when using integer values from configuration or front matter in the First template function. This currently works in YAML (parses into int), but not in TOML (parses into int64). This commit modifies First so it accepts any int. Fixes #551"
6825,Fix spf13/hugo#467. RSSLink now point to index.xml,
6826,Add nil-check to Intersect,"The Intersect template-method would fail if one or both of the lists were nil (post vs page; post has tags, page has not). This commit adds a nil-check and returns an empty result if any of the inputs are nil. See #537"
6827,added docs for 'intersect' and 'in' template functions,
6828,Minor proofreading corrections to Hugo docs," Add backticks and commas where necessary Remove some trailing whitespace Add front matter example in TOML Fix typo in one of the tags in Showcase Add 多说 (Duoshuo) as an alternative to Disqus Use internal links (i.e. without gohugo.io) where possible Use a colon to set off an example Change ""it's"" to ""its"" where appropriate Use typographical (i.e. curly) apostrophe on the front page   where appropriate Capitalize ""Github"" as ""GitHub"""

6836,Use md5 against the file path for uniqueness.,
6837,Make each generated page’s footnotes unique.,"If content pages are fully rendered in a list page, footnotes that use the same reference (module) will have duplicated anchors. This change builds on #526 to put the page filename (module) as part of the anchor for a footnote. This would fix discussion link."
6838,Configure footnote rendering.,"  The config file can provide FootnoteAnchorPrefix, which will be used   by blackfriday when rendering to HTML. A value of module has the effect   of making the anchor for a footnote module be module. The   default is module.   The config file can provide FootnoteReturnLinkContents, which will be   used by blackfriday when rendering to HTML. A value of module has the   effect of making the return link be module instead of module. "

6861,"fix tags not being in lowercase, #491",
6862,"added ""eq"" function to docs.",
6863,Enable soft livereload of CSS and images,"Prior to this commit a dummy JavaScript filename was sent to LiveReload when changing a static file (CSS, image etc.), forcing a full browser reload of the page. This commit fixes this by sending the relative file path of the changed static resource, enabling partial live reloading for CSS- and image-changes. If more than one static file happens to end up in the same changeevent-batch, it will fall back to do a full refresh. To enable this logic, the change events with names ending with "".goutputstream*"" is now filtered out as temporary. Changes in dynamic content behaves like before. Issue #490"
6864,"Change all uses of sort.Sort to sort.Stable.Using sort.Stable ensures that even if the sort keys are the same, the order of the sort will not randomly change.  Using the old sort.Sort, if you had pages with no date, the lists of those pages would randomly reorder every time you regenerate the list, causing spurious changes to the output.  Now they'll always get ordered in the same way.",
6865,More error messages at syncing static contents,
6866,fix zero date,
6867,Fix typo in Archetypes documentation.,Archetype was spelled archtype in one of the headers.
6868,Add Node.Site.Pages to all nodes and ensure all pages from the site exist in the list before processing shortcodes.,"Node.Site.Recent is not really just recent pages, but all pages, so I figured it was better to add a new parameter with a more informative name. I also changed the code slightly so that all pages are added to the list of pages before we start rendering shortcodes... this way you can use a shortcode to refer to another page.  Previosuly, this had been broken, because the list ofg pages would not be fully populated while the shortcodes were being processed.  The code that does this is not reading from disk or doing any rendering, so it shouldn't take any more time to do."
6869,"add Name to File, which is the filename minus the extension",
6870,"Go back to lowercase slugs. Also, use MakePathToLower in TestMakeToLower.",go fmt
6871,More proofreading and minor revisions to Hugo docs,"Among the various changes, most instances of module were changed to module Also, in main.go, change ""2013"" to ""2013-14""."
6872,A small fix and update to the multilingual example,"Enclose module with a module test to avoid the ""Content is not a field of struct type *hugolib.Node"" error. Thanks to @spf13 for the tip!  Fixes #366. Also update example to Hugo v0.12 conventions: - Convert config.yaml to config.toml to follow what   module generates - Rename layouts/chrome to layouts/partials - Convert module calls to module calls - Add .gitignore to ignore the module directory - Add README.md with pointers to discussions in issues   to help bring newcomers up to speed with this multilingual example"
6873,"Taxonomies can now be provided as a single string value if there is only one in frontmatter (tag = ""val"" vs tag = [""val""])",

Also remove the line for importing line-icons.css which no longer exists."

6885,quickstart.md: Put long options inside backticks,Also minor adjustment to blank lines.
6886,Adjusting the number of go routines to build the pages in to 4*GOMAXPROCS (from 2) for faster rendering.,
6887,Fix CreatePages,"This fixes #450.  There are two problems: 1.) We're creating a new goroutine for every page. 2.) We're calling s.Pages = append(s.Pages, page) inside each goroutine. 1 is a problem if in that if you have a ton of pages, that's a ton of goroutines.  It's not really useful to have more than a few goroutines at a time, and lots can actually make your code much slower, and, evidently, crash. 2 is a problem in that append is not thread safe. Sometimes it returns a new slice with a larger capacity, when the original slice isn't large enough.  This can cause problems if two goroutines do this at the same time. The solution for 1 is to use a limited number of workers (I chose 2*GOMAXPROCS as a nice guess). The solution for 2 is to serialize access to s.Pages, which I did by doing it in a single goroutine."

6918,"added functionality to check the error message returned from Cobra, if any. for uage message text.

7039,Little syntax mistake,
7040,Fix permalinks to subdomains,"If you don't have access to the root domain of your site (eg a GitHub project page) and you try to generate custom permalinks, they must begin with a slash. Go's URL resolution library sees the leading slash and thinks ""this URL starts at the root"", just like a filesystem - so it discards your subdomain and maps all custom permalinks from the root of your site. Fine if you control the root domain, not so useful if you don't. Removing the check for a leading slash fixes this problem. You can now specify custom permalinks that do not start with a slash, and they will map safely regardless of what subdomain you upload the generated site under. Tests have been updated for this commit so that they continue to function."

These flags/extensions were dropped during the refactor that added the module page variable, and caused features like Markdown tables to no longer work.

Add module to the site config, defining module accessible   to each page; this lets the site maintainer associate arbitrary data   with names, on a site-wide basis. Provide a module function to templates: Use-case: module or anything else which     is a simple iterable provided by hugolib Tests by me for module and module  Also @noahcampbell contributed towards this:  Add UnitTest for module: Digging into this test case a bit more, I'm realizing that we need to create a param test case to ensure that for each type we render (page, index, homepage, rss, etc.) that the proper fields are represented.  This will help us refactor without fear in the future.    Sample config.yaml: module Signed-off-by: Noah Campbell link"

I also cleaned up a bunch of one off functions in site.go."
7285,Fixes #80 - Homepage now renders correctly,I mistakenly make RenderHomePage a NOP.  Bad programmer.
7286,source: Fix failing build on windows,The +build directive was not being picked up.  Apparently needs a space after the +build line.
7287,Fix breaking test cases on unix platform,Rename platform parameter file to agnostic name. Both darwin and linux can share the same paramters.

7289,"Section is determined by the source, not the url",This change allows for top level html content to exists.

7291,Allow non-markdown content in content directory,"Allow content that is not markdown and does not need to be rendered to exists in the content directory.  Currently any valid html or xml document can exist.  Templates are applied to these documents as well. If you need to have content that doesn't have templates or AbsUrlify like operations, then continue to put this content in static and it will be copied over."
7292,More expressive --check output,
7293,Add renderer information to --check,Now reports if the page will be rendered or not and by which render engine.
7294,Add IsRenderable to Page,"As pages are read from the target, they will be assessed if they should be rendered or not.  The logic for IsRenderable is in the parser/page.go and looks for anything exception '<'."

7301,Add /index.html to unadorned alias paths,Bring code to be better in line with documentation.
7302,Remove RenderedContent from page.,The output is written directly to disk after being written.  Not entirely sure why it was split into two steps.
7303,Move alias logic to target module,I want to move all logic to writing aliases to target so I can pave the way for writing aliases specific to other runtimes (like .htaccess for apache or a script for updating AWS or symlinking on a filesystem).
7304,Move alias rendering to target,
7305,Normalize paths within hugo,"filepath was used inconsistently throughout the hugolib.  With the introduction of source and target modules, all path are normalized to ""/"".  This simplifies the processing of paths.  It does mean that contributors need to be aware of using path/filepath in any module other than source or target is not recommended.  The current exception is hugolib/config.go"
7306,Added safeHtml template function,
7307,"Homepage ""/"" respects PublishDir","It wasn't taking the value of PublishDir into consideration for the special case of the homepage ""/"". Fixes #75"
7308,Introduce source.Filesystem,"This provides an abstraction over how files are processed by Hugo.  This allows for alternatives like CMS systems or Dropbox, etc."
7309,Remove page module dependence on opening files,"The site is responsible for reading files, page only operates on buffers."
7310,Expand the ShowPlan functionality,
7311,Move to target.Filesystem,Moving the ugly urls logic to the target.  There is still UglyUrl logic in page for the permlink but this is dealing with the generate of urls.

7313,Add file reporting to planner,
7314,Adding Planner,
7315,"Code reorg, helpers.go has been decomposed.","It started with wanting to move templates in template bundles and the rest followed.  I did my best to start grouping related functions together, but there are some that I missed.  There is also the method Urlize that seems to be a special function used in both worlds.  I'll need to revisit this method."
7316,Date rendering unit tests in pages,"Tests to ensure rendering dates in templates is working correctly. Actually, I was running into invalid templates not giving warnings when I was trying to render a date."
7317,Remove hugolib.HTML and hugolib.URL types,These types were not be rendered correctly by the html/template package. Removing them gets the correct behavior. Fixes #74
7318,Include building hugo docs as part of test.,"If the building of the doc fails, tarvis will fail.  This will help with pull requests."
7319,Include building hugo docs as part of test.,"If the building of the doc fails, tarvis will fail.  This will help with pull requests."

7322,Use s everywhere for consistency,Signed-off-by: Noah Campbell link
7323,Return an error (other than 0) when ./hugo fails,Being a good OS citizen so folks can compose hugo into their tool chain. Also helps with git bisect run.
7324,The more (summary divider) now works even if it is on the same line as content,Signed-off-by: Noah Campbell link
7325,Small code cleanup,
7326,Return an error with WritePublic,
7327,Removing site.Directories.,Please revert if this is used somewhere.
7328,Externalize the writing of content to a target,"Introducing the target module in hugo.  This provides the simple interface for writing content given a label (filename) and a io.Reader containing the content to be written. If site.Target is not set, it defaults back to the original behavior of writing to file system. In hugolib/site_url_test.go I have an InMemoryTarget for testing purposes and use it to see if the final output of a render matches."
7329,Ensure Section is set before returning Page object.,
7330,"Revert ""Return errors when rendering""",This reverts commit e66ba5d2a7dd1a043a24bf86a271a5440b7b1385. Fixed #69

Using a module html comment in your markdown / rst you can indiciate where the summary should end and have the summary converted to html.

7339,Add 404.html for gh-pages,Signed-off-by: Noah Campbell link
7340,RenderThing test cases,"Provide unit test support RenderThing. One observation is that creating the site.Tmpl variable is a one time event.  site.Tmpl doesn't like additional templates with the same name. This means that updating a template while in --watch mode requires throwing away the entire Site object and creating a new one.  Not that this is a bad idea, but it is something I discovered while working on these unit tests."
7341,Test cases for ignoreDotFile,"Meant to commit this earlier, but it's a basic unit test."
7342,Update .gitignore to ignore *.swo files,For the fellow vim user.
7343,Fix benchmark so the buffer is read each time.,The bytes.Buffer was exhausted after the first read.  Creating a new reader each invocation catpures the correctly timing.
7344,Removing GetSection,Using GetXXX is not idiomatic to Go.  Also added a bunch of unit testing around this method.
7345,"Skip ""dot"" files in layout","As a vim user, .filename.swp files pop up.  This change prevents hugo from reading those files."

7371,Enable aliases from .xhtml paths,"When redirecting an alias from a .xhtml path, served with default content type, a redirect only works if the html element has a xmlns attribute.  This adds the attribute when the alias path ends in .xhtml"
7372,Skip Static directory if its in your content directory,"Allows organisation where all source files are in one directory: moduleconfig.yaml`: contentdir: ""source"" staticdir: ""source/static"" ... .     └── source         ├── post         |   ├── firstpost.md    // <- http://site.com/post/firstpost.html         |   └── secondpost.md   // <- http://site.com/post/secondpost.html         └── static             └── css                  └── site.css   // <- http://site.com/css/site.css ```"

7394,Support for non-standard formats.,Forgot to include existing formats.  Integration tests include new format.
7395,Move timezone tests to integration test.,"Interacting with timezones will result in checks against the filesystem. This access, by definition, is an integration test.  Creating a *integration_test.go file will signify this change. When interacting with Travis-ci.org, the ubuntu boxes plus go 1.1 do not seem to support shortcode timezones, think PST.  In this case, the tests are skipped.  This is not ideal, but the IRC #go-nuts channel has indicated timezone support is still lacking.  We should advise users of hugo that timezone support may be an issue and report any odd behavior. The workaround is to use numeric timezones (-08:00 for PST, etc.)"
7396,Add additional details to date test cases.,
7397,Provide better support for various date formats.,Fixes #30 as long as the date is well formatted.

7409,Adding more test cases,
7410,Adding benchmark for parsing pages using unicode.,The resulting comparsion is not equal because NewPage reads the file each time where ReadFrom just reads a buffer in memory.

7412,Introduce unit testing for page.go,
7413,Remove unreachable code path.,

7433,Fix example in docs that wouldn't work in practice,"The pflag package used in hugo has to use the ""="" sign for double dash options such as --source. Thus the original example module is already incorrect. Adding the = sign though woul not fix things in this case, since module does not get resolved to /home/username/mysite, but looks for the ./~/mysite directory within the current directory. To resolve this, either the directory name has to be changed in the docs not to use the ""~"" sign, or have to change to use the single dash version of the command line flag. The latter seems to be more in line with the rest of the example. Leaving module as a double dash option to minimize the change, though it could be either way, since the follow up example uses the single dash version of both."
