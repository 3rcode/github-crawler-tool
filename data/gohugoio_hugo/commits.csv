It's also possible to use type fragments indices in shortcode, e.g.: {{ $related := site.RegularPages.Related .Page }} But, and this is important, you need to include the shortcode using the {{< delimiter.

No error will be returned when parsing Inf, Infinity or NaN (case insensitive) because they will be coverted to special floating point values and therefore are legal float values. Now we check if the returned converted values are special floating values and treat them as string literals. Fixes #10389"

183,tocss: Add vars option,"This commit adds a new vars option to both the Sass transpilers (Dart Sass and Libsass). This means that you can pass a map with key/value pairs to the transpiler: handlebars {{ $vars := dict ""$color1"" ""blue"" ""$color2"" ""green"" ""$font_size"" ""24px"" }} {{ $cssOpts := (dict ""transpiler"" ""dartsass"" ""outputStyle"" ""compressed"" ""vars"" $vars ) }} {{ $r := resources.Get ""scss/main.scss"" |  toCSS $cssOpts }} And the the variables will be available in the hugo:vars namespace. Example usage for Dart Sass: ```scss @use ""hugo:vars"" as v; p {     color: v.$color1;     font-size: v.$font_size; } ``` Note that Libsass does not support the use keyword, so you need to import them as global variables: ```scss @import ""hugo:vars""; p {     color: $color1;     font-size: $font_size; } ``` Hugo will:  Add a missing leading $ for the variable names if needed. Wrap the values in unquote('VALUE') (Sass built-in) to get proper handling of identifiers vs other strings.  This means that you can pull variables directly from e.g. the site config: toml [params] [params.sassvars] color1 = ""blue"" color2 = ""green"" font_size = ""24px"" image = ""images/hero.jpg"" handlebars {{ $vars := site.Params.sassvars}} {{ $cssOpts := (dict ""transpiler"" ""dartsass"" ""outputStyle"" ""compressed"" ""vars"" $vars ) }} {{ $r := resources.Get ""scss/main.scss"" |  toCSS $cssOpts }} Fixes #10555",tocss: Add vars option,"This commit adds a new vars option to both the Sass transpilers (Dart Sass and Libsass).

342,Fix shortcode parser regression with quoted param values,"This issue was introduced in v0.102.0. In 223bf2800488ad5d38854bbb595d789bc35ebe32 we removed the byte source from the parsed page result, which meant we had to preserve exact positioning for all elements. This introduced some new TypeIgnore tokens which we, wrongly, assumed didn't matter where we put in the result slice (they should be ignored anyway). But it seems that this broke the logic where we determine if it's positional or named params in the case where the paramater value contains escaped quoutes. This commit makes sure that these ignore tokens (the back slashes) are never sent back to the client, which is how it was before v0.102.0. This commit also fixes some lost error information in that same commit. Fixes #10236",Fix shortcode parser regression with quoted param values,"This issue was introduced in v0.102.0.

620,Fail with error when double-rendering text in markdownify/RenderString,"This commit prevents the most commons case of infinite recursion in link render hooks when the linkify option is enabled (see below). This is always a user error, but getting a stack overflow (the current stack limit in Go is 1 GB on 64-bit, 250 MB on 32-bit) error isn't very helpful. This fix will not prevent all such errors, though, but we may do better once #9570 is in place.

777,Fix missing page data for alternative formats,"When a template calls the .Translations function and a Hugo environment is using multiple output formats, a template that calls methods like .Summary and .Len on each translation will unexpectedly show empty return values for these methods. This is because each pageOutput's ContentProvider is assigned to a page.NopPage in newPageOutput. When HugoSites.render assigns pageContentOutputs to pageOutputs in pageState.shiftToOutputFormat, it reuses pageContentOutputs from other pageOutputs, leaving some pageContentOutputs as NopPages. While this approach conserves resources, sometimes it means that a template will unexpectedly call a method on a pageContentOutput that is actually a NopPage. In the case of ContentProvider methods called on translations for alternative output formats, the methods were called on NopPages. This change introduces LazyContentProvider, which performs late initialization when one of its methods is called. This way, we can reuse content in ""normal"" cases but ensure that ContentProvider methods work as expected when a pageOutput is not assigned a pageContentOutput during the initial pre-render phase. Fixes #8919",Fix missing page data for alternative formats,"When a template calls the .Translations function and a Hugo environment is using multiple output formats, a template that calls methods like .Summary and .Len on each translation will unexpectedly show empty return values for these methods. This is because each pageOutput's ContentProvider is assigned to a page.NopPage in newPageOutput. When HugoSites.render assigns pageContentOutputs to pageOutputs in pageState.shiftToOutputFormat, it reuses pageContentOutputs from other pageOutputs, leaving some pageContentOutputs as NopPages. While this approach conserves resources, sometimes it means that a template will unexpectedly call a method on a pageContentOutput that is actually a NopPage.

794,Fix surprise OutputFormat.Rel overwriting,"In page.NewOutputFormat, we take an output.Format f and use it to create a page.OutputFormat. If the format is canonical, we assign the final OutputFormat's Rel to ""canonical"" rather than using f.Rel. However, this leads to unexpected behavior for custom output formats, where a user can define a ""rel"" for a format via the config file. For example, the standard for ""humans.txt"" files requires using rel=""author"" in HTML ""link"" elements. Meanwhile, humans.txt is usually the only format used for its content. As a result, for Hugo configurations that define a humans.txt custom output format, Hugo will render ""link"" elements to content in this format with rel=""canonical,"" rather than ""author"" as required by the standard. This commit changes page.NewOutputFormat to check whether a given format is user defined and, if so, skips assigning Rel to ""canonical,"" even if isCanonical is true.

957,Pass minification errors to the user,"Previously, *minifyTransformation.Transform suppressed the error returned by t.m.Minify. This meant that when minification returned an error, the error would not reach the user. Instead, minification would silently fail. For example, if a JavaScript file included a call to the Date constructor with: new Date(2020, 04, 02) The package that the minification library uses to parse JS files, github.com/tdewolff/parse would return an error, since ""04"" would be parsed as a legacy octal. However, the JS file would remain un-minified with no error. Fixing this is not as simple as replacing ""_"" with an ""err"" in *minifyTransformation.Transform, however (though this is necessary). If we only returned this error from Transform, then hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled would fail. Instead of being a no-op, as TestResourceMinifyDisabled expects, using the ""minify"" template function with a ""disableXML=true"" config setting instead returns the error, ""minifier does not exist for mimetype."" The ""minifier does not exist"" error is returned because of the way minifiers.New works. If the user's config disables minification for a particular MIME type, minifiers.New does not add it to the resulting Client's minify.M. However, this also means that when the ""minify"" template function is executed,  a resourceAdapter's transformations still add a minification. When it comes time to call the minify.Minifier for a specific MIME type via *M.MinifyMimetype, the github.com/tdewolff/minify library throws the ""does not exist"" error for the missing MIME type. The solution was to change minifiers.New so, instead of skipping a minifier for each disabled MIME type, it adds  a NoOpMinifier, which simply copies the source to the destination without minification. This means that when the ""minify"" template function is used for a particular resource, and that resource's MIME type has minification disabled, minification is genuinely skipped, and does not result in an error. In order to add this, I've fixed a possibly unwanted interaction between minifiers.TestConfigureMinify and hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled. The latter disables minification and expects minification to be a no-op. The former disables minification and expects it to result in an error. The only reason hugolib.TestResourceMinifyDisabled passes in the original code is that the ""does not exist"" error is suppressed. However, we shouldn't suppress minification errors, since they can leave users perplexed. I've changed the test assertion in minifiers.TestConfigureMinify to expect no errors and a no-op if minification is disabled for a particular MIME type.

This commit improves that situation given the following rules:  A single integer argument is used as plural count and passed to the i18n template as a int type with a .Count method. The latter is to preserve compability with v1. Else the plural count is either fetched from the Count/count field/method/map or from the value itself. Any data type is accepted, if it can be converted to an integer, that value is used.  The above means that you can now do pass a single integer and both of the below will work: {{ . }} minutes to read {{ .Count }} minutes to read Fixes #8454 Closes #7822 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1410",langs/i18n: Revise the plural implementation,"There were some issues introduced with the plural counting when we upgraded from v1 to v2 of go-i18n.

1830,Collect HTML elements during the build to use in PurgeCSS etc.,"The main use case for this is to use with resources.PostProcess and resources.PostCSS with purgecss. You would normally set it up to extract keywords from your templates, doing it from the full /public takes forever for bigger sites. Doing the template thing misses dynamically created class names etc., and it's hard/impossible to set up in when using themes. You can enable this in your site config: toml [build]   writeStats = true It will then write a hugo_stats.json file to the project root as part of the build. If you're only using this for the production build, you should consider putting it below config/production. You can then set it up with PostCSS like this: ```js const purgecss = require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')({     content: [ './hugo_stats.json' ],     defaultExtractor: (content) => {         let els = JSON.parse(content).htmlElements;         return els.tags.concat(els.classes, els.ids);     } }); module.exports = {     plugins: [         require('tailwindcss'),         require('autoprefixer'),         ...(process.env.HUGO_ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ?

1971,Introduce a tree map for all content,"This commit introduces a new data structure to store pages and their resources. This data structure is backed by radix trees.

2036,tpl/tplimpl: Rework template management to get rid of concurrency issues,"This more or less completes the simplification of the template handling code in Hugo started in v0.62. The main motivation was to fix a long lasting issue about a crash in HTML content files  without front matter. But this commit also comes with a big functional improvement. As we now have moved the base template evaluation to the build stage we now use the same lookup rules for baseof as for list etc. type of templates. This means that in this simple example you can have a baseof template for the blog section without having to duplicate the others: layouts ├── _default │   ├── baseof.html │   ├── list.html │   └── single.html └── blog     └── baseof.html Also, when simplifying code, you often get rid of some double work, as shown in the ""site building"" benchmarks below. These benchmarks looks suspiciously good, but I have repeated the below with ca. the same result.

2409,Add Hugo Modules,"This commit implements Hugo Modules. This is a broad subject, but some keywords include:  A new module configuration section where you can import almost anything. You can configure both your own file mounts nd the file mounts of the modules you import. This is the new recommended way of configuring what you earlier put in configDir, staticDir etc. And it also allows you to mount folders in non-Hugo-projects, e.g. the SCSS folder in the Bootstrap GitHub project. A module consists of a set of mounts to the standard 7 component types in Hugo: static, content, layouts, data, assets, i18n, and archetypes. Yes, Theme Components can now include content, which should be very useful, especially in bigger multilingual projects. Modules not in your local file cache will be downloaded automatically and even ""hot replaced"" while the server is running. Hugo Modules supports and encourages semver versioned modules, and uses the minimal version selection algorithm to resolve versions. A new set of CLI commands are provided to manage all of this: hugo mod init,  hugo mod get,  hugo mod graph,  hugo mod tidy, and  hugo mod vendor.  All of the above is backed by Go Modules.

2690,Add /config dir support,"This commit adds support for a configuration directory (default config). The different pieces in this puzzle are:  A new --environment (or -e) flag. This can also be set with the HUGO_ENVIRONMENT OS environment variable. The value for environment defaults to production when running hugo and development when running hugo server. You can set it to any value you want (e.g. hugo server -e ""Sensible Environment""), but as it is used to load configuration from the file system, the letter case may be important. You can get this value in your templates with {{ hugo.Environment }}. A new --configDir flag (defaults to config below your project). This can also be set with HUGO_CONFIGDIR OS environment variable.  If the configDir exists, the configuration files will be read and merged on top of each other from left to right; the right-most value will win on duplicates. Given the example tree below: If environment is production, the left-most config.toml would be the one directly below the project (this can now be omitted if you want), and then _default/config.toml and finally production/config.toml. And since these will be merged, you can just provide the environment specific configuration setting in you production config, e.g. enableGitInfo = true.

3028,Fix Resource output in multihost setups,"In Hugo 0.46 we made the output of what you get from resources.Get and similar static, i.e. language agnostic. This makes total sense, as it is wasteful and time-consuming to do SASS/SCSS/PostCSS processing for lots of languages when the output is lots of duplicates with different filenames. But since we now output the result once only, this had a negative side effect for multihost setups: We publish the resource once only to the root folder (i.e. not to the language ""domain folder""). This commit removes the language code from the processed image keys. This creates less duplication in the file cache, but it means that you should do a hugo --gc to clean up stale files.

3107,Simplify .Site.GetPage etc.,"This commit is a follow up to a recent overhaul of the GetPage/ref/relref implemenation. The most important change in this commit is the update to .Site.GetPage:   To reduce the amount of breakage in the wild to its minimum, I have reworked .Site.GetPage with some rules:   We cannot support more than 2 arguments, i.e. .Site.GetPage ""page"" ""posts"" ""mypage.md"" will now throw an error. I think this is the most uncommon syntax and should be OK. It is an easy fix to change the above to .Site.GetPage ""/posts/mypage.md"" or similar.  .Site.GetPage ""home"", .Site.GetPage ""home"" """" and .Site.GetPage ""home"" ""/"" will give you the home page. This means that if you have page in root with the name home.md you need to do .Site.GetPage ""/home.md"" or similar  This commit also fixes some multilingual issues, most notable it is now possible to do cross-language ref/relref lookups by prepending the language code to the path, e.g. /jp/posts/mypage.md. This commit also reverts the site building tests related to this to ""Hugo 0.44 state"", to get better control of the changes made.

To compile this from source, you will also need a C compiler installed: HUGO_BUILD_TAGS=extended mage install Note that you can use output of the SCSS processing later in a non-SCSSS-enabled Hugo. The SCSS processor is a Resource transformation step and it can be chained with the many others in a pipeline: bash {{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | resources.ToCSS | resources.PostCSS | resources.Minify | resources.Fingerprint }} <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}"" integrity=""{{ $styles.Data.Digest }}"" media=""screen""> The transformation funcs above have aliases, so it can be shortened to: bash {{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }} <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}"" integrity=""{{ $styles.Data.Digest }}"" media=""screen""> A quick tip would be to avoid the fingerprinting part, and possibly also the not-superfast postCSS when you're doing development, as it allows Hugo to be smarter about the rebuilding.

3204,Add support for theme composition and inheritance,"This commit adds support for theme composition and inheritance in Hugo. With this, it helps thinking about a theme as a set of ordered components: toml theme = [""my-shortcodes"", ""base-theme"", ""hyde""] The theme definition example above in config.toml creates a theme with the 3 components with presedence from left to right. So, Hugo will, for any given file, data entry etc., look first in the project, and then in my-shortcode, base-theme and lastly hyde. Hugo uses two different algorithms to merge the filesystems, depending on the file type:  For i18n and data files, Hugo merges deeply using the translation id and data key inside the files. For static, layouts (templates) and archetypes files, these are merged on file level. So the left-most file will be chosen.  The name used in the theme definition above must match a folder in /your-site/themes, e.g. /your-site/themes/my-shortcodes. There are  plans to improve on this and get a URL scheme so this can be resolved automatically. Also note that a component that is part of a theme can have its own configuration file, e.g. config.toml. There are currently some restrictions to what a theme component can configure:  params (global and per language) menu (global and per language) outputformats and mediatypes  The same rules apply here: The left-most param/menu etc. with the same ID will win. There are some hidden and experimental namespace support in the above, which we will work to improve in the future, but theme authors are encouraged to create their own namespaces to avoid naming conflicts. A final note: Themes/components can also have a theme definition in their config.toml and similar, which is the ""inheritance"" part of this commit's title. This is currently not supported by the Hugo theme site. We will have to wait for some ""auto dependency"" feature to be implemented for that to happen, but this can be a powerful feature if you want to create your own theme-variant based on others.

3791,Only re-render the view(s) you're working on,"Hugo already, in its server mode,  support partial rebuilds. To put it simply: If you change about.md, only that content page is read and processed, then Hugo does some processing (taxonomies etc.) and the full site is rendered. This commit covers the rendering part: We now only re-render the pages you work on, i.e. the last n pages you watched in the browser (which obviously also includes the  page in the example above). To be more specific: When you are running the hugo server in watch (aka. livereload) mode, and change a template or a content file, then we do a partial re-rendering of the following:  The current content page (if it is a content change) The home page Up to the last 10 pages you visited on the site.  This should in most cases be enough, but if you navigate to something completely different, you may see stale content. Doing an edit will then refresh that page. Note that this feature is enabled by default. To turn it off, run hugo server --disableFastRender.

4820,Fix case issues with Params,"There are currently several Params and case related issues floating around in Hugo. This is very confusing for users and one of the most common support questions on the forum. And while there have been done some great leg work in Viper etc., this is of limited value since this and similar doesn't work: Params.myCamelCasedParam Hugo has control over all the template method invocations, and can take care of all the lower-casing of the map lookup keys. But that doesn't help with direct template lookups of type Site.Params.TWITTER_CONFIG.USER_ID. This commit solves that by doing some carefully crafted modifications of the templates' AST -- lowercasing the params keys. This is low-level work, but it's not like the template API wil change -- and this is important enough to defend such ""bit fiddling"". Tests are added for all the template engines: Go templates, Ace and Amber.

This seems to be because Hugo tries to take the meminterval from the command line (an Int) and converts it to a String and passes it to time.ParseDuration. If you pass a different meminterval (such as 1000 as above) it will fail (time.ParseDuration requires some units) and use the default instead. Changed meminterval to be a String and added better documentation for valid time units.

Hugo's way of adding a dozen of global variables for the different filesystems was a mistake. In readFile (and also in some other places in Hugo today) we need a way to restrict the access inside the working dir. We could use ioutil.ReadFile and implement the path checking, checking the base path and the dots ("".."") etc. But it is obviously better to use an Afero BasePathFs combined witha ReadOnlyFs. We could create a use-once-filesystem and handle the initialization ourselves, but since this is also useful to others and the initialization depends on some other global state (which would mean to create a new file system on every invocation), we might as well do it properly and encapsulate the predefined set of filesystems. This change also leads the way, if needed, to encapsulate the file systems in a struct, making it possible to have several file system sets in action at once (parallel multilanguage site building?

6482,Expansion of unit tests for utils/utils.go,"This commit expands the test coverage for the utils/utils.go module. The utils module uses the 'github.com/spf13/jwalterweatherman' (aka jww) package for logging. The tests take the approach of examining the log file that is produced by this module to verify correct behaviour. This avoids refactoring the utils module. The log file messages written by the jww module are of the form: : yyyy/mm/dd  The checkLogFile function checks each of these parts in turn except for the date string, which is currently ignored. The final part of the log file format can either be a single error message, or a series of strings followed by an error message. Both the error message and the series of strings can be empty strings. The log file is checked using a combination of the regex package, along with the bufio scanner type. Each test logs to its own temporary log file. This is achieved with standard test setup and teardown functions. One consequence of these tests is that StopOnErr has been refactored into call a new unexported function doStopOnErr which contains the bulk of the original logic. This allows the same testing approach to be used with StopOnErr as with CheckErr and cutUsageMessage, rather than look at the exit status code of the test itself. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the author of the tests must now know if a log file is expected or not. If doStopOnErr determines that an empty error message would be written to the log file then nothing is written. In the context of the tests this means that the log file created by the test would have no contents. Consequently there would be nothing for the test to examine. This situation is indicated by the boolean flag logFileExoected in the testData struct, and processed by the logFileIsExpectedAndValid function.

6721,Provide (relative) reference funcs & shortcodes.,"  .Ref and .RelRef take a reference (the logical filename for a     page, including extension and/or a document fragment ID) and return     a permalink (or relative permalink) to the referenced document.  If the reference is a page name (such as about.md), the page     will be discovered and the permalink will be returned: /about/ If the reference is a page name with a fragment (such as     about.md#who), the page will be discovered and used to add the     page.UniqueID() to the resulting fragment and permalink:     /about/#who:deadbeef. If the reference is a fragment and .*Ref has been called from     a Node or SiteInfo, it will be returned as is: #who. If the reference is a fragment and .*Ref has been called from     a Page, it will be returned with the page’s unique ID:     #who:deadbeef.    .*Ref can be called from either Node, SiteInfo (e.g.,     Node.Site), Page objects, or ShortcodeWithPage objects in     templates.   .*Ref cannot be used in content, so two shortcodes have been     created to provide the functionality to content: ref and relref.     These are intended to be used within markup, like [Who]({{% ref     about.md#who %}}) or <a href=""{{% ref about.md#who %}}"">Who</a>.   There are also ref and relref template functions (used to create     the shortcodes) that expect a Page or Node object and the     reference string (e.g., {{ relref . ""about.md"" }} or {{     ""about.md"" | ref . }}). It actually looks for .*Ref as defined on     Node or Page objects.

6769,"Shortcode rewrite, take 2","This commit contains a restructuring and partial rewrite of the shortcode handling. Prior to this commit rendering of the page content was mingled with handling of the shortcodes. This led to several oddities. The new flow is:  Shortcodes are extracted from page and replaced with placeholders. Shortcodes are processed and rendered Page is processed The placeholders are replaced with the rendered shortcodes  The handling of summaries is also made simpler by this. This commit also introduces some other chenges:   distinction between shortcodes that need further processing and those who do not:   {{< >}}: Typically raw HTML. Will not be processed.  {{% %}}: Will be processed by the page's markup engine (Markdown or (infuture) Asciidoctor)  The above also involves a new shortcode-parser, with lexical scanning inspired by Rob Pike's talk called ""Lexical Scanning in Go"", which should be easier to understand, give better error messages and perform better.  If you want to exclude a shortcode from being processed (for documentation etc.), the inner part of the shorcode must be commented out, i.e. {{%/* movie 47238zzb */%}}. See the updated shortcode section in the documentation for further examples.  The new parser supports nested shortcodes. This isn't new, but has two related design choices worth mentioning:  The shortcodes will be rendered individually, so If both {{< >}} and {{% %}} are used in the nested hierarchy, one will be passed through the page's markdown processor, the other not. To avoid potential costly overhead of always looking far ahead for a possible closing tag, this implementation looks at the template itself, and is branded as a container with inner content if it contains a reference to .Inner  Fixes #565 Fixes #480 Fixes #461 And probably some others.","Shortcode rewrite, take 2","This commit contains a restructuring and partial rewrite of the shortcode handling.

This isn't new, but has two related design choices worth mentioning: The shortcodes will be rendered individually, so If both {{< >}} and {{% %}} are used in the nested hierarchy, one will be passed through the page's markdown processor, the other not. To avoid potential costly overhead of always looking far ahead for a possible closing tag, this implementation looks at the template itself, and is branded as a container with inner content if it contains a reference to .Inner Fixes #565 Fixes #480 Fixes #461 And probably some others."

6798,Fix: rewrite FileAndExt,"FileAndExt has now be completely rewritten and now works as may reasonably be expected. The test cases for: ReplaceExtension Filename FileAndExt now all pass. The problem was the way path.Base was being used. Firstly Base returns ""."" if the directory is empty, but it can also return ""."" for the current directory, or "".."" for the parent directory, if these are the last elements in the path. Simply detecting the presence of a ""."" in the returned string and truncating before the ""."" does not therefore always result in a valid filename. Secondly, Base strips any trailing slashes making is more difficult to detect when the path does not end in a filename but in a directory name i.e. a no filename case. Not detecting this incorrectly results in the last directory name being returned as the filename. The code has been updated to take account of of both situations so that: 1) An empty string for both the filename and extension is returned if the path does not contain a filename (plus an optional extension). This includes both the empty path case, and the ends in a directory case. 2) If the path represents a filename with an extension then both the filename and the extension (minus any dots) are returned as non empty strings. 3) If the path represents a filename without an extension then filename will be returned as a non empty string (minus any dot) and the extension will be returned as an empty string.",Fix: rewrite FileAndExt,"FileAndExt has now be completely rewritten and now works as may reasonably be expected.

This commit provides an implementation of these two methods. Notable design choices:  These menu items have a loose coupling to the the resources they navigate to; the Url is the best common identificator. To facilitate a consistent matching, and to get it in line with the menu items connected to Page, relative Urls (Urls starting with '/') for menu items in the site configuration are converted to permaLinks using the same rules used for others’. IsMenuCurrent only looks at the children of the current node; this is in line with the implementation on Page. Due to this loose coupling, IsMenuCurrent have to search downards in the tree to make sure that the node is inside the current menu. This could have been made simpler if it could answer yes to any match of any menu item matching the current resource.  This commit also adds a set of unit tests for the menu system.
