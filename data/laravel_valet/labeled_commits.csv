Merge pull request #1411 from drbyte/install-via-alt-tap,0.29947144,Just a note that 2.13.14 was supposed to be 2.13.4 but I have fat fingers.,Install older PHP versions via alternate tap,0
Install older PHP versions via alternate tap,0.6983384,Install older PHP versions via alternate tap by @drbyte in https://github.com/laravel/valet/pull/1411,"Fixes #1407 Homebrew's support policy now aggressively disables older versions earlier than it did previously. That is why we tap the shivammathur/php repository. But since Homebrew also now ""keeps"" those old formulae but marks them as disabled, when Valet runs brew install php@7.4 it fails because Homebrew just aborts due to its flags in the outdated formula. (They mark it as ""disabled"" and/or ""keg_only :versioned_formula"", but don't actually delete the formula from their repository.) To override that we must use brew install shivammathur/php/php@7.4 internally. Therefore, we need to maintain a list of which PHP Versions we wish to specifically prefix with the shivammathur/php tap in order to bypass Homebrew's flags. ANNUAL MAINTENANCE 1. This PR adds the array of LIMITED_PHP_VERSIONS which we will have to update annually when new PHP versions are retired as others are released. 2. We should also annually update the LATEST_PHP_VERSION string.",0

Force removal of orphaned valet.sock file,0.73467636,Delete rogue valet.sock files when changing PHP versions (#1028),"When switching PHP versions the valet.sock file may not be removed if the linked PHP process doesn't get shut down properly. This can happen when Homebrew switches default php version aliases and if one has started multiple homebrew PHP instances under different permission levels or different users. This patch merely forces the .sock file's removal when switching versions.  In very rare cases a filesystem lock may prevent the file's proper removal, in which case a reboot might be required. To prevent these issues, keep Homebrew up-to-date by running brew upgrade on a regular basis (weekly is good).",1

Test the new Proxies features,0.62711287,Add the ability to proxy insecurely (#1005),"Updated the proxies method to return the URL + .tld as the rendered output wasn't exactly what one would expect. While not critical, it was not consistent. Refactored some of the Site class to aid in testing using a fake instead of relying on a ton of mocking. The Site fake has support for both using tests/output as well as named fixtures (tests/fixtures/Proxies). Testing for certificate I/O is pretty whack, but this is the best I could come up with that would still ensure the certificate stuff was getting called without actually requiring sudo to run phpunit. Replaced instances referring directly to VALET_HOME_PATH with calls to the new valetHomePath(). This method is taken over in the fake Site implementation so that everything runs the same using the fake Site without having to change other assumptions. Updated several ""path"" methods (and many of their usages) to take the ""thing"" you are looking for so you can either get the path to the type of ""thing"" you are looking for or the direct path to the specific ""thing"" you are looking for. Examples: ``` // ~/.config/valet/Nginx $site->nginxPath(); // ~/.config/valet/Nginx/some-site.com.test $site->nginxPath('some-site.com.test'); ``` Made some other tests related to the existence of Sites directory that resulted in updating the mocks for many of the other tests. All in all, it should make other aspects of the Site class handle things more gracefully if Sites doesn't exist.",0

The problem with installing an older version is that Homebrew no longer symlinks it automatically.
