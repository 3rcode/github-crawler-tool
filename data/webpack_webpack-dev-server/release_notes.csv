dev server client compatibility with IE11/IE10/IE9 (#3129) (1e3e656)


For IE11/IE10 you need polyfill fetch() and Promise, example:


js
  module.exports = {

        'core-js/features/promise', 
        './entry.js'
      ],
    },
  };

For IE9 you need polyfill fetch() and Promise and use sockjs for communications (because WebSocket is not supported), example:

js
  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      entry: [
        'whatwg-fetch', 
        'core-js/features/promise',
