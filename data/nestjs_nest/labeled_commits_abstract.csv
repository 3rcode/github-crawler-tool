"perf(common): In case of an expensive log, allow to pass a function",0.86905545,"11281 perf(common): In case of an expensive log, allow to pass a function (@hansl)","In certain case, it is very expensive to log some values. Instead of checking if certain level is enabled, allow the users to pass in a function that is only called if we need to stringify the log value. This keeps the API small, while still allowing expensive logging to be called when needed, and skipped when not. e.g. instead of javascript // This check is technically done twice. if (this.logger.isLevelEnabled('debug')) {   this.logger.debug(this.generateAsciiArtFromJpeg()); } the customer could use: javascript this.logger.debug(() => this.generateAsciiArtFromJpeg());",1

fix(common): correct order for logger error parameters,0.90591407,10531 fix(common): correct order for logger error parameters (@ChrisiPK),"The error() function of a logger has two optional parameters: the trace and the context. The logger now no longer passes the global context as the first optional parameter when there are is no value supplied for the trace parameter. Instead, the trace parameter is passed as undefined and the context is passed as the second optional parameter. This fixes a bug where the trace is overwritten by the context when passed to custom loggers. Fixes gremo/nest-winston#473",1

fix: use pipeline over stream.pipe,0.81944245,9819 fix: use pipeline over stream.pipe (@jmcdo29),"pipeline ends up destroying streams used if there is an error in one of the streams. Due to this, there's no chance of a memory leak from errored out streams. There's also now an addition of adding an error handler to the StreamableFile so that stream errors by default return a 400 and can be customized to return an error message however a developer would like. These only effect the express adapter because of how Fastify already internally handles streams. fix: #9759",1

fix(microservices): generate service method in lower and uppercase,0.904882,9052 fix(microservices): generate service method in lower and uppercase (@TomChv),"RPC methods in protobuf are commonly declare in PascalCase, but they were generated lowercase by ClientGrpcProxy.getService method. Protobuf and gRPC have tools to generate interface and message in Typescript directly from protobuf. It's a powerful feature that's helping to maintain only one source of truth. But with that lowercase method generation, developers were forced to define their own interface which can be painful to maintain. This commit fix that issue by generating methods both in lowercase and in uppercase. Solves #9047 Signed-off-by: Vasek - Tom C tom.chauveau@epitech.eu",1

fix(core): convert URIError thrown by the HTTP platform to BadRequestException,0.8823382,8916 fix(core): convert URIError thrown by the HTTP platform to BadRequestException (@StevenGBrown),"When given a path parameter with an invalid percent encoding, Express throws a URIError with the statusCode field set to 400 (bad request): link Convert this URIError to a BadRequestException before providing it to the exception filters. Therefore the exception filters will handle this error in the same way as other bad requests. Note that this only applies to errors thrown directly from Express or Fastify. A URIError thrown from a NestJS construct such as a controller or validation pipe will continue to be provided to the exception filters as is. Closes #8915",1

With this new useMocker fluent function it becomes possible to tell the TestingInjector to replace the undefined dependency with the automocking function. In doing so classes that have a large number of dependencies no longer must be mocked one-by-one . This is especially great when it comes to packages like @golevelup/ts-jest which can create mocked dependencies of interfaces and classes with a single function. I'm sure I've probably missed an edge case in here, so please let me know if you have any major concerns.",0

"fix(packaging): limit global types to ""node""",0.5518277,9780 chore(deps-dev): bump @types/node from 17.0.42 to 17.0.43 (@dependabot[bot]),"The @types/vinyl-fs package (pulled in by @types/gulp for the build process) includes a re-typing of the NodeJS.WritableStream interface in the global namespace, which is causing the package build process to include a triple-slash directive referencing the vinyl-fs types in @nestjs/core/router/sse-stream.d.ts. As @types/vinyl-fs is not included in the depenedencies of @nestjs/core (nor should it be, as it is only a build-time depenedency) this can cause the typescript compilation in a consuming package to fail in some conditions. A grep of a clean build of all the @nestjs packages shows that this is the only non-node @types package referenced in a triple-slash directive, so we should be able to safely limit the global types used in all packages to just ""node"", as changed here. (Arguably this could mean that @types/node should be included as a peerDependency of @nestjs/core, but I think it's safer to assume that anyone using nest will have that installed.) Fixes #7247",0
