3,Lazily initalise the HttpClient for the Bitbucket OAuth2ClientRegistry (#1239),Lazily acquire the module instance from the factory inside of the module. There is a relatively large cost to creating a new module instance (especially the first; due to config reading) that is being paid each time we just register the entire Bitbucket host provider. Whilst we are here also cleanup some of the styling/field naming in this class to be consistent with the rest of GCM. This saves approximately 120ms of startup time.

6,Fix several UI bugs in 2.1 pre-release (#1238),Fix a few bugs that were spotted during testing of the 2.1 pre-release:  Missing Atlassian logo resource from the compiled binaries Remote URL is shown even for Bitbucket cloud with in-proc GUI In-proc basic auth GUI user name field should only be set if non-null or whitespace  Also bump the VERSION to 2.1.1 in the expectation for this to replace 2.1.0.
7,version: bump to 2.1.1.0,
8,basic-auth: only set username if not-null,
9,bitbucket: only show URL if not Bitbucket Cloud,Only show the URL if the remote is NOT Bitbucket Cloud in the in-proc UI. This is same behaviour as the helper UI.
10,bitbucket: include Atlassian logo resource,Make sure to include the Atlassian logo as an AvaloniaResource so it's included in the compiled binaries.
11,Merge branch 'release' into main,
12,Add support for using the current Windows user for WAM on DevBox (#1197),"Add the ability to configure MSAL to use the default OS account when the broker is enabled. Also detect when we are in a Microsoft Dev Box environment, and if we are, then default to enabling the new setting (and enable WAM). Show a confirmation prompt before continuing to use the current OS account, which is similar to how Microsoft Teams operates. image Left: Avalonia UI, Right: fallback WPF window Fixes #917"

15,versioning: transition from nerdbank to version file (#1231),"With the link, it became clear that link was no longer an option for versioning the project. This is because module requires history to calculate things like link, and the formula requires a tarball to build, which, of course, has no history. This change pivots GCM to the simpler strategy of using a version specified in a module file at root. This version will be updated by maintainers prior to release - giving them more granular control of versioning, which in turn allows for versioning to be more predictable (i.e. maintainers will know what the version will be before publication of the release). The version specified in the file is the one slated for the next release: module. Note: This change link due to a link unless we ensure all projects have at least 1 dependency. We are working around this issue by adding Newtonsoft.Json as this dependency (since we were already shipping it anyway)."
16,workflows: update checkout actions,"Remove fetch-depth from checkout actions, since that was required by Nerdbank.GitVersioning. Also take this opportunity to use consistent version and naming for checkout actions."
17,version: remove nerdbank tasks,Remove Nerdbank.GitVersioning tasks (which have been superceded by the use of the new VERSION file) from the release workflow.
18,version: update release workflow versioning,"Update release workflow to use VERSION file for versioning, rather than Nerdbank.GitVersioning."
19,version: replace nerdbank with version file,"Remove Nerdbank.GitVersioning dependency from project in favor of a new VERSION file, which will be updated ahead of each release. Versioning in this file will begin with the version we plan to use for the next release: 2.1.0.0. This change involves the addition of a new custom MSBuild task, which reads in the contents of the VERSION file, converts it to a Version object, and then sets the various version-related MSBuild properties with the correct value (some with the module component appended, others without). Note that there is a bug in MSAL link that causes build failures for projects without dependencies with this change. We add Newtonsoft.Json as a global dependency in Directory.Build.props to work around this problem until the fix is released."

26,docs: add link to dotnet sdk,"Add link to the install instructions for the dotnet SDK. Note that, due to installation instructions differing based on the distro and version users are running, the best we are able to do is link to the page that provides further links for users to follow to use their respective package managers to install."

29,Make Avalonia UI the default on all platforms and move in-process (#1207),"Today GCM has an architecture that delegates all GUI prompting to (bundled) external executables, using WPF-based helpers on Windows and Avalonia UI helpers on Mac and Linux. Each host provider has its own GUI helper executable, meaning we currently bundle four (GitHub.UI, GitLab.UI, Atlassian.Bitbucket.UI, git-credential-manager.ui [for generic auth]) helpers in addition to the core git-credential-manager CLI executable. On Linux we use the ""publish as a single-file"" model for each of these executables, meaning we have a copy of the CLR included for each executable! That means five CLRs! Now that the Avalonia UI-based GUI helpers have matured, we can look at dropping the WPF helpers and reduce the effort required to ship new GUI by 50% (we no longer need to do everything twice: once with WPF and once with Avalonia UI). In addition, in a recent spike, I found that it may be possible to bring the Avalonia UI helpers in-process, with nearly zero net-new code. This would help reduce our installation footprint on Linux down to approximately 1/4 of the current size. The single executable model would also help decrease build times, and increase end-user performance since we no longer pay the process startup costs using external processes! We need to be mindful that this change may result in a small increase in the Windows installation as we now bring in extra libraries used to support Avalonia UI, whereas previously we relied on WPF libraries as included with Windows 'for free'. This is expected to be minimal. As for the current GUI extensibility model, we are not aware of any consumers, but it would not be much effort to keep the existing external process model, but now just default to using our in-process GUI options in the absence of external configuration. This still gives tools like VS or VSCode options to integrate native UI for GCM in the future. Initially, we are still keeping the WPF helpers around on Windows but disabled by default. We can drop these after at least one release using the in-proc Avalonia helpers. To switch back to the WPF helpers, use module or module."

42,gitlab: simplify terminal/interaction checks,"Simplify where we check for user interaction and/or terminal prompts during authentication, to only need to check at the start of each module call. Note that is is a behaviour change - we now require user interaction to be allowed to perform authentication even with only 1 mode available. This is technically more 'correct' because when the user disables interactivity, we should never require interaction to continue. Although we are not asking the user to select a mode of authentication, we still either need them to enter a username/password, or respond to a browser OAuth flow."

71,Update MSAL libraries and use new MSALRuntime-based broker implementation (#1191),"Use the new Windows broker which is based on the MSALRuntime; an export wrapper around a native, cross-platform MSAL library. In this new set up, we drop the module package in favour of the module package that also means we drop the WebView2Loader.dll, which we didn't make use of anyway. There are a few new binaries to be distributed in the new model, including a P/Invoke layer, IdentityModel abstractions library, and the native module. Note that GCM still only support x86 on Windows, and only supports broker use on Windows. For this reason we don't bother adding the broker package on non-.NET Framework builds to keep the sizes on Mac/Linux to a minimum. Also update the MSAL extensions library whilst we are here to pick up various bug fixes, and drop workarounds that are no longer required for this new broker implementation!"

78,docs: update configure command for install from source,The current install from source instructions are out of date - they still recommend using module rather than module. Update the documentation to instruct users to run the correct command.
79,msauth: always set the parent window for MSAL,"Always set the parent window handle for MSAL on Windows. Previously we only set this if provided a handle by the user/config. Now however we must always try and provide a handle because using the new MSALRuntime-based Windows broker means we must do so - MSAL no longer provides us with a 'dummy' handle to use. Use the parent console window handle, as recommended by the MSAL docs: https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/wam#parent-window-handles"
80,msauth: use new Windows broker based on MSALRuntime,"Use the new Windows broker which is based on the MSALRuntime; an export wrapper around a native, cross-platform MSAL library. In this new set up, we drop the module package in favour of the module package that also means we drop the WebView2Loader.dll, which we didn't make use of anyway. There are a few new binaries to be distrubuted in the new model, including a P/Invoke layer, IdentityModel abstractions library, and the native msalruntime_x86.dll. Note that GCM still only support x86 on Windows, and only supports broker use on Windows. For this reason we don't bother adding the broker package on non-.NET Framework builds to keep the sizes on Mac/Linux to a minimium."

82,Fix app path name of Windows dropping file extension (#1181),"During some refactoring we accidentially introduced an error in the 'app path' on the CommandContext`; rather than trimming the file extension off (for detection of the old executable name on Windows) on a local copy, we are now updating the app wide copy!

88,Target *-latest runner images in CI workflow (#1178),"We are using the module runner images for release builds (link, link), but for CI we're instead using module, module, and module (alongside module). Let's run CI against the latest of all three OS images to match what we're using to build release bits. Ubuntu 18.04 is also link as a GitHub hosted runner."
89,workflows: target *-latest runner images,"We are using the *-latest runner images for release builds, but for CI we're instead using ubuntu-18.04, ubuntu-20.04, and windows-2019 (alongside macos-latest). Let's run CI against the latest of all three OS images to match what we're using to build release bits."
90,Cache Git configuration used in Settings for the lifetime of the process (#1172),"When enumerating all Git configuration values in module, we currently cache a copy of all values for the lifetime of the module method. This saves us some calls to Git, but we can do better. Pull-up the cache of Git configuration entries to the lifetime of the module object, meaning all calls to module over the lifetime of the process can benefit from the cache! The savings here can be significant as each module property typically results in a call to module. Whilst in this space we can fix a couple of bugs:   We were not calling module for module variables when resolving settings, and instead consulting the cache first. We always want to go to Git for these types of values.   We were not using the existing cache for unscoped entries!   In my limited testing this results in a 2-3x speedup in calls to module!"
91,settings: replace module with module when we know,"We have already checked module is true before calling module, so let's just pass module in these calls."
92,settings: cache Git config values across process,"When enumerating all Git configuration values in module, we currently cache a copy of all values for the lifetime of the module method.

The savings here can be significant as each module property typically results in a call to module."
93,settings: use cached Git config entries for unscoped vars,"Use the cached copy of Git configuration entries not only for URL-scoped keys, but unscoped keys too!"
94,settings: fix bug in path-type setting reading,"If we are asked for a path-type setting then we should always consult Git directly for the value, and not used cached copies of values that were acquired using module without a module parameter."
95,trace2: add regions (#1162),"Add module region tracing capability. The first six commits contain minor refactors, bug fixes, and cleanups. The first moves Trace2 messages into their own file. The second removes the unnecessary module method. The third fixes certain conflated timing information in module and module events. The fourth ensures we're writing exit message times in UTC. The fifth adds descriptive comments to Trace2-related classes that did not yet have them. The sixth adds best-effort logic to capture thread names. The next three commits are dedicated to preparing for and adding region-related logic. The seventh commit updates custom performance format span handling to account for the repo and category fields, which are used in region tracing. The eighth adds region-related events, encapsulated in a class that inherits from module (which in turn inherits from module). The ninth adds region tracing to methods of interest pertaining to OAuth authentication. The final commit updates GCM's documentation to inform users of how to enable and utilize Trace2 tracing. A final note: This implementation does not support nested regions, as it is not required for the current regions of interest."
96,trace2: documentation,Document how users can set up and utilize the Trace2 API.
97,trace2: add regions to OAuth,Add region tracing to key methods in OAuth2Client. This was deemed a good starting point for regions due to the server interaction required to obtain tokens. Additional regions can and should be added to additional sections of the code that are deemed performance-critical in the future.
98,trace2: add region infrastructure,"Add supporting infrastructure for regions. This includes the normal module methods in Trace2 and corresponding Trace2 messages with a few notable distinctions:  There is an abstract parent RegionMessage that inherits from Trace2Message. The RegionEnterMessage and RegionLeave messages inherit from this parent (rather than Trace2Message) to maximize reuse of shared fields. We create a new Region class that implements DisposableObject and call it using a CreateRegion method in Trace2. This ensures that we call WriteRegionLeave before a Region object is disposed - a key requirement of Git's Trace2 API for regions.  Additionally, it allows us to manage getting the executing thread name and region timings within the class, thus removing this burden from consumers.  An additional note is that the region_enter and region_leave events will always have the same line number with this model. This was deemed to be acceptable, however, given that knowing where a region begins executing provides enough information for inspection of the region if it is needed."
99,trace2: update span handling,"Previously, we only set up custom performance format span handling for time-related information (see [1]). However, with the upcoming introduction of regions, we will need custom spans for the category and repo strings. This change refactors and adds to the current logic to correctly handle all 3 span types (i.e. time, repo, and category). [1] 59a2692"
100,trace2: capture thread name,"With the upcoming introduction of regions, we will need to capture thread names. This change adds a new static BuildThreadName() method that defines a thread name by:  Determining if it is the entry thread and, if so, calling it ""main"", per Trace2 convention. If it's not the main thread, determining whether it is a thread pool thread and naming it with a static prefix and the thread pool thread id. If it is not the entry thread or a thread pool thread, use the thread name, if it has one. Return an empty string if none of the above are true."
101,trace2: add comments,Add descriptive comments to Trace2-related classes that currently do not have any.
102,trace2: exit message time in utc,We are currently writing exit message times in local rather than UTC time. This change updates to UTC time to align with the expectations of the Trace2 API.
103,trace2: fix child process time recording,"Currently, we are recording child process times incorrectly for the performance format target. This change fixes that by:  Ensuring we're recording the absolute time in child_start messages for the performance format target, which we previously were not doing. Ensures we do not conflate the absolute and relative times in child_exit, which we were previously doing."
104,trace2: remove adddots method,"In Git, dots are only used on nested region messages, which are currently not supported in GCM. Remove the AddDots() method that is used incorrectly for formatting child process messages."
105,trace2: messages in new file,"Move Trace2 messages into a new file. The Trace2 file was getting a bit long and unwieldy, so this change is intended to separate it in a logical way into two smaller files that are (hopefully) easier to parse and reason about."
106,docs: call out different GCM install paths in WSL docs (#1168),"Add a callout to the fact the exact location of GCM may differ depending on the Git for Windows version/installation options, in our WSL docs."
107,Ensure we init IEnvironment before SessionManager (#1167),Ensure we have an instance of IEnvironment before we pass it to the SessionManager contructor. Also add some null guards to catch this problem earlier in the future.

109,commandcontext: ensure we init IEnvironment before SessionManager,Ensure we have an instance of IEnvironment before we pass it to the SessionManager contructor. Also add some null guards to catch this problem earlier in the future.
110,trace2: add error event (#1156),"This series adds the module error event. The first two commits are opportunistic fixes that remove unnecessary components of module messages. The next four commits add module as a dependency to certain classes where exceptions are thrown in order to capture those exceptions with the new error event. The seventh commit adds the error event, and eighth adds special exceptions that write to module. Finally, the ninth commit adds error tracing exceptions and messages throughout the GCM codebase."
111,trace2: add error tracing statements,"Add TRACE2 error tracing statements throughout GCM codebase. Note that this is a best effort - there are certain places (most notably certain static and unsafe methods) where statements were purposefully not added because it is either not safe or was deemed to much lift/churn to do so. Note that there are some instances in which a ""parameterized"" message is passed to TRACE2. This is used only when PII information could be passed into the message (e.g. through a path or remote URI) and should be redacted for collection purposes. Finally, there are certain instances in which we write an error with no exception thrown. These align with the places where we are currently writing to GCM Trace without throwing an error for the purposes of parity."
112,trace2: add exceptions,"Add exceptions for which TRACE2 tracing can optionally be used. We choose to add these exceptions to ease the experience of writing TRACE2 error information - instead of having to add a call to Trace2's WriteError() message before every exception of interest, one can instead just use the appropriate Trace2 exception."
113,trace2: add error event,"Add error event, which will capture exceptions, to Trace2 tracing system."
114,trace2: pass to GPG,"Pass instance of Trace2 to Gpg in preparation for capturing exceptions, which will be added in a future commit."
115,trace2: pass to terminal classes,"Pass instance of Trace2 to terminal classes in preparation for capturing exceptions, which will be added in a future commit."
116,trace2: pass to Git,"Pass instance of Trace2 to Git in preparation for capturing exceptions, which will be added in a future commit."
117,trace2: pass to OAuth2Client,"Pass instance of Trace2 to OAuth2Client in preparation for capturing exceptions, which will be added in a future commit. Note that this also removes the unused instance of Trace in GCM's OAuth2 infrastructure."
118,trace2: remove order from json properties,"Order was originally included for each TRACE2 json property to ensure alignment with Git's TRACE2 json property ordering. However, given that the json output is meant for consumption only by tooling (e.g. the OTel Collector) andi that the order requirement adds overhead with each new message, this change removes it."
119,trace2: remove ToLower() from message file names,"TRACE2 convention does not require file names to be lowercase. Remove the ToLower() call when setting messages' FileName properties, as it it unnecessary."
120,trace2: add performance format target (#1151),"This series adds the performance format target for TRACE2 tracing. The first two patches are small fixes for bugs I noticed as I was testing the performance format target. The first moves the module enum from the specific module class to the shared module class. The second ensures the normal format event names are written in snake case (rather than lowercase). The third patch adds the ability to get the ""depth"" of the process. Because Sids and depth are process-related concepts, it removes the SidManager class and moved depth/sid-related properties and methods into the ProcessManager class. The fourth patch adds the performance format target. It includes a few notable components:  A new GetMessage method to ensure message strings written to normal and performance targets are not duplicated. A new PerformanceFormatComponent class to track sizing of optional properties of performance format messages. A BuildSpan method that Trace2Message children use to create correctly-sized ""spans"" for optional properties of performance format messages. A span is a piece of the message beginning with a pipe (|) and ending just before the next pipe or the end of the message. A BuildTimeSpan method that adjusts spans for long/short times. In future, when we have events that include performance format string span components, we will need to add an additional method to handle them."
121,Assume GitHub Enterprise instances with a null version number support OAuth (#1154),"Enterprise instances that return a null version are considered to support OAuth. Only disable OAuth as an option if we can verify we are talking to an old Enterprise Server. This is a less fragile option as we never block the user from using an auth method they could use, and don't need to special case GHAE."
122,github: enterprise instances w/ null ver support OAuth,Enterprise instances that return a null version are considered to support OAuth.
123,Better browser/interactive session detection inside of WSL (#1148),"Today we're gating browser-based authentication mechanisms behind a GUI-possible session, which isn't 100% correct. When inside of a WSL session, without WSLg enabled, it is still possible to launch a web browser in the hosting Windows session. Split the determination between ""GUI session"" and ""browser possible"", and add the special case for WSL inside an interactive Windows session. Things are complicated here because it is possible to SSH in to the WSL instance from outside of the Windows host, meaning the Windows session also doesn't have UI. This case we still need to prevent browser-based options. In order to detect these cases we need to 'punch out' to the Windows host and run a script/cmdlet to determine the session type. Fixes #878"
124,http: add support for client certificates (#1152),"Add support for automatically sending client TLS certificates using the Git configuration setting 'http.sslAutoClientCert'. This setting is currently only link, and there is only respected when the SSL backend is ""schannel"". Fixes #369"
125,trace2: add performance format target,"Add the performance format target for TRACE2 tracing. This change includes a few notable components:  A new GetMessage method to ensure message strings written to normal and performance targets are not duplicated. A new PerformanceFormatComponent class to track sizing of optional properties of performance format messages. A BuildSpan method that Trace2Message children use to create correctly-sized ""spans"" for optional properties of performance format messages. A span is a piece of the message beginning with a pipe (|) and ending just before the next pipe or the end of the message. A BuildTimeSpan method that adjusts spans for long/short times. In future, when we have events that include performance format string span components, we will need to add an additional method to handle them."
126,trace2: add process depth calculation,"The performance format target requires recording of process depth. We use the number of forward slashes in the process's sid as a convenient way to determine this. Because the sid and the depth are process-related concepts, this change also moves sid/depth related properties into ProcessManager.cs and removes the SidManager.cs class."
127,http: add support for client certificates,"Add support for automatically sending client TLS certificates using the Git configuration setting 'http.sslAutoClientCert'. This setting is currently only present in Git for Windows, and there is only respected when the SSL backend is ""schannel""."
128,trace2: write normal format events in snake case,"A previous patch link added the ability to write strings in snake case. However, this was not applied to writing events in the normal format - events that should be written as child_start or child_exit are currently written as childstart and childexit. This patch corrects this issue."
129,trace2: move formattargettypes,"Move the FormatTargetTypes enum from the specific Trace2StreamWriter class to the shared Trace2Writer class, since the Trace2FileWriter class also uses values from this enum."
130,wsl: detect host Windows session 0 and disable browser,"In order to detect if we have an interactive Windows desktop session from inside WSL we need to 'punch out' from WSL to determine the session ID and window station. Strictly speaking, except for session 0 (from Vista onwards), any Windows session can have exactly one interactive window station (always called WinSta0). However, because we cannot easily determine the window station name from a simple cmd/powershell script, we take a simplified approach which isn't 100% accurate. Instead, we only permit browser auth methods if we are NOT in Windows session 0; any other Windows session we assume we are in WinSta0. The default OpenSSH Server configuration (Windows 10+) has module running as the built-in NT user NETWORK_SERVICE, which means it runs in session 0 (the services session). This is most common scenario, other than using WSL from a 'real', interactive Windows session that we're likely to face."
131,wsl: add ability to run CMD/PowerShell scripts from WSL,Add ability to launch cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe scripts from inside a WSL distribution. In order to discover the location of cmd.exe/powershell.exe we need search the Windows file system that's mounted by default /mnt/c. We inspect the /etc/wsl.conf file to respect users who have changed the default mount location for Windows drives.
132,ini: add basic INI file deserialiser,Add a basic INI file deserialiser
133,wsl: add ability to detect WSL distro and version,"Add methods to the WslUtils class to enable detection of a WSL distribution, and also determine which WSL version is being used. Version 1 uses the Windows NT kernel and runs the distribution in the same user-mode space as Windows programs. Version 2 uses a light-weight VM to host a real Linux kernel, and runs the distribution also inside the VM; interop with Windows is achieved using other mechanisms."
134,browser: split browser-check from desktop session check,Split the web browser check from the desktop session checks. In future commits we will enhance the browser-check to take in to account the WSL special case.
135,fs: add abstractions for reading all text and enum dir,Add abstractions to the IFileSystem interface for enumerating directories and reading the entire contents of a file to a string.
136,posix-session: check for Wayland display envars,Also check for the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable when determining if a graphical session/display exists for POSIX systems.
137,env: avoid virtual member call in ctor; all refresh,"We had a virtual member call in the constructor of the various IEnvironment implementations, which is a code smell. Instead, lazily populate the module cache dictionary, and add an explict module method to refresh the cache. We call module in the module method for convenience. For testing we simply pipe through the pre-computed variables in the module constructor."
138,settings: support scoped enterprise settings (#1149),Add support for remote URL-scoped enterprise default settings. Fixes #983
139,settings: support scoped enterprise settings,Add support for remote URL-scopes enterprise default settings.
140,Ensure we create a module on Windows (#1146),"We are creating a module implementation on macOS and a non-Windows/WSL aware, plain module on Windows - this is the reverse of what we should do. Fix this."
141,procmgr: ensure we create a WindowsProcessManager on Windows,"We are creating a module implementation on macOS and a non-Windows/WSL aware, plain module on Windows - this is the reverse of what we should do. Fix this."
142,trace2: add child start and exit events (#1131),"This change adds the module and module events to GCM's module tracing system. The first patches are either bug fixes or prep for the bigger refactors involved in making child start and exit work. The first patch puts sid-related logic into its own class, which allows us to immediately set up GCM's sid in module to ensure Git processes that are executed before module tracing is set up have the correct parent sid. The next patch adds a module class and uses it (rather than module) to write to files, which ensures processes aren't overwriting one another's data. The third patch adds a snake casing string extension to ensure we write multi-word enum values according to the module convention. The fourth patch ensures we do not redirect stderr for Git-related processes, as it was discovered to cause deadlocks when module was enabled. The fifth patch refactors GCM's diagnostics to depend on an instance of module rather than individual dependencies within module. The sixth patch re-configures module to depend on an instance of module rather than individual dependencies within module, to start up earlier, and for operations to no-op if module has not yet been initialized (i.e. when child module processes run before we're able to set up tracing). The seventh patch wraps module to give us the needed level of control to write module child process start and exit events. The eighth patch (finally) adds the new child start and exit events."
143,trace2: add child_start and child_exit events,Write the TRACE2 child_start and child_exit events for each child process invoked by GCM.
144,trace2: add process wrapper,"Wrap the Process class to allow finer-grained control for writing future process-related TRACE2 events. Pull process-relevant information out of IEnvironment/Environment and into its own process-oriented ProcessManager class, interface, and child classes. This allows us to  maintain a functional, non-circular order of dependencies with our process wrapper. Add a ChildProcess class to wrap certain functionality of Process.cs. This gives us the level of control required to write child process information to TRACE2 in the final patch in this series. Update all current invocations of Process to instead use this wrapper."
145,trace2: refactor to prepare for child process-related events,"The TRACE2 child start and child exit events will require some refactoring around the way GCM handles processes to provide finer-grained control and the ability to capture process-related information. In preparation for this, we need to do some re-organization of the Trace2 code. With this change we:  Move TRACE2 tracing startup into Program.cs for GCM and the helper exes. This allows us to start tracing earlier and capture more events. Add an Initialize() method to Trace2.cs to detect whether Trace2 tracing is enabled and set long-lived variables. This also sets a new _initialized property that allows us to determine whether Trace2 tracing has been initialized. Trace2 tracing is disabled until _initialized is set to true by the Initialize() method. Change the name of TryParseSettings() to InitializeWriters() for improved clarity. Pass the CommandContext to Trace2 to use its Streams and Environment."
146,trace2: refactor diagnostics,"Diagnostics classes are dependent on multiple pieces of the CommandContext. Adding child start and child exit events will mean yet another dependency (Trace2). To simplify in anticipation of this, update Diagnostic classes to take in the CommandContext and access applicable dependencies from it."
147,trace2: redirect standard error,"When a new process is created, standard error can optionally be redirected. This is useful in situations where the output is verbose and should be suppressed rather than output to the console, for example. However, this can cause an issue with TRACE2 deadlocks, as Git writes to standard error and GCM does nothing. This change corrects this by not redirecting standard error for Git-related processes (which also extends to places such as Environment.cs, given Git's reliance on envars). Finally, there are some places where we should still redirect standard error for the reason mentioned above. For these scenarios, comments have been added to help readers understand the purposeful nature of these redirects."
148,trace2: add string extension for snake casing,"The TRACE2 convention is for multi-word event names to be written in snake case (all lower case with words separated by underscores). While up until this point we've had single-word event names, this series will add the multi-word child start and child exit events. In anticipation of that, this change adds a string extension that will be used in later patches to write multi-word enum values in snake case."
149,trace2: add file writer,"Our current strategy of using a Stream to write to files for Trace2 tracing is not working - Git processes are overwriting GCM's data and vice versa. To resolve this, switch from using the Trace2StreamWriter to write to files to a dedicated Trace2FileWriter class. This also includes a refactor to add a parent base class for Trace2Writers for shared functaionality between the Trace2StreamWriter and Trace2FileWriter."
150,trace2: create sid manager class,"Create static class to manage session ids (sids). This allows us to immediately set up GCM's sid in Program.cs to ensure Git processes that are executed before Trace2 tracing is set up have the correct parent sid. We also use it to give helper exes unique child sids. Although this will also execute when TRACE2 tracing is not enabled, it should not be an issue - it will simply set the (unused) GIT_TRACE2_PARENT_SID varible for the process to a GUID."

This can help users of multiple accounts select the correct account before the OAuth flow completes and returns a token for the wrong account. GitHub shows this nice prompt when a login hint is provided that does not match the currently logged-in user: image At the same time, if there is no logged-in user, then the login page's username box is already filled in: image The login hint is specified to GitHub via the extra module query parameter to the authorization endpoint."
156,uri: support ports and split queries/fragments from path (#825),"GCM currently ignores ports in URIs. This means attempting to authenticate to a URI with a port can lead to some unexpected behavior (e.g. shortcutting the provider auto-detect process won't work, even if the provider is set in config). This change adds support for ports by updating GetGitConfigurationScopes() to recognize them. This change also updates GetRemoteUri() to recognize paths with queries and fragments, as that issue was uncovered during the implementation of the GetGitConfigurationScopes() fix. Without it, input paths containing queries and/or fragments get saved as part of Uri.Path, which converts the query '?' and the fragment '#' to url encoding. I validated these changes with unit tests for applicable scenarios and by running a locally-compiled version of GCM with tracing enabled and the  following config set: module Trace logs showed that the override was recognized and auto-detection was skipped."

In light of this, update the .NET tool install instructions to specify that users must download the latest .NET 6.0 SDK as a prerequisite for installing the package, since that is the framework for which we currently publish. This will also need to be updated whenever we upgrade to a new Target Framework. Additionally, remove Windows as a supported .NET tool platform.

This method should just check to see whether TRACE2 is enabled - if it is not, it does not need to warn the user, as we only collect traces from those who actively choose to opt in. Additionally, GCM's UI helpers are connected to the TRACE2 system via the Start() call in module. Since this call records module and module events, ensure a corresponding module event is called before the helper process completes."
172,"trace2: add default thread name value of ""main""","The TRACE2 convention for thread naming is for each child process's main thread of execution to be named ""main."" In GCM, however, we encountered an issue with our UI Helper exes - their main threads of execution are named AppMain. To temporarily work around this issue, we default the thread name for all TRACE2 events to ""main"" (rather than changing GCM's process names). This will do for our current events, which are all called from the main thread of execution. However, it is important to note that future events (i.e. regions) will require deeper thought around the GCM/TRACE2 process model, as they will be called on threads from .NET's ThreadPool rather than the main thread of execution."

Additionally, write the TRACE2 start event, which reflects the elapsed time and application arguments (including the application name). These are paired because the telemetry tool/OTel collector require both these events to be sent for a given session."
184,trace2: detect event/normal formats,"Add the infrastructure to detect whether a user has enabled the TRACE2 event format or normal format targets.

185,trace2: add sid,"A key component of Git's TRACE2 tracing system is the session id (sid). This identifies the process instance to allow all events emitted by it to be identified. We check to see if a parent sid (i.e. from a Git process) exists. If so, we separate this sid from the GCM sid (a GUID) using a ""/"". If there is no parent sid, we simply generate a GUID for the GCM sid and use that. The above also requires addition of a new SetEnvironmentVariable() method in EnvironmentBase.cs to set the GCM-specific SID variable."

241,app: fix Windows app-path resolution,"Fix another bug in how we compute the Application Executable path on Windows. It some cases we can still get a relative/non-absolute path to the entry executable. If we get a filename/non-path from the native API calls then return null and fallback to using process/module image resolution instead. For .NET Framework on Windows, this is OK. We will want to revisit this on .NET (Core) on Windows, if and when we get around to that..."
242,app: fix bug in oldname warning on Windows,"Fix a bug in the old-name warning detection that only presents on Windows when bundled with Git for Windows, and when configured using the shorthand config module. In this scenario, our argv[0] is missing the "".exe"" extension (that's actually present in the file name of course) because ... mingw reasons. Instead of matching ""git-credential-manager-core.exe"" on Windows, just strip "".exe"" if present on Windows, and always match ""git-credential-manager-core"" on all platforms."
243,app: fix installation dir calculation,"On Windows, when invoked as a partial name (e.g., module) our command line argv[0] is just a file name, not a full file path! We incorrectly assumed that module was always absolute! We should instead use module that, in all circumstances tested, all on TFMs and OSs, all publish options, and as a .NET tool... returns the expected full, absolute path to the installation directory."
244,env: ensure we don't return empty PATH vars on Windows,"Ensure that we don't return empty module values on Windows when splitting. It's common that on Windows the module can be inadvertently modified such that an empty value is included, and this can lead to weird resolution of executables using the current directory. As it stands, no existing codepaths would trigger this today when invoked by Git for Windows, but let's make sure this never happens in the future by mistake!"
245,authbase: gracefully handle no-default UI helper case,"If there is no hard-coded UI helper, we should gracefully handle the lookup by returning false, rather than crashing due to a argument exception when passing module or an empty string to a Path API."

251,Fix problems with application path and installation directory resolution (#951),"When we introduced the rename warning in #551, there was broken logic for resolving the actual invoked program name on Mac and Linux. Windows We continue to use module to return the absolute, full path to the entry executable. macOS Switch from module to module which, like the Windows APIs above, returns the full path to the entry executable (or symlink). Linux As there is no equivalent to module or module here, we instead do some path computation based on the form of module that we get from module. - If the value is an absolute path, just use that. - If the value is relative to the current directory (module) then combine this with the current directory. - If the value contains a directory separator (module) then also resolve this from the current directory. - Otherwise, this module value must have been a file name (module) resolved from the module. If we still don't manage to resolve from the module, try and resolve the symlink module that points to the executable image that was loaded from disk. Note that we may miss any intermediate link names here, but it's better than nothing.  In addition, we also never tested the .NET Tool scenario after updating the module to use the entry executable name, whereas previously this was computed from the .NET assembly path. Introduce a separate concept, the module that always points to the home of the core assemblies. This is used for resolving things like in-box UI helpers."
252,libsecret: fix warning with move to net6.0 TFM,"Moving to target .NET 6 directly with the core library has unearthed a bug/warning in the secret service implementation. IntPtr is a value type, so it can never be null.. we should have been comparing this pointer to module."
253,argv0: fix implementation of getting native argv[0],"Our previous implementation of getting the native argv[0] was flawed on Linux and Mac. The Mac module and Linux module function/proc-file return the raw argv[0] which may not be an absolute or rooted path, but we expected this to be the same. Additionally, the logic of appending the CWD to the argv[0] value when the latter wasn't rooted was also just wrong! Update to now use module on macOS, which always returns the full absolute path, and add correct handling of unrooted argv[0] on Linux. Furthermore, on Linux, if we are unable to handle the value from /proc/self/cmdline, we fall back to resolving the /proc/self/exe symlink instead."
254,apppath: introduce ICommandContext.InstallationDirectory,"Introduce a new property on the ICommandContext that represents the GCM installation directory, separate from the application executable path. The app executable is not always found in the installation directory if the app exe path is a symlink (or we're a .NET tool where the AppHost is outside of the tool store)."
255,fs: resolve symlinks and fix bugs in *FileSystem impls,"There is a systematic bug in all the IFileSystem implementations in that we were incorrectly calling module rather than module, meaning we're only comparing the file names of two paths for equality! Fix this. For Mac and Linux we also handle symlinks (or firmlinks) by now using the .NET APIs to resolve links. On .NET Framework we don't do anything."

317,Issue 573 Add support for OAuth2 for Bitbucket DC,New implementations of the interface IBitbucketRestApi and abstract class BitbucketOAuth2Client provide client code for interacting with the Bitbucket DC REST API and OAuth2 implementation. Extending the BitbucketRestApiRegistry and OAuth2ClientRegistry to provide these Bitbucket DC implementations when a DC host is detected means BitbucketAuthentication and BitbucketHostProvider remain agnostic about which form of Bitbcuket host they are interacting with Prior to this feature users were limited to using Basic Auth or HTTP Access Tokens to interact securely with a Bitbucket DC instance. OAuth2 provides a better solution for SSO environments
318,Issue 573 Refactor Bitbucket implementation to allow for the support of Bitbucket DC's OAuth2 implementation,The BitbucketAuthentication and BitbucketHostProvider remain the single points of entry to processing authentication for all Bitbucket hosts. Bitbucket DC and Bitbucket Cloud do not share common REST APIs or common OAuth2 implementations. The interface IBitbucketRestApi and abstract class BitbucketOAuth2Client effectively hide the differences in implementation from BitbucketAuthentication and BitbucketHostProvider The interface IBitbucketRestApi and abstract class BitbucketOAuth2Client provide clear extension points to implement OAuth2 support for Bitbucket DC

Additionally, actually now store the non-default port number in the target URI if there is one given. We also now always trim any trailing '/' from the end of the path of a service/target URI. Previously we erronously only trimmed the '/' from a 'pathless' URI, i.e.: https://example.com/      => https://example.com   https://example.com/path/ => https://example.com/path/ This is a safe change since the module method that is used by both module and module already matches both trailing and non-trailing slashes by virtue of creating and comparing components of a module which does normalisation of the path. Both module and module would act (eventually) to remove any bad credentials stored with a trailing slash, even if new credentials are only written out without the slash."

This meant the check would be run for Bitbucket Cloud and DC regardless. It would fail for Bitbucket DC The fix is more radical than simply re-instating the check on the type of Bitbucket host. From 1st March 2022 support for using a Bitbucket Cloud user's account password to access REST or Git HTTPS operations has been removed, https://atlassian.community/t5/x/x/ba-p/1948231.

667,Merge pull request #508 from julescubtree/update-contributing-guide,Fix CONTRIBUTING.md link to LICENSE
668,settings: match curl lowercase proxy envar behaviour,"libcurl supports multiple different environment variables [1] to configure proxy behaviour: http_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy, and no_proxy. Unlike most other environment variables these proxy envars are normally lowercase, not uppercase. This convention was set by libwww back in the early 1990s. When libcurl was first released however, it was not aware of this schism and only implemented checks for uppercase variants of these envars: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. In time, libcurl learned to also read the lowercase variants, and gives them precedence over the uppercase forms (since the former are quasi- standards). However, to further complicate the matter, libcurl no longer reads the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable specifically. This change was made to address a security concern with some CGI webservers [2]. The problem is that today GCM only reads the uppercase variants of the environment variables! This is inconsistent with libcurl, and therefore Git's behaviour (that we aim to be consistent/co-operative with). We change GCM's behaviour to match that of libcurl/Git in that the lowercase proxy envars are preferred to the uppercase ones, and the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable is ignored. Dropping support for the HTTP_PROXY uppercase envar is technically a breaking change, but if the user had only set this uppercase envar then Git would not be proxying the actual remote calls, only GCM, which is most likely not what the user wanted.

671,proxy: match NO_PROXY formats to libcurl behaviour,"We aim to be compatible with the behaviour of Git as much as possible when it comes to network settings. This enables users to setup Git proxy settings and get the same setup ""for free"" with GCM. Git uses libcurl to provide it's HTTP interactions. The NO_PROXY setting is used by libcurl to disable proxy settings for specific hosts. We previously attempted to plumb the value of NO_PROXY through to the .NET WebProxy class' list of ""bypassed addresses"" (the set of hosts that should not be proxied). However, the .NET class expects a set of regular expressions which is unlike libcurl! As a result, libcurl permitted values for NO_PROXY were throwing errors inside of GCM since they are not valid regexs. In this commit we perform a transformation of the NO_PROXY list and construct a set of regular expressions that match addresses in the same way as libcurl does. The transformation is as follows:  strip any leading periods '.' or wildcards '*.' escape the remaining input to match literally (e.g.: '.' becomes '.') prepend a group that matches either a period '.' or a URI scheme    delimiter '://' - this prevents partial domain matching append a end-of-string symbol '$' to ensure we only match to the    specified TLD and port  See the libcurl documentation on NO_PROXY behaviour: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOPROXY.html"

692,registry: speed up auto-detect and make more robust,"Speed up the auto-detection mechanism in the HostProviderRegistry by setting a short(er) timeout on the probing network call (2 seconds). The default value from the framework is otherwise 100 seconds(!). We introduce a setting for the user to be able to configure this timeout value with the granularity of 1 millisecond. Another problem that occured with this network call was crashes due to TLS configuration issues. The network call was not wrapped in a try-catch block which meant that the entire process would crash if there was a problem. This isn't ideal for what is supposed to be a ""best effort"" feature. Here we wrap the HEAD call in a try-catch and display an appropriate warning message to the user. For completeness, add documentation that explains the auto-detection feature, how to configure the timeout, and how to disable this network call."

Because of this we need to ""reserve"" thread 0 (the main entry thread) for running the Avalonia infrastructure, and kick off a new thread to run the rest of the ""normal"" .NET application logic (such as command-line handling). The dispatcher allows queuing of work to be run on the initialised thread, until the loop is terminated.

The workaround is to set the process COM security to ""none"" iif we are on Windows 10, the process is elevated, and the user hasn't disabled the broker. It is possible the call to CoInitializeSecurity may fail, as this can only be called once in the lifetime of a process, and must be called before any COM interactions occur. The CLR may perform some COM interop before we even get to the Main method(!) We try our best here and call the CoInitializeSecurity function as soon as we reasonably can in the lifetime of our process."

We now use the module method to get the raw underlying ""argv"" arguments, which argv[0] is the absolute file path to the entry executable.

However, Git itself when presented with this configuration will prompt the user for a username/password (which isn't required). Specifying an empty string username/password in the proxy configuration will stop Git from prompting for them, and allow cURL to auto-negotiate proxy auth.

In some instances it may be desirable for the user to force a particular flow, for instance to take advantage of browser sign-in state or OS integrations by using 'system'. If no option is set, or module is selected the existing behaviour is preserved (we pick for the user)."

This is currently uploaded as an artifact on the workflow itself but it not yet published. The 3rd and last build job yet to be added is using setting up yet another internal tool with the right security to use our internal publishing service.

The new single-user installer places files in %LOCALAPPDATA% and updates the ~/.gitconfig (global) user Git configuration instead.

1105,configuration: update config cmd to set full path,"Update the configure and unconfigure actions to now set the full file path to GCM Core, rather than rely on module resolving to module on the PATH by Git. This was a problem because Git for Windows now bundles GCM Core, and even if a standalone install of GCM Core was present on the system with a higher version, since the bundled copy is found on the PATH before anything else, Git was always picking the old one. The change to using full paths helps fix this issue, and also another issue on macOS where sometimes the /usr/local/bin directory is not on the PATH (such as for the root user, or during a postinstall script for a flat-package [.pkg] file)."

This indeed helps in the situation of this developer whose config is so large that module produces 25 kilobyte worth of output. Apparently, this fills up some buffer that seems to be around 8kB and then module waits for its output to be consumed, and before this patch, the consumer (i.e. GCM Core) would wait for module to exit already."

Some of these utilities do not disconnect child processes from our standard input/output/error streams. At the same time, browsers like Chromium like to write to stdout and stderr, which gets fed back to Git or the user's terminal, respectively. The latter looks messy, and the former causes Git to fail. On Linux, we instead manually locate a suitable 'shell execute' utility and launch them directly - this way we can redirect the standard output/error streams. For Windows and macOS, this is not an issue and we continue to use the Framework code to do 'shell execute'."

1155,azrepos: workaround org@ user hackery,"Now that we support multiple user accounts for each host/service/remote, we have hit an interesting issue with Azure Repos. With the introduction of the dev.azure.com-style URLs for Azure Repos there was an unfortunate hack or workaround invented to add the AzDevOps org name to the userinfo part of the remote URL, for example: org@dev.azure.com/org/blah. Since GCM for Windows (and older versions of GCM Core that initially followed the same model) always uses the value ""PersonalAccessToken"" for the username field when storing credentials it was free to ignore the user part of the input. The problem now is that since we support multiple user accounts, and will perform an exact match against the credential (with user) if a username is specified in the remote URL, we never find the credential we now store (we now always store with the actual, real users' UPN). To workaround this workaround (yuck) we ignore the username IF AND ONLY IF the host is dev.azure.com, and return the first matching dev.azure.com/org credential. The upshot of this is that dev.azure.com-style URLs do NOT support multiple users OR full paths, however vs.com-style URLs will."

1261,windows: compile to 32-bit x86 only,"Since we want to ship with Git for Windows which offers both an x86 and x86_64 option, we should build an x86 (32-bit) application rather than an x86_64 (64-bit) one. Since 32-bit applications can run on 64-bit versions of Windows (including Windows on ARM) this is the more compatible target. We could also publish both a 32- and 64-bit build of GCM Core on Windows but this seems redundant as GCM Core really does not need 64-bits of addressable memory(!)"

1355,Return to building 64-bit in NetCore and NetFx on Windows,Now that we've moved the Microsoft authentication helper in-process we no longer have a need to force all entry executables to be the same bit-width. The GitHub authentication helper is still .NET Framework (as we're targeting .NET Core 2.x still) and using 32-bit WinForms. However that helper does not make use of the LibGit2 native bits (by virtue of not instantiating the module type).
1356,Move Microsoft authentication in-proc,Move Microsoft authentication in-process when no external helper application is present. This simplifies the scenario on .NET Framework (Windows) where MSAL supports WinForms-based UI.

Redirect the build output for all the projects to the top-level out/ directory. This means it's easier to do the path-math for signing and building the installers. Use Nerdbank.GitVersioning to provide a unified Semantic Version model for all of our assemblies and installers. Integrate the Mac-native MSAuth helper Xcode workspace into the main .NET build by chaining the build into the main CLI .NET project so that MSBuild shells out to xcodebuild. Also create a wrapper .NET project for the Mac installer script with a two step process: 'layout.sh' for making the installer payload layout, and 'pack.sh' for constructing the pkg file. Building the MSBuild project will call both layout and pack to produce an unsigned pkg file for development purposes. The signed release build can call 'layout.sh' and 'pack.sh' separately (and do signing of binaries in between)."

If there are concurrent processes that have called module but not yet module or module, there's a gap when another (faster) process could have completed the module combination and have stored a different credential value than what the first process got from module. If the first process fails and calls module the valid credential as module-ed by the second process would be deleted. This change helps prevent such a scenario (although there is still a small gap inside the GCM erase command itself between reading the OS's credential store and deleting from it - we could look at some system-wide lock around the credential store if this is deemed a problem later)."

1443,Add basic .pkg installer script,Add a simple flat-package installer with postinstall script to configure the user's system gitconfig.
1444,Add initial version of Mac MSAuth helper using ADAL 2.5.1,"Add the initial version of the Mac Microsoft Authentication Helper using ADAL 2.5.1 via CocoaPods. The pods are statically linked so only a single executable ""Microsoft.Authentication.Helper"" is required to be distributed with GCM. ADAL 2.5.1 was chosen because later ADAL versions include a bug where errors were being written to standard error: https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc/issues/1362"
1445,Merge pull request #16 from mjcheetham/windows-msauth-helper,Add Microsoft Authentication helper for Windows
1446,Enable multi-targeting to NetFX 4.6.1 on Windows,"Enable building the class libraries and head CLI project against .NET Framework 4.6.1 when compiling on Windows. This enables the Windows-only authentication helpers (which build against the Microsoft.Git.CredentialManager.dll library) to avoid pulling in the .NET Standard type-forwarding libraries, which not only allows us to deploy the helpers and the main GCM executable in to the same directory without conflicting type-fwd libraries, but also greatly reduces the number of assemblies required to ship on Windows."
1447,Add Microsoft Authentication helper for Windows,Add an authentication helper for AAD/MSA auth that runs on Windows. ADAL.NET is used to obtain an access token based on input fed over stdin by Git Credential Manager. The access token is returned back to GCM over stdout on success. Common application start-up code has been refactored into the module abstract class. This ensures consistent tracing and debug support using the GCM_TRACE & GCM_TRACE_SECRETS and GCM_DEBUG environment variables.

1449,Add GitHub host provider with basic TTY cred prompts,The required web calls and call flow/patterns are based on the original Git Credential Manager GitHub code. The support for GitHub authentication is by a basic TTY credential prompt (also supporting 2FA). In the future a credential helper which can show GUI to capture the user/pass/auth-code can be added in a similar manner to the Microsoft Authentication Helper.
1450,Merge pull request #18 from mjcheetham/reorganise-build,Enable building Mac/Windows specific solution projects
1451,Enable building Mac/Windows specific solution projects,"Rearrange the directory structure of the repository to make it easier to selectively build platform-specific code. The common/ directory contains any code that can be built and run on all platforms. The windows/ (and mac/, linux/, etc as needed) directory contains code that can only be built and/or run on Windows. Change the main .NET solution to be built for either Windows or Mac - building only those projects which are required for Windows/Mac. This is done via solution configurations, of which there are now four:  Debug Release WindowsDebug WindowsRelease  The Windows* configurations will build all the common class libraries (netstandard2.0), the Windows helpers (net461) and the CLI head project (netcoreapp2.1). The Debug/Release configurations will build only the common libraries (netstandard2.0) and the CLI head project (netcoreapp2.1). This is suitable for building on Mac & Linux (and Windows without the helpers)."

1453,Ensure all app resources are disposed on exit,Refactor the main module class to be disposed on application exit. All components that have module object references have now been given a chance to dispose of them.
1454,Update Azure Repos REST API class to reuse it's HttpClients,"Update the Azure Repos REST API class to only create one module instance, configure common headers, and reuse the same instance for all requests."
1455,Revert back to new HttpClient instance per request,"Move back to creating a new HttpClient instance per request for few reasons:  The current code/pattern was broken - we were double disposing of    the singleton client instance. It makes setting headers slightly easier as the caller no longer    must create request message with the headers set manually - just    set the default headers on their exclusive client.  In practice we're not going to be running for a long time, and we're not going to be making many requests, which would otherwise drain all the available network ports. If the individual providers wish to obtain a new HttpClient instance and reuse it for all their web calls, they are free to do so."

1459,Add Azure Repos host provider,Add a host provider for the Azure Repos Git host provider. Authentication with AAD or MSA is performed by calling out to a platform-specific 'helper' application which can show native GUI. These AAD/MSA auth platform helpers will be added at a later date.
1460,Update module to use singleton client,"Don't create a new module on each module call; we run the risk of exhausting all available sockets because a socket is assigned per client instance, and the socket does not become free immediately after disposal of the client. In light of this change to use a singleton instance, don't set the default headers on that singleton client otherwise we will pollute the client setup for other callers. Instead we set the headers per request message that is sent. Tests have been updated to cover the above changes. Additional minor change: move the HTTP-y constants to a nested static class module for better grouping."

1479,Use the global alloc/free methods for native interop,Replace usages of the COM allocator (module and module) in the credential stores code with the global allocator (module and module). Since there is no COM heap on Mac using this allocator was not the correct thing to do. On Windows the CredRead/Write/Delete calls are Win32 API calls which don't use COM either. Use the global allocator for WindowsCredMgr native code
