7,xui: add a dispatcher class,0.46218616,Ensure we init IEnvironment before SessionManager (#1167),"We are spending about 45ms on macOS to read version information by shelling out to sw_vers on each run of GCM. Let's try and be smarter and use BCL APIs, system APIs or file-based sources for the OS and distribution information before resorting to external processes.

29,Avoid creating external processes to read OS version info (#1240),0.5421679,Ensure we create a WindowsProcessManager on Windows (#1146),"With the plan to migrate GCM to a formula for release via Homebrew/homebrew-core, it became clear that Nerdbank.GitVersioning was no longer an option for versioning the project. This is because Nerdbank.GitVersioning requires history to calculate things like 'Git height', and the formula requires a tarball to build, which, of course, has no history. This change pivots GCM to the simpler strategy of using a version specified in a VERSION file at root. This version will be updated by maintainers prior to release - giving them more granular control of versioning, which in turn allows for versioning to be more predictable (i.e. maintainers will know what the version will be before publication of the release). The version specified in the file is the one slated for the next release: 2.1.0.0. Note: This change fails on Windows due to a bug in MSAL unless we ensure all projects have at least 1 dependency. We are working around this issue by adding Newtonsoft.Json as this dependency (since we were already shipping it anyway).",0

Versioning in this file will begin with the version we plan to use for the next release: 2.1.0.0. This change involves the addition of a new custom MSBuild task, which reads in the contents of the VERSION file, converts it to a Version object, and then sets the various version-related MSBuild properties with the correct value (some with the Revision component appended, others without).

43,Merge pull request #336 from mjcheetham/xui2,0.42291957,"Fix winget publishing (#332, #338)","Today GCM has an architecture that delegates all GUI prompting to (bundled) external executables, using WPF-based helpers on Windows and Avalonia UI helpers on Mac and Linux. Each host provider has its own GUI helper executable, meaning we currently bundle four (GitHub.UI, GitLab.UI, Atlassian.Bitbucket.UI, git-credential-manager.ui [for generic auth]) helpers in addition to the core git-credential-manager CLI executable. On Linux we use the ""publish as a single-file"" model for each of these executables, meaning we have a copy of the CLR included for each executable! That means five CLRs! Now that the Avalonia UI-based GUI helpers have matured, we can look at dropping the WPF helpers and reduce the effort required to ship new GUI by 50% (we no longer need to do everything twice: once with WPF and once with Avalonia UI). In addition, in a recent spike, I found that it may be possible to bring the Avalonia UI helpers in-process, with nearly zero net-new code. This would help reduce our installation footprint on Linux down to approximately 1/4 of the current size. The single executable model would also help decrease build times, and increase end-user performance since we no longer pay the process startup costs using external processes! We need to be mindful that this change may result in a small increase in the Windows installation as we now bring in extra libraries used to support Avalonia UI, whereas previously we relied on WPF libraries as included with Windows 'for free'. This is expected to be minimal. As for the current GUI extensibility model, we are not aware of any consumers, but it would not be much effort to keep the existing external process model, but now just default to using our in-process GUI options in the absence of external configuration. This still gives tools like VS or VSCode options to integrate native UI for GCM in the future. Initially, we are still keeping the WPF helpers around on Windows but disabled by default. We can drop these after at least one release using the in-proc Avalonia helpers. To switch back to the WPF helpers, use credential.devUseLegacyUIHelpers or GCM_DEV_USELEGACYUIHELPERS.",0

In preparation for this, we need to do some re-organization of the Trace2 code. With this change we:  Move TRACE2 tracing startup into Program.cs for GCM and the helper exes. This allows us to start tracing earlier and capture more events. Add an Initialize() method to Trace2.cs to detect whether Trace2 tracing is enabled and set long-lived variables. This also sets a new _initialized property that allows us to determine whether Trace2 tracing has been initialized. Trace2 tracing is disabled until _initialized is set to true by the Initialize() method. Change the name of TryParseSettings() to InitializeWriters() for improved clarity.

This is useful in situations where the output is verbose and should be suppressed rather than output to the console, for example. However, this can cause an issue with TRACE2 deadlocks, as Git writes to standard error and GCM does nothing. This change corrects this by not redirecting standard error for Git-related processes (which also extends to places such as Environment.cs, given Git's reliance on envars). Finally, there are some places where we should still redirect standard error for the reason mentioned above.

265,Use the global alloc/free methods for native interop,0.4908927,Generic OAuth support via config 🎉 #1062,"When we introduced the rename warning in #551, there was broken logic for resolving the actual invoked program name on Mac and Linux. Windows We continue to use CommandLineToArgvW(GetCommandLine(), ..) to return the absolute, full path to the entry executable. macOS Switch from _NSGetArgv() to _NSGetExecutablePath(..) which, like the Windows APIs above, returns the full path to the entry executable (or symlink). Linux As there is no equivalent to CommandLineToArgvW or _NSGetExecutablePath here, we instead do some path computation based on the form of argv[0] that we get from /proc/self/cmdline. - If the value is an absolute path, just use that. - If the value is relative to the current directory (./name) then combine this with the current directory. - If the value contains a directory separator (dir/name) then also resolve this from the current directory. - Otherwise, this argv[0] value must have been a file name (name) resolved from the $PATH. If we still don't manage to resolve from the $PATH, try and resolve the symlink /proc/self/exe that points to the executable image that was loaded from disk. Note that we may miss any intermediate link names here, but it's better than nothing.  In addition, we also never tested the .NET Tool scenario after updating the ICommandContext.ApplicationPath to use the entry executable name, whereas previously this was computed from the .NET assembly path. Introduce a separate concept, the InstallationDirectory that always points to the home of the core assemblies. This is used for resolving things like in-box UI helpers.",0

267,msauth: add support for Windows broker (WAM),0.8566131,Add workaround for Windows Broker (WAM) running as admin (#344),"Our previous implementation of getting the native argv[0] was flawed on Linux and Mac.

Additionally, the logic of appending the CWD to the argv[0] value when the latter wasn't rooted was also just wrong! Update to now use _NSExecutablePath on macOS, which always returns the full absolute path, and add correct handling of unrooted argv[0] on Linux. Furthermore, on Linux, if we are unable to handle the value from /proc/self/cmdline, we fall back to resolving the /proc/self/exe symlink instead.",1

Additionally, actually now store the non-default port number in the target URI if there is one given. We also now always trim any trailing '/' from the end of the path of a service/target URI. Previously we erronously only trimmed the '/' from a 'pathless' URI, i.e.: https://example.com/      => https://example.com   https://example.com/path/ => https://example.com/path/ This is a safe change since the Enumerate method that is used by both Get and Remove already matches both trailing and non-trailing slashes by virtue of creating and comparing components of a System.Uri which does normalisation of the path.

This meant the check would be run for Bitbucket Cloud and DC regardless. It would fail for Bitbucket DC The fix is more radical than simply re-instating the check on the type of Bitbucket host.

682,bb-test: inline 2FA mocking test helpers,0.51470006,Reduce warnings from tests (#337),"libcurl supports multiple different environment variables [1] to configure proxy behaviour: http_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy, and no_proxy. Unlike most other environment variables these proxy envars are normally lowercase, not uppercase. This convention was set by libwww back in the early 1990s. When libcurl was first released however, it was not aware of this schism and only implemented checks for uppercase variants of these envars: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. In time, libcurl learned to also read the lowercase variants, and gives them precedence over the uppercase forms (since the former are quasi- standards). However, to further complicate the matter, libcurl no longer reads the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable specifically. This change was made to address a security concern with some CGI webservers [2]. The problem is that today GCM only reads the uppercase variants of the environment variables! This is inconsistent with libcurl, and therefore Git's behaviour (that we aim to be consistent/co-operative with). We change GCM's behaviour to match that of libcurl/Git in that the lowercase proxy envars are preferred to the uppercase ones, and the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable is ignored. Dropping support for the HTTP_PROXY uppercase envar is technically a breaking change, but if the user had only set this uppercase envar then Git would not be proxying the actual remote calls, only GCM, which is most likely not what the user wanted.

685,basic: rename ByUi method to ViaHelper,0.41125026,org-rename: update references to GitCredentialManager (#1141),"We aim to be compatible with the behaviour of Git as much as possible when it comes to network settings. This enables users to setup Git proxy settings and get the same setup ""for free"" with GCM. Git uses libcurl to provide it's HTTP interactions. The NO_PROXY setting is used by libcurl to disable proxy settings for specific hosts. We previously attempted to plumb the value of NO_PROXY through to the .NET WebProxy class' list of ""bypassed addresses"" (the set of hosts that should not be proxied). However, the .NET class expects a set of regular expressions which is unlike libcurl! As a result, libcurl permitted values for NO_PROXY were throwing errors inside of GCM since they are not valid regexs. In this commit we perform a transformation of the NO_PROXY list and construct a set of regular expressions that match addresses in the same way as libcurl does. The transformation is as follows:  strip any leading periods '.' or wildcards '*.' escape the remaining input to match literally (e.g.: '.' becomes '.') prepend a group that matches either a period '.' or a URI scheme    delimiter '://' - this prevents partial domain matching append a end-of-string symbol '$' to ensure we only match to the    specified TLD and port  See the libcurl documentation on NO_PROXY behaviour: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOPROXY.html",0

This dispatcher is different from the built-in Avalonia Dispatcher type. On macOS the underlying platform requires that the main NSRunLoop be run on the entry thread of the process (that is, thread 0). This is unlike on Windows where all that is required is an ""STA"" thread. Because of this we need to ""reserve"" thread 0 (the main entry thread) for running the Avalonia infrastructure, and kick off a new thread to run the rest of the ""normal"" .NET application logic (such as command-line handling). The dispatcher allows queuing of work to be run on the initialised thread, until the loop is terminated. We can use this dispatcher and model to start the Avalonia app/runloops at a defered time, after main app startup. The Avalonia Dispatcher type is then used to push more work on to that inner message pump/runloop after the Avalonia application has started.",0

We only allow binding at the organisation level (and not any other level) as this is the most common scenario: one user for an entire Azure DevOps organisation. If the user wishes to override the chosen user for a particular clone they can do so by binding the user to the local repository configuration, rather than the default global configuration.

Since .NET 5, published single-file apps no longer use the self- extraction model, and are real single file with all assemblies and native libraries statically linked/bundled. We now use the Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() method to get the raw underlying ""argv"" arguments, which argv[0] is the absolute file path to the entry executable.

With the introduction of the dev.azure.com-style URLs for Azure Repos there was an unfortunate hack or workaround invented to add the AzDevOps org name to the userinfo part of the remote URL, for example: org@dev.azure.com/org/blah. Since GCM for Windows (and older versions of GCM Core that initially followed the same model) always uses the value ""PersonalAccessToken"" for the username field when storing credentials it was free to ignore the user part of the input. The problem now is that since we support multiple user accounts, and will perform an exact match against the credential (with user) if a username is specified in the remote URL, we never find the credential we now store (we now always store with the actual, real users' UPN). To workaround this workaround (yuck) we ignore the username IF AND ONLY IF the host is dev.azure.com, and return the first matching dev.azure.com/org credential. The upshot of this is that dev.azure.com-style URLs do NOT support multiple users OR full paths, however vs.com-style URLs will.",1

When no user name and/or password are given on standard input we skip checking the stored value and just erase the credential. This is an important but possibly subtle behaviour to help prevent erroneous erasure of credentials. Calls to git-credential fill should immediately be followed by git-credential approve or reject. If there are concurrent processes that have called fill but not yet approve or reject, there's a gap when another (faster) process could have completed the fill+approve combination and have stored a different credential value than what the first process got from fill. If the first process fails and calls reject the valid credential as approve-ed by the second process would be deleted. This change helps prevent such a scenario (although there is still a small gap inside the GCM erase command itself between reading the OS's credential store and deleting from it - we could look at some system-wide lock around the credential store if this is deemed a problem later).",0
