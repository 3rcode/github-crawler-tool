1,Merge pull request #73 from mjcheetham/configservice,0.4316694,Fix a bug with host provider disposal (#272),"Use the new Windows broker which is based on the MSALRuntime; an export wrapper around a native, cross-platform MSAL library. In this new set up, we drop the .Desktop package in favour of the .Broker package that also means we drop the WebView2Loader.dll, which we didn't make use of anyway. There are a few new binaries to be distributed in the new model, including a P/Invoke layer, IdentityModel abstractions library, and the native msalruntime_x86.dll. Note that GCM still only support x86 on Windows, and only supports broker use on Windows. For this reason we don't bother adding the broker package on non-.NET Framework builds to keep the sizes on Mac/Linux to a minimum. Also update the MSAL extensions library whilst we are here to pick up various bug fixes, and drop workarounds that are no longer required for this new broker implementation!",0

Previously we only set this if provided a handle by the user/config. Now however we must always try and provide a handle because using the new MSALRuntime-based Windows broker means we must do so - MSAL no longer provides us with a 'dummy' handle to use.

24,Removing hard-coded values,0.4419102,Drop -core suffix from entry executable #551 ,"Add TRACE2 region tracing capability. The first six commits contain minor refactors, bug fixes, and cleanups. The first moves Trace2 messages into their own file. The second removes the unnecessary AddDots() method. The third fixes certain conflated timing information in child_start and child_exit events. The fourth ensures we're writing exit message times in UTC. The fifth adds descriptive comments to Trace2-related classes that did not yet have them. The sixth adds best-effort logic to capture thread names. The next three commits are dedicated to preparing for and adding region-related logic. The seventh commit updates custom performance format span handling to account for the repo and category fields, which are used in region tracing. The eighth adds region-related events, encapsulated in a class that inherits from DisposableObject (which in turn inherits from IDisposable). The ninth adds region tracing to methods of interest pertaining to OAuth authentication. The final commit updates GCM's documentation to inform users of how to enable and utilize Trace2 tracing.

26,macOS release: sign and notarize package,0.6387076,Notarize the macOS installer and binaries to permit running on macOS Catalina 10.15 (#84),Add region tracing to key methods in OAuth2Client. This was deemed a good starting point for regions due to the server interaction required to obtain tokens.

This includes the normal Write methods in Trace2 and corresponding Trace2 messages with a few notable distinctions:  There is an abstract parent RegionMessage that inherits from Trace2Message. The RegionEnterMessage and RegionLeave messages inherit from this parent (rather than Trace2Message) to maximize reuse of shared fields. We create a new Region class that implements DisposableObject and call it using a CreateRegion method in Trace2. This ensures that we call WriteRegionLeave before a Region object is disposed - a key requirement of Git's Trace2 API for regions.  Additionally, it allows us to manage getting the executing thread name and region timings within the class, thus removing this burden from consumers.  An additional note is that the region_enter and region_leave events will always have the same line number with this model. This was deemed to be acceptable, however, given that knowing where a region begins executing provides enough information for inspection of the region if it is needed.",0

Note that this is a best effort - there are certain places (most notably certain static and unsafe methods) where statements were purposefully not added because it is either not safe or was deemed to much lift/churn to do so. Note that there are some instances in which a ""parameterized"" message is passed to TRACE2. This is used only when PII information could be passed into the message (e.g. through a path or remote URI) and should be redacted for collection purposes. Finally, there are certain instances in which we write an error with no exception thrown.

49,FAQ minor writing fix,0.62633055,Documentation fixes (#333),"This series adds the performance format target for TRACE2 tracing. The first two patches are small fixes for bugs I noticed as I was testing the performance format target. The first moves the FormatTargetTypes enum from the specific Trace2StreamWriter class to the shared Trace2Writer class. The second ensures the normal format event names are written in snake case (rather than lowercase). The third patch adds the ability to get the ""depth"" of the process. Because Sids and depth are process-related concepts, it removes the SidManager class and moved depth/sid-related properties and methods into the ProcessManager class. The fourth patch adds the performance format target. It includes a few notable components:  A new GetMessage method to ensure message strings written to normal and performance targets are not duplicated. A new PerformanceFormatComponent class to track sizing of optional properties of performance format messages. A BuildSpan method that Trace2Message children use to create correctly-sized ""spans"" for optional properties of performance format messages. A span is a piece of the message beginning with a pipe (|) and ending just before the next pipe or the end of the message. A BuildTimeSpan method that adjusts spans for long/short times.

When inside of a WSL session, without WSLg enabled, it is still possible to launch a web browser in the hosting Windows session. Split the determination between ""GUI session"" and ""browser possible"", and add the special case for WSL inside an interactive Windows session. Things are complicated here because it is possible to SSH in to the WSL instance from outside of the Windows host, meaning the Windows session also doesn't have UI.

Strictly speaking, except for session 0 (from Vista onwards), any Windows session can have exactly one interactive window station (always called WinSta0). However, because we cannot easily determine the window station name from a simple cmd/powershell script, we take a simplified approach which isn't 100% accurate. Instead, we only permit browser auth methods if we are NOT in Windows session 0; any other Windows session we assume we are in WinSta0. The default OpenSSH Server configuration (Windows 10+) has sshd running as the built-in NT user NETWORK_SERVICE, which means it runs in session 0 (the services session).

71,github: fix bug in 2FA UI helper invocation,0.6510459,Fix bug in GitHub x-platform UI where the browser/OAuth option is not shown (#360),"This change adds the child_start and child_exit events to GCM's TRACE2 tracing system. The first patches are either bug fixes or prep for the bigger refactors involved in making child start and exit work. The first patch puts sid-related logic into its own class, which allows us to immediately set up GCM's sid in Program.cs to ensure Git processes that are executed before TRACE2 tracing is set up have the correct parent sid. The next patch adds a FileWriter class and uses it (rather than Trace2StreamWriter) to write to files, which ensures processes aren't overwriting one another's data. The third patch adds a snake casing string extension to ensure we write multi-word enum values according to the TRACE2 convention. The fourth patch ensures we do not redirect stderr for Git-related processes, as it was discovered to cause deadlocks when TRACE2 was enabled. The fifth patch refactors GCM's diagnostics to depend on an instance of CommandContext rather than individual dependencies within CommandContext. The sixth patch re-configures TRACE2 to depend on an instance of CommandContext rather than individual dependencies within CommandContext, to start up earlier, and for operations to no-op if Trace2 has not yet been initialized (i.e. when child git config processes run before we're able to set up tracing). The seventh patch wraps Process.cs to give us the needed level of control to write TRACE2 child process start and exit events. The eighth patch (finally) adds the new child start and exit events.",0

In preparation for this, we need to do some re-organization of the Trace2 code. With this change we:  Move TRACE2 tracing startup into Program.cs for GCM and the helper exes. This allows us to start tracing earlier and capture more events. Add an Initialize() method to Trace2.cs to detect whether Trace2 tracing is enabled and set long-lived variables. This also sets a new _initialized property that allows us to determine whether Trace2 tracing has been initialized. Trace2 tracing is disabled until _initialized is set to true by the Initialize() method. Change the name of TryParseSettings() to InitializeWriters() for improved clarity.

This is useful in situations where the output is verbose and should be suppressed rather than output to the console, for example. However, this can cause an issue with TRACE2 deadlocks, as Git writes to standard error and GCM does nothing. This change corrects this by not redirecting standard error for Git-related processes (which also extends to places such as Environment.cs, given Git's reliance on envars). Finally, there are some places where we should still redirect standard error for the reason mentioned above.

173,.NET tool: split packaging script,0.48049426,Move to .NET Framework 4.7.2 on Windows (#283),"When we introduced the rename warning in #551, there was broken logic for resolving the actual invoked program name on Mac and Linux. Windows We continue to use CommandLineToArgvW(GetCommandLine(), ..) to return the absolute, full path to the entry executable. macOS Switch from _NSGetArgv() to _NSGetExecutablePath(..) which, like the Windows APIs above, returns the full path to the entry executable (or symlink). Linux As there is no equivalent to CommandLineToArgvW or _NSGetExecutablePath here, we instead do some path computation based on the form of argv[0] that we get from /proc/self/cmdline. - If the value is an absolute path, just use that. - If the value is relative to the current directory (./name) then combine this with the current directory. - If the value contains a directory separator (dir/name) then also resolve this from the current directory. - Otherwise, this argv[0] value must have been a file name (name) resolved from the $PATH. If we still don't manage to resolve from the $PATH, try and resolve the symlink /proc/self/exe that points to the executable image that was loaded from disk. Note that we may miss any intermediate link names here, but it's better than nothing.  In addition, we also never tested the .NET Tool scenario after updating the ICommandContext.ApplicationPath to use the entry executable name, whereas previously this was computed from the .NET assembly path. Introduce a separate concept, the InstallationDirectory that always points to the home of the core assemblies. This is used for resolving things like in-box UI helpers.",0

175,msauth: rename resource to scopes and drop remote URI,0.4882608,Added support for local network host URIs (#699),"Our previous implementation of getting the native argv[0] was flawed on Linux and Mac. The Mac _NSArgv and Linux /proc/self/cmdline function/proc-file return the raw argv[0] which may not be an absolute or rooted path, but we expected this to be the same. Additionally, the logic of appending the CWD to the argv[0] value when the latter wasn't rooted was also just wrong! Update to now use _NSExecutablePath on macOS, which always returns the full absolute path, and add correct handling of unrooted argv[0] on Linux. Furthermore, on Linux, if we are unable to handle the value from /proc/self/cmdline, we fall back to resolving the /proc/self/exe symlink instead.",0

Additionally, actually now store the non-default port number in the target URI if there is one given. We also now always trim any trailing '/' from the end of the path of a service/target URI. Previously we erronously only trimmed the '/' from a 'pathless' URI, i.e.: https://example.com/      => https://example.com   https://example.com/path/ => https://example.com/path/ This is a safe change since the Enumerate method that is used by both Get and Remove already matches both trailing and non-trailing slashes by virtue of creating and comparing components of a System.Uri which does normalisation of the path. Both Get and Remove would act (eventually) to remove any bad credentials stored with a trailing slash, even if new credentials are only written out without the slash.",0

Prior to this only authentication requests for Bitbucket Cloud would try and automatically determine if 2FA was required by the current user by calling a Bitbucket Cloud REST API using user provided Basic Auth credentials Commit: 5a2cfd7 removed checking of the current host was Bitbucket Cloud vs DC. This meant the check would be run for Bitbucket Cloud and DC regardless. It would fail for Bitbucket DC The fix is more radical than simply re-instating the check on the type of Bitbucket host. From 1st March 2022 support for using a Bitbucket Cloud user's account password to access REST or Git HTTPS operations has been removed, https://atlassian.community/t5/x/x/ba-p/1948231. As such this automatic test to see if 2FA is required no longer works. Therefore the check against the Bitbucket Cloud REST API has been removed in its entirety",1

581,release: publish draft release to GitHub,0.65255773,Initial release of Git Credential Manager Core with beta support for...,"libcurl supports multiple different environment variables [1] to configure proxy behaviour: http_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy, and no_proxy. Unlike most other environment variables these proxy envars are normally lowercase, not uppercase. This convention was set by libwww back in the early 1990s. When libcurl was first released however, it was not aware of this schism and only implemented checks for uppercase variants of these envars: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. In time, libcurl learned to also read the lowercase variants, and gives them precedence over the uppercase forms (since the former are quasi- standards). However, to further complicate the matter, libcurl no longer reads the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable specifically. This change was made to address a security concern with some CGI webservers [2]. The problem is that today GCM only reads the uppercase variants of the environment variables! This is inconsistent with libcurl, and therefore Git's behaviour (that we aim to be consistent/co-operative with). We change GCM's behaviour to match that of libcurl/Git in that the lowercase proxy envars are preferred to the uppercase ones, and the uppercase HTTP_PROXY variable is ignored. Dropping support for the HTTP_PROXY uppercase envar is technically a breaking change, but if the user had only set this uppercase envar then Git would not be proxying the actual remote calls, only GCM, which is most likely not what the user wanted.

This enables users to setup Git proxy settings and get the same setup ""for free"" with GCM. Git uses libcurl to provide it's HTTP interactions. The NO_PROXY setting is used by libcurl to disable proxy settings for specific hosts. We previously attempted to plumb the value of NO_PROXY through to the .NET WebProxy class' list of ""bypassed addresses"" (the set of hosts that should not be proxied). However, the .NET class expects a set of regular expressions which is unlike libcurl! As a result, libcurl permitted values for NO_PROXY were throwing errors inside of GCM since they are not valid regexs. In this commit we perform a transformation of the NO_PROXY list and construct a set of regular expressions that match addresses in the same way as libcurl does. The transformation is as follows:  strip any leading periods '.' or wildcards '*.' escape the remaining input to match literally (e.g.: '.' becomes '.') prepend a group that matches either a period '.' or a URI scheme    delimiter '://' - this prevents partial domain matching append a end-of-string symbol '$' to ensure we only match to the    specified TLD and port  See the libcurl documentation on NO_PROXY behaviour: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOPROXY.html",0

This dispatcher is different from the built-in Avalonia Dispatcher type. On macOS the underlying platform requires that the main NSRunLoop be run on the entry thread of the process (that is, thread 0). This is unlike on Windows where all that is required is an ""STA"" thread. Because of this we need to ""reserve"" thread 0 (the main entry thread) for running the Avalonia infrastructure, and kick off a new thread to run the rest of the ""normal"" .NET application logic (such as command-line handling). The dispatcher allows queuing of work to be run on the initialised thread, until the loop is terminated. We can use this dispatcher and model to start the Avalonia app/runloops at a defered time, after main app startup. The Avalonia Dispatcher type is then used to push more work on to that inner message pump/runloop after the Avalonia application has started.",0

The workaround is to set the process COM security to ""none"" iif we are on Windows 10, the process is elevated, and the user hasn't disabled the broker. It is possible the call to CoInitializeSecurity may fail, as this can only be called once in the lifetime of a process, and must be called before any COM interactions occur.

Since GCM for Windows (and older versions of GCM Core that initially followed the same model) always uses the value ""PersonalAccessToken"" for the username field when storing credentials it was free to ignore the user part of the input. The problem now is that since we support multiple user accounts, and will perform an exact match against the credential (with user) if a username is specified in the remote URL, we never find the credential we now store (we now always store with the actual, real users' UPN). To workaround this workaround (yuck) we ignore the username IF AND ONLY IF the host is dev.azure.com, and return the first matching dev.azure.com/org credential.

Redirect the build output for all the projects to the top-level out/ directory. This means it's easier to do the path-math for signing and building the installers. Use Nerdbank.GitVersioning to provide a unified Semantic Version model for all of our assemblies and installers. Integrate the Mac-native MSAuth helper Xcode workspace into the main .NET build by chaining the build into the main CLI .NET project so that MSBuild shells out to xcodebuild. Also create a wrapper .NET project for the Mac installer script with a two step process: 'layout.sh' for making the installer payload layout, and 'pack.sh' for constructing the pkg file. Building the MSBuild project will call both layout and pack to produce an unsigned pkg file for development purposes. The signed release build can call 'layout.sh' and 'pack.sh' separately (and do signing of binaries in between).",0

When no user name and/or password are given on standard input we skip checking the stored value and just erase the credential. This is an important but possibly subtle behaviour to help prevent erroneous erasure of credentials. Calls to git-credential fill should immediately be followed by git-credential approve or reject. If there are concurrent processes that have called fill but not yet approve or reject, there's a gap when another (faster) process could have completed the fill+approve combination and have stored a different credential value than what the first process got from fill. If the first process fails and calls reject the valid credential as approve-ed by the second process would be deleted. This change helps prevent such a scenario (although there is still a small gap inside the GCM erase command itself between reading the OS's credential store and deleting from it - we could look at some system-wide lock around the credential store if this is deemed a problem later).",0
