Addressable::URI.encode (from addressable 2.4.0 and later) thought it was a URI and raised an error. I should have been using cgi_escape, which is for strings that will be added to URIs and not uri_escape, which is for encoding strings that are already in a URI. This commit borrows from the addressable docs to make it more specific so that readers choose uri_escape when they already have a URI and cgi_escape when they are just escaping a plain string.",1

This topic is primarily intended for users who have a lot of pages on their site (such as for documentation websites), and want to build a more robust sidebar navigation. Jekyll combines Liquid with YAML in interesting ways that aren't really documented clearly in the existing docs, except for a brief reference here. You can read about Liquid on Shopify and YAML in YAML's docs, but exactly how you store YAML files in a Jekyll project and iterate through them using Liquid loops and filters to generate lists of pages is something that isn't clear to a lot of people. (You can see origins of these questions in previous help issues.)  The documentation on navigation would fit well into the Jekyll docs.",0

In my environment, they are listed alphabetically. On my Mac, when asking for a list of files in a directory, those files are returned as a nicely sorted list. Alphabetized, like you'd want them to be. Like you'd expect them to be. In some environments, quite different from my own, the return of a similar operation is quite random. Perhaps q comes before a, or e before d; the filesystem will choose its order of the day and you, the fare user, tired and weary from work, must bare the brunt of this. And so, with this commit, I do hereby request that the noble makers of Dir[] provide for us, the downtrodden and ravaged users, some consistency. As a user of Ruby, I shouldn't have to know or consider the behaviour of an individual filesystem here; it should function the same for all filesystems. Truly yours, Parker",1

This is desirable both from a correctness standpoint, that the excerpt should not introduce any new content, and more practically to allow fast and easy detection of whole-post excerpts in Liquid templates using post.excerpt == post.content.  A common use-case is deciding whether to render ""Read More"" links on a page containing post excerpts. This commit does exactly that.  It avoids adding additional newlines to the excerpt content when the excerpt includes the whole post and adds tests to ensure that this behavior is correct and preserved going forward.

5700,Merge pull request #3532 from willnorris/ordinal_docs,0.53692317,Docs: Fix permalink example (#6375),"A week ago, I asked @parkr via email if he could add my site here (mostly because I thought it's too cheeky to just propose a file-change). But now he told me that it's better to just do it here: I'm asking because I spend a huge amount of time and effort on making it great and usefully structured for people who're just getting started with Jekyll. Therefore it's also great as a forked starting-point, if you ask me. Besides keeping the code clean, I also spend much time on making the site as fast as possible. There's not much CSS in use, the HTML output is minified and images are directly served from the repo (and therefore GitHub's CDN) instead of from third-party services. There's also a lot of ""include""-thinking happening for things like embedded Tweets, images or iFrames - which most people just inline in each post. When making a significant change, I also always make sure to write a few paragraphs about why I exactly did it as a commit message. And when it comes to really big updates, I write entire posts too (explaining all improvements and their benefits to the site's performance/look). Here's an recent example: http://leo.github.io/notes/v2/ I'm definitely sure that many people could get something out of it. Don't you think so too?",0

More information at: http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/120415 redcarpet Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the parse_inline() function in markdown.c does not validate input before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server. https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/9fc00d0814807064e2dc7343fc330f7cdcf8112a https://github.com/fiedl/your_platform/commit/8e707ebb947dd4277704849bcc4a383401d4bd0e http://social.schiessle.org/display/b38b1460c2b201329b1f4860008dbc6c https://gemnasium.com/gems/redcarpet/versions/3.2.3 /cc @parkr @envygeeks,0

If the permalink setting contains a trailing slash, either explicitly or by being set to ':pretty', then pages and collections permalinks will contain trailing slashes by default as well.  Similarly, if the permalink setting contains a trailing ':output_ext', so will pages and collections.  If the permalink setting contains neither a trailing slash or extension, neither will pages or collections. This impacts only the default permalink structure for pages and collections.

This allows for URLs that contain no extension or trailing slash to still result in proper destination files with .html extensions. Because this change relies so heavily on output_ext accurately identifying the extension of the destination file, this change also removes the feature test that tested support for permalinks with a .htm extension.  In order to support alternate file extensions, a future patch or plugin will need to modify the output_ext value, at which point everything else should work as expected.",0

Conversion error: There was an error converting 'contribute.markdown'. /Users/nick/Documents/puppet-docs/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.8/gems/kramdown-1.0.2/lib/kramdown/converter/html.rb:404:in obfuscate': undefined methodencoding' for ""mailto"":String (NoMethodError) See also: http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=29750&group_id=7403&atid=28673 This problem traced back to the following line in the Kramdown source: result.force_encoding(text.encoding) if result.respond_to?(:force_encoding) Strings aren't supposed to respond to the :force_encoding method in Ruby < 1.9, but lib/jekyll/core_ext.rb was modifying the string class like so: def force_encoding(enc)   self end Strings still won't respond to :encoding, though, so we get an error when Kramdown tries to read the incoming encoding and everything will blow up. An ack of the codebase suggests that this was only added so we could force an encoding for rdiscount on 1.9 without having to check whether we were running under 1.8. Since testing for said method to learn whether one is running under a 1.9-like encoding regime seems to be a thing in libraries we rely on, we shouldn't insert this dummy method without also dummying every other part of the Ruby 1.9+ encoding system. This commit removes the dummy :force_encoding method to stop poisoning core classes for libraries we use, and moves the adjustment for 1.9-like encoding regimes to the one place where it's needed.",0

9829,Add Jekyll::Configuration,0.7923087,Enhance option's case for Jekyll configuration (#8992),"As a new user to jekyll I wanted to get up and running as quickly as possible. The first thing I did was jump to the docs (missing the example on the homepage - my bad) and look for the quick start guide. Since I couldn't find one I went for the 'Basic Usage' section. I ended up muddling around for about 10 minutes until I hit the home page again to see the simple - and very easy - example of how to get started. So, in this pull request I've moved the Quick-start Guide out to it's own section so that users who really are impatient (like me) can clearly look for and jump to the quick start guide, follow the super-easy steps, and be up and running in a matter of minutes. Interested to hear if this is thought of as being a good idea.",1

10845,move regex to the top,0.59609926,Remove duplicate regexp phrase: ^\A (#3089),"Currently, Classifier::LSI rebuilds the index every time an entry is added.  This runs into massive performance overheads on my website; theoretically, disabling automatic index rebuilds, and explicitly rebuilding the LSI index at the end of the LSI repopulation should speed things up nicely. As a side note, here, I use pandoc-ruby to provide a more featureful Markdown transformer, so be mindful that the numbers I quote here have artifically imposed I/O overheads. With just the 76 posts I wrote this year (abysmal, I know), I come up with the following figures: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  16.91s user 0.88s system 97% cpu 18.302 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  2.72s user 0.77s system 88% cpu 3.940 total  With 109 posts, we begin to see even better improvements: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  51.00s user 1.47s system 98% cpu 53.060 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  5.04s user 1.12s system 91% cpu 6.735 total  At this point, we begin to see I/O overheads being slower than LSI when faster_lsi is active.  I call that fairly conclusive.  But wait, there's more.  I have 273 posts lying around... I wonder what happens if I feed them all in.  With faster_lsi, it was nice and clippy. Without it, I simply gave up, and went and refilled my cup of tea. And it was still going. Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  1277.86s user 10.90s system 99% cpu 21:30.29 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  34.62s user 4.43s system 96% cpu 40.430 total  That is, in anyone's books, a major improvement.  Note, however, that I don't know just how well this will perform with jekyll --auto because I don't know how it does the LSI rebuilds.  I think (but please, don't commit me on this) that the LSI is rebuilt every time Jekyll picks up a file change. So, all up, the performance improvement is massive, and scales depending on how many files you have.  At the last point, the improvement is just on 3200%. A more optimal solution would be to cache the LSI index and/or content data somehow.  I'll leave that to when faster_lsi takes over ten minutes to run.",0
