Update Jekyll on Windows documentation [skip ci],0.73673105,"To our Windows users: while we don’t officially support Windows, we don’t wish to impede your normal use of Jekyll at all. Our lack of full support for Windows is due to our lack of a Windows machine for development testing (no one on the core team has a Windows machine upon which to test new release candidates), not due to any malice or willful oversight. If you come to us with an issue, we are more than happy to work through it with you to come to a solution that works for all platforms. Along those lines, we have created a Windows Test Force (WTF) which is a group of Jekyll users dedicated to making sure all future releases work on Windows before they’re released so we don’t have this issue again. A special thanks goes out to the initial WTF team members, XhmikosR, Julian Thilo, Pedro Rogério, and Alfred Xing.",,1

This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/jekyll❤️ It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. more info. See how it looks on this repo. You can also add a postinstall script to let people know after npm|yarn install that you are welcoming donations (optional). More info You can also add a ""Donate"" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing ""required"" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

You are awesome! 🙌 And welcome to the open collective community! 😊 Come chat with us in the #opensource channel on https://slack.opencollective.com - great place to ask questions and share best practices with other open source sustainers!",1

Makes uri_escape template docs more specific.,0.9643128,Makes uri_escape template docs more specific. (#5887),"I didn't know the difference between cgi_escape and uri_escape until it bit me when I had a colon in a title I used uri_escape on. Addressable::URI.encode (from addressable 2.4.0 and later) thought it was a URI and raised an error. I should have been using cgi_escape, which is for strings that will be added to URIs and not uri_escape, which is for encoding strings that are already in a URI. This commit borrows from the addressable docs to make it more specific so that readers choose uri_escape when they already have a URI and cgi_escape when they are just escaping a plain string.",1

This topic is primarily intended for users who have a lot of pages on their site (such as for documentation websites), and want to build a more robust sidebar navigation. Jekyll combines Liquid with YAML in interesting ways that aren't really documented clearly in the existing docs, except for a brief reference here. You can read about Liquid on Shopify and YAML in YAML's docs, but exactly how you store YAML files in a Jekyll project and iterate through them using Liquid loops and filters to generate lists of pages is something that isn't clear to a lot of people. (You can see origins of these questions in previous help issues.)  The documentation on navigation would fit well into the Jekyll docs.",0

In my environment, they are listed alphabetically. On my Mac, when asking for a list of files in a directory, those files are returned as a nicely sorted list. Alphabetized, like you'd want them to be. Like you'd expect them to be. In some environments, quite different from my own, the return of a similar operation is quite random. Perhaps q comes before a, or e before d; the filesystem will choose its order of the day and you, the fare user, tired and weary from work, must bare the brunt of this. And so, with this commit, I do hereby request that the noble makers of Dir[] provide for us, the downtrodden and ravaged users, some consistency. As a user of Ruby, I shouldn't have to know or consider the behaviour of an individual filesystem here; it should function the same for all filesystems. Truly yours, Parker",1

Additional repo needed for Fedora 23 Workspace,0.8454244,Additional package needed for Fedora 23 Workspace (#4685),"After running: sudo dnf install ruby ruby-devel rubygems nodejs sudo dnf group install ""C Development and Tools""  I was unable to install Jekyll via gem due to an error: The compiler failed to generate an executable file. (RuntimeError) You have to install development tools first.  Taken from the fedoraproject.org Gem page:  If you installed all the above, but the extensions would still not compile, you are probably running a Fedora image that misses redhat-rpm-config >package. In that case gcc compiler would complain about one of the following:  gcc: error: conftest.c: No such file or directory gcc: error: /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1: No such file or directory   To solve this, simply run sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config.  After doing so it downloaded, compiled and installed without a problem.",1

Per fedoraproject.org -- Gems this is necessary to install this. The instructions mirror what is listed on that page, but using yum instead of dnf - which is understandable because RH and CentOS still use yum.",0

Initial work on using Liquid::Drops instead of Hashes.,0.7731251,Use Liquid::Drops instead of Hashes in #to_liquid (#4277),"The properties of Liquid::Drops are only evaluated when they're asked for and therefore save computation time. This prevents a lot of GC time cleaning up objects that are not needed, because they're not created unless requested. Additionally, this saves time for actual computation of those values because they can be computed only if needed. It's funny how much it helps when you only do what is needed. Far less overhead.",1

Whole-post excerpts should match the post content,0.94697165,Whole-post excerpts should match the post content (#4004),"When a post does not contain an excerpt_separator, meaning the excerpt includes the entire post, the excerpt should contain exactly the post content. This is desirable both from a correctness standpoint, that the excerpt should not introduce any new content, and more practically to allow fast and easy detection of whole-post excerpts in Liquid templates using post.excerpt == post.content.  A common use-case is deciding whether to render ""Read More"" links on a page containing post excerpts. This commit does exactly that.  It avoids adding additional newlines to the excerpt content when the excerpt includes the whole post and adds tests to ensure that this behavior is correct and preserved going forward.

Added my site for learning purposes,0.7741899,Add a new site for learning purposes (#3917),"A week ago, I asked @parkr via email if he could add my site here (mostly because I thought it's too cheeky to just propose a file-change). But now he told me that it's better to just do it here: I'm asking because I spend a huge amount of time and effort on making it great and usefully structured for people who're just getting started with Jekyll. Therefore it's also great as a forked starting-point, if you ask me. Besides keeping the code clean, I also spend much time on making the site as fast as possible. There's not much CSS in use, the HTML output is minified and images are directly served from the repo (and therefore GitHub's CDN) instead of from third-party services. There's also a lot of ""include""-thinking happening for things like embedded Tweets, images or iFrames - which most people just inline in each post. When making a significant change, I also always make sure to write a few paragraphs about why I exactly did it as a commit message. And when it comes to really big updates, I write entire posts too (explaining all improvements and their benefits to the site's performance/look). Here's an recent example: http://leo.github.io/notes/v2/ I'm definitely sure that many people could get something out of it. Don't you think so too?",1

Security fix: OSVDB-120415 - Upgrade redcarpet to 3.2,0.97299314,Upgrade redcarpet to 3.2 (Security fix: OSVDB-120415) (#3652),Note: Please release a new gem version of jekyll after merging this. More information at: http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/120415 redcarpet Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the parse_inline() function in markdown.c does not validate input before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server. https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/9fc00d0814807064e2dc7343fc330f7cdcf8112a https://github.com/fiedl/your_platform/commit/8e707ebb947dd4277704849bcc4a383401d4bd0e http://social.schiessle.org/display/b38b1460c2b201329b1f4860008dbc6c https://gemnasium.com/gems/redcarpet/versions/3.2.3 /cc @parkr @envygeeks,1

Use Jekyll::Posts for both LSI indexing and lookup.,0.9818027,Use Jekyll::Posts for both LSI indexing and lookup. (#3629),"When looking for related posts, Jekyll was indexing Jekyll::Post objects, but finding related posts based on Jekyll::Post#content. This caused two problems:   Ruby 2.2 will warn on == if <=> throws an exception (and future Ruby versions will surface that exception). Because Strings can't be compared with Jekyll::Posts, this warning was appearing all the time while searching for related posts.   LSI won't return a post itself when searching for related posts. But LSI could never tell that we were searching on a post, since Jekyll passed post content, not a post object. With this fix, we can remove the - [post] from Jekyll::RelatedPosts#find_related.   This is a more accurate fix for #3484.",1

Improved permalinks for pages and collections,0.9475073,Improved permalinks for pages and collections (#3538),"This updates the default permalink style for pages and collections to match the site-wide 'permalink' setting.  If the permalink setting contains a trailing slash, either explicitly or by being set to ':pretty', then pages and collections permalinks will contain trailing slashes by default as well.  Similarly, if the permalink setting contains a trailing ':output_ext', so will pages and collections.  If the permalink setting contains neither a trailing slash or extension, neither will pages or collections. This impacts only the default permalink structure for pages and collections.  Permalinks set in the frontmatter of an individual page take precedence, as does the permalink setting for a specific collection. Fixes #2691",1

This allows for URLs that contain no extension or trailing slash to still result in proper destination files with .html extensions. Because this change relies so heavily on output_ext accurately identifying the extension of the destination file, this change also removes the feature test that tested support for permalinks with a .htm extension.  In order to support alternate file extensions, a future patch or plugin will need to modify the output_ext value, at which point everything else should work as expected.",1

(#3436),"Found by @EdMcBane in https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/3435 The strange regexp we were doing to replace the  bits in the Pygments output were wreaking havoc on Rouge output because Rouge uses 's to wrap line numbers. To be consistent, the output from render_ should not* include the wrapping  and  tags. It should just be what was inside. We can then wrap it in our own custom tags without using any regular expressions, as God intended. Death to regular expressions and HTML manipulation!",1

In contrast, Tom Preston-Werner has pushed 295 commits and 13,461 additions and 6,806 deletions. I don't need to have my name all over it, but I think I have worked hard enough over the last 21 months to deserve to put my name alongside Tom's and Nick's.

An ack of the codebase suggests that this was only added so we could force an encoding for rdiscount on 1.9 without having to check whether we were running under 1.8. Since testing for said method to learn whether one is running under a 1.9-like encoding regime seems to be a thing in libraries we rely on, we shouldn't insert this dummy method without also dummying every other part of the Ruby 1.9+ encoding system. This commit removes the dummy :force_encoding method to stop poisoning core classes for libraries we use, and moves the adjustment for 1.9-like encoding regimes to the one place where it's needed.",1

Moving Quick-start guide to own section,0.65634453,Give the quick-start guide its own page (#1191),"As a new user to jekyll I wanted to get up and running as quickly as possible. The first thing I did was jump to the docs (missing the example on the homepage - my bad) and look for the quick start guide. Since I couldn't find one I went for the 'Basic Usage' section. I ended up muddling around for about 10 minutes until I hit the home page again to see the simple - and very easy - example of how to get started. So, in this pull request I've moved the Quick-start Guide out to it's own section so that users who really are impatient (like me) can clearly look for and jump to the quick start guide, follow the super-easy steps, and be up and running in a matter of minutes. Interested to hear if this is thought of as being a good idea.",0

Instead, use Twitter Bootstrap as a base (while still keeping @mojombo's origin design), to give users a great initial baseline to build beautiful, simple sites. Defaults are more than just the starting point. It's what 80% of users are going to use. Look at WordPress and the default theme. May as well lead by example and start the user off right.  Add Bootstrap base CSS as a better reset and base layer Update default layout to HTML5 with boilerplate best practices Add title and post date to post.html (rather than including in the post itself) Make site title a variable and add to _config.yml Add page title to header Add default .gitignore to ignore _site Remove unused rss.png and .gitkeep Add Modernizr for legacy IE support",1

Fix truncation of overly long post names.,0.5267176,Truncate post slugs when importing from Tumblr (#496),"Delete the old truncate_post_name; it was called too late (if url rewriting is enabled which it is by default), didn't run (it tried to use + to concat a Fixnum onto a String), and even with those problems fixed, didn't actually shorten the string enough to use as a pathname. Instead, apply simple string truncation at the point we generate the slug, which is used in the filename and is the part that could be unboundedly long. I arbitrarily chose 200 as the maximum length; even shorter might be better (really long slugs are just visually ugly); it might also be nicer to truncate at a hyphen boundary.

faster_lsi: Massively accelerate LSI performance.,0.8919219,Massively accelerate LSI performance (#664),"Currently, Classifier::LSI rebuilds the index every time an entry is added.  This runs into massive performance overheads on my website; theoretically, disabling automatic index rebuilds, and explicitly rebuilding the LSI index at the end of the LSI repopulation should speed things up nicely. As a side note, here, I use pandoc-ruby to provide a more featureful Markdown transformer, so be mindful that the numbers I quote here have artifically imposed I/O overheads. With just the 76 posts I wrote this year (abysmal, I know), I come up with the following figures: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  16.91s user 0.88s system 97% cpu 18.302 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  2.72s user 0.77s system 88% cpu 3.940 total  With 109 posts, we begin to see even better improvements: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  51.00s user 1.47s system 98% cpu 53.060 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  5.04s user 1.12s system 91% cpu 6.735 total  At this point, we begin to see I/O overheads being slower than LSI when faster_lsi is active.  I call that fairly conclusive.  But wait, there's more.  I have 273 posts lying around... I wonder what happens if I feed them all in.  With faster_lsi, it was nice and clippy. Without it, I simply gave up, and went and refilled my cup of tea. And it was still going. Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  1277.86s user 10.90s system 99% cpu 21:30.29 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  34.62s user 4.43s system 96% cpu 40.430 total  That is, in anyone's books, a major improvement.  Note, however, that I don't know just how well this will perform with jekyll --auto because I don't know how it does the LSI rebuilds.  I think (but please, don't commit me on this) that the LSI is rebuilt every time Jekyll picks up a file change. So, all up, the performance improvement is massive, and scales depending on how many files you have.  At the last point, the improvement is just on 3200%. A more optimal solution would be to cache the LSI index and/or content data somehow.  I'll leave that to when faster_lsi takes over ten minutes to run.",1
