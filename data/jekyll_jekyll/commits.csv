4487,Fix #4856: Don't rescue LoadError or bundler load errors for Bundler.,"When it comes to bundler it's smart enough to know what to require, and in casees it's not, it's smart enough to accept :require.  In most cases when bundler has a LoadError (or otherwise) it's because there is a problem inside of the Gem itself and when this happens, Jekyll will happily let that error slip when it shouldn't, resulting in a badly placed error that is actually wrong. This corrects that so errors can surface properly.",Fix #4856: Don't rescue LoadError or bundler load errors for Bundler.,"When it comes to bundler it's smart enough to know what to require, and in casees it's not, it's smart enough to accept :require.

Use of .bundle to store my gems consolidates things since since that directory also holds the bundler config file. It also keeps a vendor directory out of the project tree for non-Rails projects.  Simplecov was not ignoring that directory though, which meant that the code coverage numbers I were seeing locally were wrong (and very frightening).

This is desirable both from a correctness standpoint, that the excerpt should not introduce any new content, and more practically to allow fast and easy detection of whole-post excerpts in Liquid templates using post.excerpt == post.content.  A common use-case is deciding whether to render ""Read More"" links on a page containing post excerpts. This commit does exactly that.  It avoids adding additional newlines to the excerpt content when the excerpt includes the whole post and adds tests to ensure that this behavior is correct and preserved going forward.

But now he told me that it's better to just do it here: I'm asking because I spend a huge amount of time and effort on making it great and usefully structured for people who're just getting started with Jekyll. Therefore it's also great as a forked starting-point, if you ask me. Besides keeping the code clean, I also spend much time on making the site as fast as possible. There's not much CSS in use, the HTML output is minified and images are directly served from the repo (and therefore GitHub's CDN) instead of from third-party services. There's also a lot of ""include""-thinking happening for things like embedded Tweets, images or iFrames - which most people just inline in each post. When making a significant change, I also always make sure to write a few paragraphs about why I exactly did it as a commit message. And when it comes to really big updates, I write entire posts too (explaining all improvements and their benefits to the site's performance/look).

6169,switch remaining textile test files to markdown,"Textile support was removed from jekyll core in #3319, and most of the tests switched to markdown at that time.  This changes the remaining tests to use markdown as well.  The vast majority of the test cases were testing things in the file name or front matter, so it doesn't really matter what markup format they use.  The one test that was claiming to test that textile was transformed had actually been moved to markdown as well, just not renamed.

7838,Register subclasses of subclasses of Jekyll::Plugin,"The Sass and SCSS converters are practically the same – only different in the input syntax and file extension. As such, we've created Jekyll::Converters::Scss which is a subclass of Jekyll::Converter, and Jekyll::Converters::Sass which is a subclass of Jekyll::Converters::Scss. When Site#instantiate_classes is called on Jekyll::Converter, it only instantiates the Scss converter, not the Sass converter. This change fixes that.

Instead, apply simple string truncation at the point we generate the slug, which is used in the filename and is the part that could be unboundedly long.

10845,faster_lsi: Massively accelerate LSI performance.,"Currently, Classifier::LSI rebuilds the index every time an entry is added.  This runs into massive performance overheads on my website; theoretically, disabling automatic index rebuilds, and explicitly rebuilding the LSI index at the end of the LSI repopulation should speed things up nicely. As a side note, here, I use pandoc-ruby to provide a more featureful Markdown transformer, so be mindful that the numbers I quote here have artifically imposed I/O overheads. With just the 76 posts I wrote this year (abysmal, I know), I come up with the following figures: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  16.91s user 0.88s system 97% cpu 18.302 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  2.72s user 0.77s system 88% cpu 3.940 total  With 109 posts, we begin to see even better improvements: Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  51.00s user 1.47s system 98% cpu 53.060 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  5.04s user 1.12s system 91% cpu 6.735 total  At this point, we begin to see I/O overheads being slower than LSI when faster_lsi is active.  I call that fairly conclusive.  But wait, there's more.  I have 273 posts lying around... I wonder what happens if I feed them all in.  With faster_lsi, it was nice and clippy. Without it, I simply gave up, and went and refilled my cup of tea. And it was still going. Without faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  1277.86s user 10.90s system 99% cpu 21:30.29 total With faster_lsi:   jekyll --lsi  34.62s user 4.43s system 96% cpu 40.430 total  That is, in anyone's books, a major improvement.  Note, however, that I don't know just how well this will perform with jekyll --auto because I don't know how it does the LSI rebuilds.  I think (but please, don't commit me on this) that the LSI is rebuilt every time Jekyll picks up a file change. So, all up, the performance improvement is massive, and scales depending on how many files you have.  At the last point, the improvement is just on 3200%. A more optimal solution would be to cache the LSI index and/or content data somehow.  I'll leave that to when faster_lsi takes over ten minutes to run.",faster_lsi: Massively accelerate LSI performance.,"Currently, Classifier::LSI rebuilds the index every time an entry is added.
