291,Added SSL Validation Override and CA Selection,  Added fields to login page to a) disable ssl validation or b) select   a custom Certificate Authority certificate to use with the server.

Added state to settings to store ssl validation choice or certificate   data.   Added fields to various HTTP methods to disable ssl validation or set   valid certificate authority if either setting is enabled. ,Added SSL Validation Override and CA Selection,Added fields to login page to a) disable ssl validation or b) select   a custom Certificate Authority certificate to use with the server.
