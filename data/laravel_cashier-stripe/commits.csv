For more advanced cases, the decorator can accept any PSR-3 implementation. We can define the desired logging channel name in 3 ways: Using the CASHIER_LOGGER variable in the .env file. CASHIER_LOGGER=default Otherwise the cashier.logger configuration value can be overriden in the published cashier.php: php 'logger' => 'default', Or by calling Cashier::useLogger() in the register method of a service provider: php Cashier::useLogger('default');"

983,Implement Payment Intents for charges and subscriptions,"These changes bring support for the new payment intents api to charges and subscriptions. As there are quite some breaking changes here let's go over the most prominent ones below: Any payment action will now throw an exception when a payment either fails or when the payment requires a secondary action in order to be completed. This goes for single charges, invoicing customers directly, subscribing to a new plan or swapping plans. Developers can catch these exceptions and decide for themselves how to handle these by either letting Stripe handle everything for them (to be set up in the Stripe dashboard) or use the custom built-in solution which will be added in the next commit. A new status column is introduced for subscriptions as well. Whenever an attempt is made to subscribe to a plan but a secondary payment action is required, the subscription will be put into a state of ""incomplete"" while payment confirmation is awaited. As soon as payment has been properly processed, a webhook will update the subscription's status to active. After these changes, webhooks will be a fundamental part of how Cashier works and they're now required in order to properly handle any payment confirmations and off-session updates to subscriptions & customers. The charge method now only accepts a payment method instead of a token. Developers will need to update their JS integration to retrieve a payment method id instead of a source token. These changes were done because this is now the recommended way by Stripe to work with payment methods. More info about that can be found here: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#transitioning In an upcoming update all card methods as well as the create method on the subscription builder will be updated as well.

990,Implement config file,Cashier is at the moment one of the only Laravel packages which doesn't uses a config file. I think it would be better if it was more in line of the other packages by making use of one. This is what people are used to as well. These changes add a config file and cleans up the way configuration is handled within cashier. Another small change is the rename of STRIPE_MODEL to CASHIER_MODEL since that env variable is Cashier specfic and not Stripe specific. This also allows us to easily add new config options in later pull requests (like the email reminder option in the payment intents PR).

New Composer requirements:  moneyphp/money: used for formatting money values symfony/intl: used for the above library to properly format money values (optional) ext-intl: used for more locales when formatting money values  This brings along some changes as well:  Removed the $currencySymbol setting on the Cashier object along with the useCurrencySymbol and usesCurrencySymbol methods Removed the $symbol parameter from the useCurrency method on the Cashier object and its guessCurrencySymbol method Refactored the formatAmount method on the Cashier object to accept an optional $currency parameter. By default it'll use the current set Currency. Also refactored its internals to use the Money library to format the value. The starting balance is now no longer subtracted from the subtotal of an invoice The rawTotal method now returns an integer instead of a float A new tax() method is added to the Invoice object which returns the invoice tax formatted with its currency  And finally the invoice pdf got a make over:  Subtotal is now displayed below the amount of each row and a total of all rows combined Discount and Tax are displayed below subtotal Starting balance is shown right above the total  If there's no discount, tax or starting balance then subtotal isn't shown.

However, the update to the subscription in Stripe itself was performed and the two states would be out of sync unless you implemented webhooks. We've decided to catch the card failure exception and allow the plan swap to continue regardless of the failed payment. This leaves the subscription in a ""past_due"" state.

1056,Handle incomplete subscriptions upon creation,Stripe changed the way failed payments for subscriptions are handled in their 2019-03-14 API update: https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14 This means subscriptions still get created if the payment fails but they get an incomplete status which gives the customer 23 hours to pay. Since Cashier expects a subscription to be properly paid for we should handle this scenario gracefully. In the previous API version a card exception was thrown when a payment failed so the only thing that changes with this change is that it's a different exception that's thrown. What also happens is that the subscription gets cancelled immediately if we detect an incomplete subscription so the invoice is voided and the customer isn't billed anymore. No subscription gets added to the billable entity so the developer implementing the feature only needs to handle the exception.,Handle incomplete subscriptions upon creation,Stripe changed the way failed payments for subscriptions are handled in their 2019-03-14 API update: link This means subscriptions still get created if the payment fails but they get an incomplete status which gives the customer 23 hours to pay.

1165,Encourage usage of VerifyWebhookSignature middleware,This PR changes the way we check for events. It removes the API calls to Stripe for checking if an event exists and encourages the usage of the VerifyWebhookSignature middleware. Verifying incoming webhook events by their signature is the recommended way by Stripe for making sure the event is legit. Making an API call to Stripe like we do now is a bit irrelevant as we can totally verify the legitemacy of the event by the signature alone. This saves us extra API calls to Stripe and should actually speed up webhooks. This also solves the problem of the CASHIER_ENV env variable. Now that the middleware is only set on the controller when the webhook secret is filled in you have total control of turning it on and off for your use case. The docs should be updated a little bit to encourage people setting the webhook secret immediately when working with webhooks. It's also not recommended anymore to set the middleware on the route as it's already been set on the controller itself.,Encourage usage of VerifyWebhookSignature middleware,This PR changes the way we check for events.

1173,Do not update card in createAsStripeCustomer method,"At the moment when using the createAsStripeCustomer method on a Billable entity, it could be that the creation of the customer succeeds but the updating of the card fails. When this happens it's impossible to know which customer was created in Stripe and therefor also impossible to remove this record again when the card update fails. It seems that the updateCard method shouldn't be in the createAsStripeCustomer method as this couples these two API calls too much. If we remove the call from the createAsStripeCustomer method it can be used just for the purpose that it's states. This will always return a Customer object and allow the developer to remove it again if the updateCard method after that fails. This is a breaking change which will require developers to call the updateCard method manually after call the createAsStripeCustomer. I've already adjusted the behavior of the getStripeCustomer call in the SubscriptionBuilder so there's no breaking changes there. You might notice that at the moment the same problem exists for the getStripeCustomer call but at least with these changes the developers have full control to first create the customer and then do a try/catch check around the updateCard method and revert the customer creation if they want. This will require changes to the docs as well which I'll send in as soon as this PR is merged.
