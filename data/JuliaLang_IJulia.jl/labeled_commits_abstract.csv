(#876) (travigd),"Jupyter removes IO handling callbacks associated with a cell when the ""status"":""idle"" message with the (parent header's) msg_id associated with the cell is received. New (asynchronous) output stream messages received after the ""status"":""idle"" is received will still be routed to the previously active cell under normal circumstances. However, if a new message is sent by the front-end, the last_msg_callbacks that would have put the output on an appropriate cell are overwritten/cleared and subsequent stream messages are silently dropped. This change means IJulia will delay sending the status:idle. Among potentially other cases, it will help when Interact.jl displays a signal but also has an error during an asynchronous push! to that or another signal. In that case Interact's javascript sends a comm_msg which clears the  last_msg_callbacks as described above, and the error message/stacktrace is usually truncated. With this change, IJulia will delay sending the idle by and the stderr messages will be displayed.",0

These changes allow for IJulia to work a version of Python that has been downloaded from python.org, where jupyter was pip installed with a version recent enough to include jupyter-kernelspec.exe and jupyter-notebook.exe, and where the end user has set the JUPYTER environment variable either at the system level or in ENV within their Julia session prior to building IJulia via Pkg.build. If the issues that led to the discussion in #363 and jupyter issue #448 have been addressed, then the changes in this commit and PR can likely be ignored.

The rate of sending is now controlled by a stream_interval parameter; a stream message is now sent at most once every stream_interval seconds (currently 0.1). The exception to this is if the buffer has reached the size specified in max_size (currently 10KB), and will then be sent immediately. This is to avoid overly large stream messages being sent. Improves flush() so that it will have a very high chance of flushing data already written to stdout/stderr.
