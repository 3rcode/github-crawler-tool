Delay sending the idle message. (#491),0.3584191,"- Set version to 1.21.2, limit tagbot to once per day. (#914) (@fredrikekre)","Jupyter removes IO handling callbacks associated with a cell when the ""status"":""idle"" message with the (parent header's) msg_id associated with the cell is received. New (asynchronous) output stream messages received after the ""status"":""idle"" is received will still be routed to the previously active cell under normal circumstances. However, if a new message is sent by the front-end, the last_msg_callbacks that would have put the output on an appropriate cell are overwritten/cleared and subsequent stream messages are silently dropped. This change means IJulia will delay sending the status:idle. Among potentially other cases, it will help when Interact.jl displays a signal but also has an error during an asynchronous push! to that or another signal. In that case Interact's javascript sends a comm_msg which clears the  last_msg_callbacks as described above, and the error message/stacktrace is usually truncated. With this change, IJulia will delay sending the idle by and the stderr messages will be displayed.",0

Faster polling IO improvements,0.2773502,Interrupt messages on Windows (#804) and warning for incorrect kernel path (#809).,"Instead of sleeping during the read loop to throttle the number of stream messages sent, we now continually read the read_stdout and read_stderr streams (whose buffers are limited to 64KB on OSX/Linux, 4KB Windows?) and add data read into our own IOBuffers for STDOUT/STDERR. The rate of sending is now controlled by a stream_interval parameter; a stream message is now sent at most once every stream_interval seconds (currently 0.1). The exception to this is if the buffer has reached the size specified in max_size (currently 10KB), and will then be sent immediately. This is to avoid overly large stream messages being sent. Improves flush() so that it will have a very high chance of flushing data already written to stdout/stderr. The above changes fix #372 #342 #238 #347 Adds timestamps to the debug logging and the task which the vprintln call is made from. Fixes using ?keyword (e.g. ?try)",0

Add space to fix incorrect macro call.,0.44314983,- Indentation error (#1070),"Previously, Pkg.add(""IJulia"") or julia deps/build.jl failed with an error message, the meat of which was ""wrong number of arguments while loading /home/christopher/.julia/v0.3/IJulia/deps/build.jl, in expression starting on line 79"". This was ultimately caused by the fact that the macro name @windows? was immediately followed by an open parenthesis. The parentheses were intended to mark the first argument of @windows?---this argument itself is a nontrivial expression---but instead, because there was no space, Julia expected all the arguments to be inside the parentheses. Adding a space fixes this problem (see link).",0
