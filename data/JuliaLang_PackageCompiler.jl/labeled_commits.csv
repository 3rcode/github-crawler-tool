Add create_library function (#490),0.89371896,- Add create_library function (#490) (@kmsquire),"  Add create_library function   Similar to create_app, this function facilitates the creation of   C shared library bundles using Julia.  As with apps, it generates a directory tree with required shared   libraries and artifacts. In contrast with apps, the julia system image is the main artifact   generated, and its name should be set to the expected name of   the library you're creating. One downside of this implementation is that any binaries linking   to this shared library may need help finding it at runtime.  The   methods for doing so are system dependent.",1
