Don't log HTTP requests to Telescope endpoints (#1127),1.0000002,Don't log HTTP requests to Telescope endpoints (#1127),"v4.6.3 started logging database entries for /telescope/requests, etc. due to the config('telescope.domain') checks introduced by 95631f9b8cabdfd64ed76abb0a5ddbb150855463  For the base configuration Telescope installs by default,    null !== $request->getHost() so requestIsToApprovedDomain() is    always returning true. requestIsToApprovedUri() is never checked and    config('telescope.only_paths') is ignored. This new method should    only consider a custom Telescope domain being configured. Return    true if nothing is configured as the URI will be checked instead. Exclude config('telescope.path') === null when another domain is    being used since ! $request->is('*') would stop any path from being    logged. Last week's commit was intended to fix this problem. config('telescope.only_paths') must also be checked even when    requestIsToApprovedDomain() is true. handlingApprovedRequest() must    be checking both domain and URI.",1
GateWatcher handles stack trace caller not found (#1128),0.68395203,Laravel Octane fix: GateWatcher handles stack trace caller not found (#1128),"For an app using Swoole/Laravel Octane and Telescope configured for config('telescope.ignore_packages') === true, method getCallerFromStackTrace() will return null. UI file telescope/resources/js/screens/gates/preview.vue will hide caller file location details if they're not stored in the Telescope entry so save that path as null. Also fix the getCallerFromStackTrace() @return docblock as that method was written before Laravel Octane magic was conjured up.",0

Remove unused code when formatting SQL,0.8931649,Remove problematic unused code when formatting SQL (#924),"Telescope's QueryWatcher always stores an empty array for query parameter bindings. This causes issues in NPM package ""sql-formatter"" when the query has MySQL session variables referenced with an '@' character. sql-formatter's generic SQL syntax handling will treat the '@' character the same as a '?' placeholder. 'SELECT @foo := id ...' without bindings will cause @foo to be replaced with JavaScript 'undefined' rather than being left as-is.  stop passing the bindings empty array    to the .format() method since the    argument is never used. instead of referencing the generic    'sqlFormatter.format()' public API,    pull in the exact implementation of    StandardSqlFormatter. Three other    SQL dialect implementations were being    unnecessarily bundled into Telescope's    app.js distribution. This will shrink    app.js' file size. remove unused  Vue    component props 'entry' and 'batch'    since query data is being injected    through the the slot scope.",1

Adding meta for disavowing robots,0.952539,Adding meta for disavowing robots (#703),"Adding this meta tag may disavow regular indexing robots (google, yahoo, bing, etc.), to index the contents inside Telescope URLs. Take into account that this is not a barrier to get access to the Telescope components, but at least may avoid those sensitive sections to get index by mistake (there are some indexed already). Additionally, adding this to robots.txt may disavow robots for indexing, but will expose your Telescope URL to the public so you may want to avoid this and using this meta tag instead.",1
