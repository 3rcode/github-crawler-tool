155,Bump acorn from 6.3.0 to 6.4.1,0.40903693,Testing fixes (#866),"v4.6.3 started logging database entries for /telescope/requests, etc. due to the config('telescope.domain') checks introduced by 95631f9b8cabdfd64ed76abb0a5ddbb150855463 For the base configuration Telescope installs by default,    null !== $request->getHost() so requestIsToApprovedDomain() is    always returning true. requestIsToApprovedUri() is never checked and    config('telescope.only_paths') is ignored. This new method should    only consider a custom Telescope domain being configured. Return    true if nothing is configured as the URI will be checked instead. Exclude config('telescope.path') === null when another domain is    being used since ! $request->is('*') would stop any path from being    logged. Last week's commit was intended to fix this problem. config('telescope.only_paths') must also be checked even when    requestIsToApprovedDomain() is true. handlingApprovedRequest() must    be checking both domain and URI.",0

Also fix the getCallerFromStackTrace() @return docblock as that method was written before Laravel Octane magic was conjured up.",1

This causes issues in NPM package ""sql-formatter"" when the query has MySQL session variables referenced with an '@' character. sql-formatter's generic SQL syntax handling will treat the '@' character the same as a '?' placeholder. 'SELECT @foo := id ...' without bindings will cause @foo to be replaced with JavaScript 'undefined' rather than being left as-is. stop passing the bindings empty array    to the .format() method since the    argument is never used. instead of referencing the generic    'sqlFormatter.format()' public API,    pull in the exact implementation of    StandardSqlFormatter. Three other    SQL dialect implementations were being    unnecessarily bundled into Telescope's    app.js distribution. This will shrink    app.js' file size. remove unused  Vue    component props 'entry' and 'batch'    since query data is being injected    through the the slot scope.",0
