This was done because there's some cases where we don't want the result to be displayed using ""notification"" but this is a problem for highlighting an element because it wasn't getting the result. This changes it so that 'ignoreResult' still sends the result back to the renderer but skips the notification if it's 'ignoreResult=true'."

833,Fix for xpath parse exception (#191)," Added try-catch so that if XPath.select throws an exception within the for loop, it just continues the loop and skips past the attribute that it's testing Added another try-catch within the entire method so that if there is some other unexpeccted exception, it returns null and we don't show xpath on the selected elements pane (this case is unlikely given that XPath.select is the only method that we would expect to throw an exception) Added regression tests that reproduce the above exceptions and confirmed the fix"

872,v1.0.0-beta.5 changelog,
873,Merge pull request #91 from appium/dpgraham-auto-updater-fixes,squirrel.windows 'first run' fix; fixed wording in auto updater
874,Ask user to close Appium instead of restarting it, Change the button text from 'Click to Restart Appium' to 'Click to Close Appium Now' Added a message in italics saying that the update won't take effect until Appium is restarted and that they need to wait a few minutes for the installation to occur in the background
875,Show link for platforms not supporting auto update," If platform doesn't support auto update (ie: !win, !darwin) show a message on the bottom of the Updater page saying it's unsupported and provide a link to the latest releases URL Aside: fixed foundUpdate.js to not do anything when the link tag to open releases URL is clicked"
876,On first run on windows wait 20s before update, Squirrel.windows on it's first run needs time to be initialized Wait 20 seconds before calling 'checkForUpdates'
877,Windows updater fixes (#89)," Round download progress and use mb instead of b Round the 'percentage complete' number (no decimals, rounding to the nearest percent is adequate) Update mock-updater to use higher byte totals for more realistic download rates/totals Disable autoDownload Add 'About Appium' and 'Check for Updates' menu Add check for updates menu in Windows"

882,Merge pull request #78 from appium/dpgraham-updater-component-height-fix,Use flex to align items in FoundUpdate component
883,Fixed bad markup in Update component, Was setting value on textArea without calling onChange; uses 'defaultValue' instead Removed nested 'p' tag; uses span instead
884,Use flex to align items in FoundUpdate component, Was using percentage previously and header was getting clipped Now it sets the container to column flex with  height 100% of viewport The header and footer don't have flex-grow set The body (which contains the 'release notes' textarea) has flex-grow=1 which causes it to take up all the remaining space The body is also given a 'flex' display type which causes it's children to take up all the space (height 100% on textarea doesn't work)
885,Don't wait for progress to show download indicator, 'downloadProgress' event sometimes takes time to emit so don't wait for it. Show the downloader at 0% downloaded immediately. Change mock updater to wait 2 seconds before emitting it's first download-progress event

1004,Use ES6 style for getting xpath,...because it's ES2016
1005,Removed 'selectedPath' from Inspector state,It was redundant having 'selectedPath' when we already had 'selectedElement' which has the path as one of it's properties
1006,Attach xpath to all elements,Each element in the source has a dot separated path ( [0.1.2.0] ) and an xpath ( //[0]//[1]//[2]///[0] ) . The paths are for finding elements in the source tree easily and the xpaths are for making calls to appium to find elements
1007,Removed unused code,
1008,Code cleanup,"Renamed some variables, added documentation."
1009,Added back button to inspector,
1010,Moved inline style tags into css classes,...except when the style is dynamic

1025,update license,

1027,Removed Immutable.js code,
1028,Incorrect xpath fix,
1029,Previous commit,
1030,Select element instead of just selecting xpath,"selectElement action sets the selectedNode which has 'attributes', 'xpath' and 'tagName'"
1031,Use Tree as a controlled component,"Want to keep track of expanded elements and selected element so that the data is stored in Redux instead of the component having an internally managed state. This will make the app easier to debug, and easier to refactor if we decided to use another component."
1032,Uses 'cards' for inspector,
1033,Can 'sendKeys' to element,
1034,PRev commit,
1035,Can refresh source by hitting refresh button,Also it shows a loading indicator over top of the inspector when the source is being updated

1039,Label tags by their xpath,Sets TreeNode keys by their xpath (generated dynamically). Added callback that when selecting a TreeNode sets the selectedXPath to it's xpath. Next step is to add functionality to call appium and have it select element by xpath and run arbitrary commands on it.

1045,Bugfix. Wasn't properly killing drivers,When window closes it needs to quit the driver associated with that window (if there is one)
1046,Moved method listener to separate function,"Method listener was being declared inside create session, instead moved it out to it's own so there's only one listener and when it receives requests it finds the matching driver for that window and fires the method"
1047,Cleanup of events,
1048,Added and binded a quitSession action,
1049,Shows screenshot of app in inspector,
1050,Inspector can get source from app,Added actions and reducers that send a method call to the main process. The main process calls the method on the appium client and then gets the new source and then sends it back to the web thread.

1091,Fixed bug with form submitting when it shouldn't,
1092,Can save most recent session,All state is managed by redux. I do question if we should be exclusively using redux to handle state though. If a component can manage it's own state without affecting the global object state it seems like we can manage it from within components alone
1093,Split session into 2 components,A session component and a session form component
