hcp: generate fingerprints on each new build,0.7345105,"     through the HCP_PACKER_ITERATION_FINGERPRINT environment variable, and","Fingerprints are how we link a packer build to an iteration on HCP. These are computed automatically from the Git SHA in the current state, and are unique to the bucket/iteration. The main problem with this approach is that while sound in theory, it quickly falls apart when users want to run the same build configuration twice, but expect a new image to be created. With the current model, this fails, as the iteration with the current SHA already exists. While this is solvable through environment variables, or by committing a change to the repository, we think this is not clear enough, and causes an extra step to what should otherwise be a simple process. Therefore, to lower the barrier of entry into HCP, we change this behaviour with this commit. Now, fingerprints are randomly generated ULIDs instead of a git SHA, and a new one is always generated, unless one is already specified in the environment. This makes continuation of an existing iteration a conscious choice rather than something automatic, and virtually eliminates conflicts such as the ones described above.",1

Introduce action-set-product-version for Packer (#12135),0.6631618,Version 1.4.3 of Packer,"This change introduces the new actions-set-product-version, a tiny, but mighty, GitHub action that acts as a bridge between the product repo and our new CRT feature: automated version bumping. tl;dr automated version bumping has a new command (bob update version) in the bob CLI that automatically bumps the version to a new patch. This automation has been introduced to crt-workflows-common as a new workflow (with the new bob command) and handles version bumping at the end of the release pipeline (after being released to production); for example, 1.0.0→1.0.1 and 1.0.0-dev→1.0.0. Bumping the minor version (ie 1.0.x→1.1.0) is only supported manually via bob update version -bump minor, but not supported in CRT (this work is upcoming). This is made possible by adding the new event “bump-version” in the ci.hcl file in this PR. What this small action does: Allows for the static version string from the version/VERSION file to be read by the new CRT workflow and automagically be bumped to the next version (whether it be a minor, or patch, or major version bump). Outputs an error if there’s no VERSION file in the version dir Outputs an error if there’s no version string in the VERSION file Is able to parse product_version if it is 1.3.0-alpha1 as 1.3.0 (example: when product_version = 1.3.0-alpha1, base_version = 1.3.0) Is able to parse prerelease product versions such as alpha1 (example prerelease_product_version = alpha1) in the statement above.",0

core: Update validation options for undeclared variables (#12104),0.6065906,     passing the -no-warn-undeclared-var flag to the validate command.," Update validation options for undeclared variables  In an effort to help users move from JSON to HCL2 templates the support for variable definitions files are being updated to ignore undeclared variable warnings on build execution. For legacy JSON templates builds no warnings are displayed when var-files contain undeclared variables. Since preferred mode HCL2 templates is to be explicit with variable declarations - they must be declared to be used - validation for undeclared variables still warns when running packer validate. A new flag has been added to the validate command that can be used to disable undeclared variable warnings.  Update validation test for unused variables  Example Run ``` ~>  go run . validate -no-warn-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl The configuration is valid. ~>  go run . validate -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable.

To mitigate against potential overloading of this field it is being renamed to be more explicit on its usage.  command/build: Add warn-on-undeclared-var flag  Now that the default behaviour is to not display warnings for undeclared variables an optional flag has been added to toggle the old behaviour. ``` ~>  go run . build -warn-on-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable.

This brings a dependency into the hcp package, which is not really necessary as we only need a few information from those entities, hence this commit removes the full dependency on the structures, in favour of more focused data structures where we only cherry pick what is necessary for this code.",0
internal: reorganise registry/HCP code,0.5648496," requirement to push metadata to a HCP Packer registry, in both JSON ","This commit reorganises the code for both the registry/API and the Orchestrator/Registry. The main difference with the previous version is how stuff is exposed. Now we only expose a Registry interface to the outside (previously named Orchestrator), which has several implementations: null is the default, and is returned if HCP is not enabled. The other implementations being HCL/JSON, both private to the hcp sub-package. The api (previously registry') is the set of functionality that abstracts and calls the HCP API. It was meant to be merged with thehcp' package, but because of a dependency loop with the datasources, both are separated for now.",0

This in turn reduces the amount of code that the commands have to integrate, and leaves the HCP details to its own enclave.",0
hcp: keep map of build names for hcp tracking,0.5853827,    enabled builds using the hcp_packer_image and hcp_packer_iteration data,"To be able to track HCP builds during a Packer build, we need to propagate the name used for registering the build to HCP. This works out-of-the-box for JSON templates, as the build's name is always the builder's, so there's no confusion on that. For HCP templates however, there's a possibility for a template to define a name for the build, which is returned by a CoreBuild's Name() function, in addition to the source's Type/Name. The builds are registered to HCP with the source.String() function however, which does not contain the build's name. This prevents any build containing a name to work, as their name/source.String does not match. The name we registered the build with is stored in a CoreBuild as the Type attribute, but cannot be safely accessed, as builds are types within the command as packersdk.Build, which only exposes Name() for this purpose. In order to circumvent this problem, and as a way to present a prototype of solution that will likely have to be discussed before we merge it, this commit hotfixes the issue.",0

This should prevent Packer from,"When Packer tries to get the latest version of a plugin, it will attempt to get the latest version from a list that is picked from the list of releases, fetched directly from Github. What may happen is that a release is triggered, the assets are not yet available, including the checksum file, which is uploaded last, at the end of the release process. This causes any client that tries to get the latest version of a plugin to fail during that window, as the code will fail immediately whenever a checksum file is unavailable. To circumvent this issue, and fallback to a previous version, we acknowledge that a checksum was unavailable then trying to get the latest version, and fallback to a previous one.",0

Currently the HashiCorp Cloud Platform documents the process for configuring Packer via a HCL template, which is the preferred route. This documentation focuses more on the use of environment variables for configuring Packer for HCP Packer, which is necessary for legacy JSON template users looking to publish to HCP Packer.

This will be used on the service side to detect if a build is stalled on the core side because of a crash or any other malfunction that caused Packer not to send an update on the status of a build.  registry: only update status on status update  Prior to this commit, we'd send updates to both the labels and the cloud-provider whenever an update to the status of a build would be sent. This would cause a bug in which once a build reached the post-processing state, and its cloud-provider was set, the status could not be updated anymore, as the cloud-provider would be set and further updates are rejected by the platform. To avoid this problem, we only transmit the status when doing a status update, and no other fields along with it.  internal: publicise CompleteBuild function  The markBuildComplete private function used to be called from a final status update to DONE, through the UpdateBuildStatus function. The problem being that the (now) CompleteBuild function not only updates the status of the build, but also all its metadata.

The GitHub action has feature parity with HashiBot so the migration should work as it did before. The GitHub action closes the original issues and creates a new issue on the remote plugin repository with the original contents of the issue to preserve history. We chose not to go with GitHub's issue transfer option because it completely moves the issue to the target repo, meaning there is not history that it was ever created on the original repository. In the future, we will look to add an action for closing remote-plugin issues that we no longer have access to. Closes: #11043",0

Update error messaging to bypass panicwrap only on non-recoverable,0.35155356,core/hcl2: Fix crash when parsing malformed provisioner override blocks.,"errors While working on this change it was found that prefixing an error message with the ErrorPrefix string would trigger a copyOutput function that would copy any outputted string to Stderr, until a new ErrorPrefix or Outprefix string is encountered in the output. During background runs of Packer an error message with the ErrorPrefix was being outputted which was causing all output, including Stdout, to be written to Stderr. This change updates the logic to only override the Stdout logging for non-recoverable errors. The idea being that any non-recoverable error should bypass panicwrap so that user know an error occurred. All other errors should follow the same behavior that we had prior to Packer v1.7.1.

Improve Documentation for Build-level Source Block,0.541299,     variable block that can be added to the build template to remedy the issue.,"The docs for top-level and build-level source blocks did not make it clear enough, early enough in the page, how packer merges their contents and fails when ambiguities  arise from redefinition. I know the info it there, but it's at the end and I feel that my modification shortens the page overall while putting the most useful info front and center.  Also, there is simply an error in the note at the end of this page, which further confuses the situation for new readers trying to use HCL and reuse source blocks. It's referring to a non-existent amazon source which is probably a past copy/paste error.  It took me a day to get re-usable source blocks working, bc I skimmed the page at first (I know slap my wrist), but didn't really grasp what it was saying in the Note at the end, and found it confusing. It wasn't until I found the Issues and PRs related to this feature getting added last April/May that I realized how it was implemented that I started to grasp what this was saying.",0

QEMU: Minor fix to VNC mapping parameters and output,0.5657273,qemu@v1.0.5 - CHANGELOG,"  Set the QEMU builder vnc_port_min to have a minimum value of 5900,   with updated documentation to explain why.   Changed output messages so that the correct port is listed in packer's   messaging to the user.   LONGER DESCRIPTION If vnc_min_port is set to anything above 5900, then packer will fail to connect via VNC to the QEMU instance. This is due to how QEMU parses the port for listening to VNC: host:d                TCP connections will only be allowed from host on                display d.  By convention the TCP port is 5900+d. Previously the calculation for the port was vncPort - VNCPortMin, however this will result in an incorrect port being displayed in packer's messages and potentially packer being unable to connect via VNC to the host. For example if vnc_port_min=5990 nad vnc_port_max=5999: Looking for available port between 5990 and 5999 on 0.0.0.0 Found available port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 Found available VNC port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 [....] ==> Starting VM, booting disk image      view the screen of the VM, connect via VNC without a password to      vnc://0.0.0.0:6 This will cause QEMU to set the listening port to 5906 while packer's VNC client is attempting to connect to 5996. I am a touch concerned as this commit undoes pull request #9905 (specfically commit 7335695c), but I am also confused as to how he was able to get QEMU to get a VNC listening port below 5900, as examining QEMU's git history has shown that this behavior has been in since at least 2017, probably older. Hopefully the more explicit error messaging and documentation can make it clear why this is being undone.",0

The check flag is mutually exclusive with the write flag and will only check if formatting is needed. The update write flag will now overwrite the source files with the newly formatted HCL2 source unless the -write=false or -check is passed at the command line.

Update HardwareConfig-not-required.mdx,0.35387775, publishing of metadata for any HCP Packer enabled configuration template.,"I've tested the behavior of CPUs and cpu_cores against both vSphere 5.5 and 6.7. In both cases, CPUs gives you virtual cores, not sockets. For example, I want 6 cores per socket across 2 sockets for 12 total cores. Based on the wording of this doc, I set CPUs to 2 and cpu_cores to 6. The documentation implies that will give me 2 sockets with 6 cores each. The actual behavior is you get 2 cores, and when you crack open the VMs configuration, you see that cores per socket is set to 6 -- which is meaningless. Setting CPUs to 12 and cpu_cores to 6 gives me what I wanted. So the wording I propose is  - `CPUs` (int32) - Number of CPU cores.",0

JSON to HCL2 (minimal best-effort) transpiler (#9659),0.45439345,core: Metadata for capturing template types such as JSON or HCL2 has been added to the,"hcl2_upgrade transforms a JSON build-file in a HCL2 build-file. This starts a validated Packer core and from that core we generate an HCL 'block' per plugin/configuration. So for a builder, a provisioner, a post-processor or a variable. The contents of each block is just transformed as is and basically all fields are HCL2-ified. A generated field can be valid in JSON but invalid on HCL2; for example JSON templating (in mapstructure) allows to set arrays of strings - like x = [""a"", ""b""] - with single strings - like x=""a"" -, HCL does not allow this. Since JSON does not make the distinction between variables and locals, everything will be a variable. So variables that use other variables will not work. hcl2_upgrade tries to transform go templating interpolation calls to HCL2 calls when possible, leaving the go templating calls like they are in case it cannot. Work: * transpiler * tests * update hcl v2 library so that output looks great. * update docs",0

builder/googlecompute: Add WrapStartupScriptFile configuration option,0.45083913,     variable block that can be added to the build template to remedy the issue.,By default the Google builder will wrap any provided startup script file in order to track its execution via custom metadata. The wrapper script can add a bit of complexity to the start script file so a new option is being added wrap_startup_script. This option allows a user to disable the script wrapping and just let GCE do its own thing when executing a startup script.,0
HCL2 only: Make provisioners and post-processors reprepare themselves with build data (#9534),0.6914194,core/hcl2: Fixes an issue preventing builds from pausing between provisioners when,"9444 allows to share builder infos with provisioners and post-processor by re-starting new provisioners and post-processors once the build has started; #9490 allows to 'excpect/only' on a full build blocks (after naming a block), merged together, the tests of #9490 fail. This means we would have to reimplement the only/except logic. While this could have worked, re-using the already started provisioners and post-processor for HCL2 is better/simpler IMO as we won't have to maintain a feature parity. Also with HCL2 and go-cty all struct ( here provisioner/post-processor) fields are set at the moment of configuring so we should not get weird 'default value' behaviour issue. This PR reverts some parts of #9444 and implement #9444 in a different manner: I created specific HCL2Provisioner and HCL2PostProcessor structs that both re-prepare themselves right before provisioning. I think this makes the code a little simpler and lays a nice ground for improvement.",0

fix builds on linux (#9031),0.53923726,    build. GH-11574,"  fix builds on linux   Build: Move to CGO_ENABLED=0 (#9057)   After further investigation on cross-compiling Go bins on Linux. I found that statically linking against GCC (for libc) failed to build for ARM and introduced a possible licensing issue as our bins would essentially be bundling libc into the bin. Diving further into cross compiling on Linux I found that the defacto solution is to compile with CGO disabled - this was also found to be the case for other HashiCorp products. Disabling CGO has the limitation of not allowing the use of any pkg that calls out to C (net, os), but in looking into the Packer code base and the relevant Go code base it appears that the latest versions of Go have pure Go implementations of the said packages so I believe we are good to go. I should also point out that CGO is disabled by default when cross compiling via go build. However, the GOX tool will enable it if it is not explicitly disabled. Below are three test cases executed to validate the compile bins work as expected. Build results after change ``` ⇶  make bin WARN: 'make bin' is for debug / test builds only.

hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables (#8834),0.6033615,core:hcl2: When a variable is set in a variables definitions file (i.e," hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables  In running tests via the CLI it was determined that when using the variable block with no explicit type assigned the type of the default value was not being set within the map. This change updates the decodeConfig method so that a type is always set for any defined variable if not specified. The second change is to properly handle the evaluation of basic variable types (e.g String, Number, Bool). Previously variables defined on the CLI or via PKR_VAR required some additional quoting to for proper evaluation. This change fixes that issue so that it works like it does in Terraform :) Build results before the change ``` ⇶  PKR_VAR_example='[""one"",""two""]' ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=home' . Error: Variables not allowed on  line 1:   (source code not available) Variables may not be used here. ==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created. ``` Build results after the change ``` ⇶  PKR_VAR_example='[""one"",""two""]' ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=""home""' . null: output will be in this color. ==> null: Running local shell script: /tmp/packer-shell885249462     null: two     null: home Build 'null' finished. ==> Builds finished.

The artifacts of successful builds are: --> null: Did not export anything. This is the null builder ```  tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update test to use Bool  Turns out a string value won't actually complain if it's given a non string looking value. It will just covert the value to a string literal so using a type Bool which should fail if given anything that is not true or false.  tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update unit tests  During testing it was found that by default the variable stanza were defaulting to a cty.NilType, and not the Type of it's default value. This change sets the default type of the defined variable to ensure variable evaluation behaviors correctly.

build using HCL2 (#8423),0.6392418,"    builds to with the HCP_PROJECT_ID environment variable. If no project ID is specified,","This follows #8232 which added the code to generate the code required to parse HCL files for each packer component. All old config files of packer will keep on working the same. Packer takes one argument. When a directory is passed, all files in the folder with a name ending with  “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” will be parsed using the HCL2 format. When a file ending with “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” is passed it will be parsed using the HCL2 format. For every other case; the old packer style will be used. 1. the hcl2template pkg can create a packer.Build from a set of HCL (v2) files I had to make the packer.coreBuild (which is our one and only packer.Build ) a public struct with public fields 2. Components interfaces get a new ConfigSpec Method to read a file from an HCL file. This is a breaking change for packer plugins. a packer component can be a: builder/provisioner/post-processor each component interface now gets a ConfigSpec() hcldec.ObjectSpec which allows packer to tell what is the layout of the hcl2 config meant to configure that specific component. This ObjectSpec is sent through the wire (RPC) and a cty.Value is now sent through the already existing configuration entrypoints: Provisioner.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) error  Builder.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) ([]string, error)  PostProcessor.Configure(raws ...interface{}) error close #1768 Example hcl files: ```hcl // file amazon-ebs-kms-key/run.pkr.hcl build {     sources = [         ""source.amazon-ebs.first"",     ] provisioner ""shell"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  post-processor ""shell-local"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  } // amazon-ebs-kms-key/source.pkr.hcl source ""amazon-ebs"" ""first"" { ami_name = ""hcl2-test"" region = ""us-east-1"" instance_type = ""t2.micro""  kms_key_id = ""c729958f-c6ba-44cd-ab39-35ab68ce0a6c"" encrypt_boot = true source_ami_filter {     filters {       virtualization-type = ""hvm""       name =  ""amzn-ami-hvm-????.??.?.????????-x86_64-gp2""       root-device-type = ""ebs""     }     most_recent = true     owners = [""amazon""] } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvda""     volume_size = 20     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = ""true"" } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvdf""     volume_size = 500     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = true     encrypted = true }  ami_regions = [""eu-central-1""] run_tags {     Name = ""packer-solr-something""     stack-name = ""DevOps Tools"" }  communicator = ""ssh"" ssh_pty = true ssh_username = ""ec2-user"" associate_public_ip_address = true  } ```",0

Create mapstructure-to-hcl2.go,0.45587832,core: Add enhanced support to Packer telemetry for HCL2.,"mapstructure-to-hcl2 fills the gaps between hcl2 and mapstructure for Packer By generating a struct that the HCL2 ecosystem understands making use of mapstructure tags. Packer heavily uses the mapstructure decoding library to load/parse user config files. Packer now needs to move to HCL2. Here are a few differences/gaps betweens hcl2 and mapstructure:   in HCL2 all basic struct fields (string/int/struct) that are not pointers   are required ( must be set ). In mapstructure everything is optional.   mapstructure allows to 'squash' fields  (ex: Field CommonStructType mapstructure:"",squash"") this allows to  decorate structs and reuse configuration code. HCL2 parsing libs don't have  anything similar.   mapstructure-to-hcl2 will parse Packer's config files and generate the HCL2 compliant code that will allow to not change any of the current builders in order to move to HCL2 to softly move to HCL2.",0

As with last time, here's a reminder for the next person who needs to update this:  Packer is different from all the other product sites. It uses a Netlify   container to build, instead of either the basic middleman-hashicorp container   or the hybrid thing that Vault uses. It doesn't come with all batteries   included, so it has to take fifteen minutes to build the universe the first   time you run it (or the first time you run it after an upgrade). After that,   it caches all the gems it built the previous time. So the steps to update it are a bit different. (Simpler, but more sitting around.)

There are no intermediate steps or copying of files involved. This means that there is no longer any benefit in having a separate directory to house the VHD files - see #5206 for the reasoning behind the introduction of this feature.

Ensure the export directory structure matches that of previous versions,0.44392586,"Fix LDFLAGS for release pipelines: Between Packer 1.8.5 and Packer 1.8.7, changes","Commit 3fc2defb6 altered the directory structure associated with an exported VM. The changes mean that the export process now stores the exported machine files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output directory. This commit restores the previous behaviour whereby the exported machine files and folders were stored directly in the output directory. This allows us to keep the efficiency improvements introduced with 3fc2defb6 while maintaining backward compatibility. By default the Export-VM command creates three folders in the specified export directory - 'Virtual Hard Disks', 'Virtual Machines' and 'Snapshots'. When a machine with no associated snapshots is exported the 'Snapshots' directory is empty. Prior to 3fc2defb6 the Snapshots folder was not copied/incorporated into the output directory at all. This was a bug. This commit preserves the legacy behaviour by not including an empty Snapshots directory in the export. However, if there are Snapshots associated with the VM, they are now moved into the output directory along with the usual directories containing disks and VM metadata. This prevents warnings/errors on import due to missing snapshots.",0

See #6392. Improves the efficiency of the compaction and export process by   reordering the compaction and export steps. Further improves the efficiency of the compacting step through   compacting the vmd* file directly rather than creating and then   operating on a copy. The changes mean the export process now stores the exported machine   files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output   directory. Previously the exported machine files and folders were   stored directly in the output directory.,0

The change allows users to specify the location the file is uploaded to, thereby allowing the user to specify a custom 'execute_command' that escapes any dollar signs that could be present in the path.

Extend upload and subsequent 'dot sourcing' of env vars to std PS command,0.49275014,"    is an alternative to using environment_vars for setting environment variables, "," Wrap funcs to flatten and upload env vars with new func prepareEnvVars.   While the wrapped funcs could be combined, keeping them separate   simplifies testing. Configure/refactor std and elevated PS to use new funcs to prepare,   upload and dot source env vars. Dot sourcing the env vars in this way avoids the need to embed them   directly in the command string. This avoids the need to escape the env   vars to ensure the command string is correctly parsed. Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS. The std and elevated PS commands now inject env vars into the remote   env via the same mechanism. This ensures consistent behaviour across the   two command types.  Fixes #5471",0

Azure: Don't provide location for build_resource_group_name,0.436487,     Builders with no defined name will continue to publish build,Location is required by default because you must specify where to create the resource group containing the packer resources. When using build_resource_group_name you are specifying that packer should use an existing resource group and so the location that resources are in can be determined by fetching the information from the existing group. It is forbidden to pass both variables as it is easier and more intuitive that the location comes from the group rather than ignore a parameter. Closes: #5655,0

When executed the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command configures the   firewall to allow management messages to be sent over HTTP (port 5985) This undoes the previous command in the script that configured the   firewall to prevent this access. The upshot is that the system is configured and ready to accept WinRM   connections earlier than intended. If Packer establishes its WinRM connection immediately after execution   of the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command, the later commands within the   script that restart the WinRM service cause the established   connection, and consequently, the overall build to fail.",0

Remove LGPL dependencies,0.40589774,core: Remove external plugin for Digital Ocean as a vendored plugin.,"This changeset performs the following:  Updates masterzen/winrm vendor to include change from (https://github.com/masterzen/winrm/pull/73). Removes masterzen/xmlpath dependency, as it is licensed under the LGPL license. Updates dylanmei/winrmtest vendor to include change from (https://github.com/dylanmei/winrmtest/pull/4). Updates packer-community/winrmcp vendor to include the removal of the masterzen/winrm/winrm sub-class as a result of the winrm CLI tool being removed from the masterzen/winrm repository. Updates nested dependencies as a result of the above vendor changes. Refactors parallels/driver_9 to use goxpath instead of xmlpath, as xmlpath is licensed under LGPL. Adds a basic unit test for the refactor work in parallels/driver_9 to confirm functionality.

Vagrant will stop overwriting this setting in an upcoming release which may pre vent proper networking setup. Below is the detected VMX setting: ethernet0.pcislotnumber = ""33"" If networking fails to properly configure, it may require this VMX setting. It can be manually applied via the Vagrantfile: Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|      config.vm.provider :vmware_fusion do |vmware|        vmware.vmx[""ethernet0.pcislotnumber""] = ""33""      end    end ``` This can be avoided entirely by removing the ethernet adapters from the VMX file prior to packaging as a Vagrant box, in which case adapters are created as expected according to the Vagrantfile specification.",0

Prevalidate Hardware Specs on Linux,0.3347633,"    architectures including arm, arm64, 386, and amd64","Prevalidates hardware resources on Linux platforms for Virtualbox and VMware builders. This is currently only available on Linux, as enabling for both Darwin and Windows platforms, relies on cgo bindings that would prevent effective cross-compilation. Packer will now fail to build and validate templates if the template is requesting that the VM to be created would allocate more system resources than the host system has available. This however doesn't catch parallel builds that overflow the hosts resources, will probably still need a better error message for VM's failing to boot in that case. Example Outputs: ``` $ $GOPATH/bin/packer build -debug ./vmware-iso.json Debug mode enabled.

Fix chroot builder to work with chef-solo,0.49521923,     using packer init or with the Packer plugins sub-command packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/chef.,"According to be5adb92b5c4d5d95e5089be94c706b930fea7ba, the UploadDir method supports two ways of copying depending on whether a trailing slash is used:     src = ""dir""  -> dest/dir     src = ""dir/"" -> dest On BSD-based systems (such as OSX, FreeBSD, etc.) the cp -R command handles these two cases automatically.  However, Linux treats ""src/"" and ""src"" the same. To support the trailing slash syntax portably, we can use:     src = ""dir""   -> dest/dir     src = ""dir/."" -> dest This works on BSD and Linux.  It is better than using wildcards as it grabs hidden files as well. This fixes #1196 that prevents the chef-solo provisioner from working with the chroot builder.",0

Merge pull request #701 from mitchellh/rpc-refactor,0.36293668,Bump github.com/hashicorp/hcp-sdk-go from 0.33.0 to 0.34.0 ,"RPC happens over single TCP connection per plugin now Three benefits: * Single file descriptor per plugin * NAT-friendly since plugins don't have to dial back in to the host * Opens the foundation that we can easily use Unix domain sockets and such A handful of Packer users were having issues with highly parallel (many builder/provisioner) templates where their systems would quickly reach their default file descriptor limits. This was because the previous mechanism would use a single TCP connection per RPC server, and Packer needs many (one per interface, basically).  This merges in a MuxConn that multiplexes many ""streams"" on top of a single io.ReadWriteCloser. The RPC system has been revamped to know about this and use unique stream IDs to send everything over a single connection per plugin. Previously, the RPC mechanism would sometimes send an address to the remote end and expect the remote end to connect back to it. While Packer shouldn't run remotely, some firewalls were having issues. This should be gone. Finally, it should be possible now to optimize and use Unix domain sockets on Unix systems, avoiding ports and firewalls altogether.",0

Fix VirtualBox scancodes,0.46172696,virtualbox@v1.0.3 - CHANGELOG,"Support for the backspace, delete and F1-F12 keys was added in commit 6028a3c. However, that commit seems to have copied character codes from the vmware builder into the VirtualBox builder. Character codes are appropriate for VMware which communicates through a VNC. However, VirtualBox communicates through simulating raw keyboard input and therefore needs scancodes which are key press/key release sequences. This patch converts backspace, delete and F1-F10 to scancodes. F11 and F12 are not listed in the scancode reference so they have been omitted.",0

As an alternative, maintainers can continue to use the packer-plugin-check by pinning the command to Packer 1.7.10.  GH-11317",,0
