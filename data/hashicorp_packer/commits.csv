2,Result of tsccr-helper -pin-all-workflows . (#12381),Co-authored-by: hashicorp-tsccr[bot] hashicorp-tsccr[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
3,Remove external plugin for Digital Ocean (#12376),The Digital Ocean plugin is now maintained and released by the Digital Ocean team. To ensure users are downloading the latest available version the plugin will nolonger be bundled with Packer.
4,packer: track template type in spans,"The template type for a builder, provisioner, post-processor or datasource was not tracked with telemetry data. This commit adds the infrastructure to track this, bumping the schema for non-crashes to `beta/packer/6' at the same time."
5,packer: add HCL2 support for telemetry,"Packer's telemetry package captures the field names from a configuration on legacy JSON templates, but did not contain any code for handling HCL2 template configurations. This commit adds a routine to extract the field names from a HCL2 configuration once flattened, and adds some glue code to propagate the configurations to the telemetry structures."
6,Update fix command autocomplete to work for JSON template files only (#12366),
7,Enhance zsh completion for the packer command (#12356),Now completes more commands and also matches template files both for pkr.hcl and pkr.json as suggested by the packer template naming scheme.

9,cmd/console: Add config-type flag to command help (#12360),It is not clear that the console command runs in legacy JSON mode by default and that users can specify the -config-type flag to toggle HCL2 mode. This change adds the config-type flag to the command's help text to alert users of the gotcha. In the next minor Packer release the console command will be updated to default to HCL2 mode. Relates to: #12359 Relates to: #10603
10,Update allowed dependencies to track (#12355),  Packer plugins rely on the Packer SDK for the majority of its HCL dependency. To prevent issues with the version of go-cty or hcl/v2 pkg getting out of sync this changes sets the allowed dependency to packer-plugin-sdk only.   HashiCorp is standardizing on pinning versions of allowed GitHub actions to prevent the introduction of potential security issues. This change removes GitHub actions from dependabot.

53,hcp: generate fingerprints on each new build,"Fingerprints are how we link a packer build to an iteration on HCP. These are computed automatically from the Git SHA in the current state, and are unique to the bucket/iteration. The main problem with this approach is that while sound in theory, it quickly falls apart when users want to run the same build configuration twice, but expect a new image to be created. With the current model, this fails, as the iteration with the current SHA already exists. While this is solvable through environment variables, or by committing a change to the repository, we think this is not clear enough, and causes an extra step to what should otherwise be a simple process. Therefore, to lower the barrier of entry into HCP, we change this behaviour with this commit. Now, fingerprints are randomly generated ULIDs instead of a git SHA, and a new one is always generated, unless one is already specified in the environment. This makes continuation of an existing iteration a conscious choice rather than something automatic, and virtually eliminates conflicts such as the ones described above."
54,internal: remove unused Labels on Iteration,"The iteration structure that we use for linking a packer build to an iteration on HCP defines a `Labels' attribute, which is never set nor read from at any point. Since it is unused, we remove it in this commit."

63,Introduce action-set-product-version for Packer (#12135),"This change introduces the new actions-set-product-version, a tiny, but mighty, GitHub action that acts as a bridge between the product repo and our new CRT feature: automated version bumping. tl;dr automated version bumping has a new command (bob update version) in the bob CLI that automatically bumps the version to a new patch. This automation has been introduced to crt-workflows-common as a new workflow (with the new bob command) and handles version bumping at the end of the release pipeline (after being released to production); for example, 1.0.0→1.0.1 and 1.0.0-dev→1.0.0. Bumping the minor version (ie 1.0.x→1.1.0) is only supported manually via bob update version -bump minor, but not supported in CRT (this work is upcoming). This is made possible by adding the new event “bump-version” in the ci.hcl file in this PR. What this small action does: Allows for the static version string from the version/VERSION file to be read by the new CRT workflow and automagically be bumped to the next version (whether it be a minor, or patch, or major version bump). Outputs an error if there’s no VERSION file in the version dir Outputs an error if there’s no version string in the VERSION file Is able to parse product_version if it is 1.3.0-alpha1 as 1.3.0 (example: when product_version = 1.3.0-alpha1, base_version = 1.3.0) Is able to parse prerelease product versions such as alpha1 (example prerelease_product_version = alpha1) in the statement above."

70,hcl2: don't warn on excluded post-processor (#12187)," hcl2template: use && for chaining conditions  For deciding if we need to run an error provisioner block, we checked using a nested if that we didn't need to avoid running it. This is unnecessary, and adds a superfluous level of inbrication to the code, so we chain both conditions with &&.  hcl2: don't warn on excluded post-processor  When a post-processor is excluded through the -except command-line argument for packer build, we used to print a warning on HCL2 templates if this except statement did not match a build. However, since we can use the except option to avoid running post-processors, we should account for this as well when printing out a warning that there were no matches. This commit adds this counter to the except checks for the post-processors as well."
71,hcp: remove superfluous return value on GetBuilds,"This commit irons out one of the pain points of the HCP rework by introducing a HCPPublisher interface, implemented both by the JSON Core, and the HCL2 PackerConfig, which keeps a map of the build names used by Packer to the build names pushed on HCP. This in turn lets us go back to the old implementation of the GetBuilds function, which returns a list of (filtered) builds, and eventually an error if something went wrong while processing."
72,hcp: set the status to CANCELLED when a build is,"Related to the previous behaviour problem, this changes how the status of a build is set on HCP Packer, as a cancelled build is different from a failed one, we can set it to the appropriate state on cancellation."
73,core: CoreBuild.Run error on cancelled builds,"When a build is cancelled by a user, the current implementation of CoreBuild.Run does not return an error signifying that there was a problem with the build. This in turn causes the HCP code to attempt to update the status of the build to DONE, but fails because there are no artifacts to push. This commit changes this behaviour by returning the error provoked by the cancellation to the caller, so it can be taken into account when setting the status of the build."

76,Update BuildBlock with valid HCL2Ref (#12167),"While looking into #11932 I found that Packer will throw an error when an unknown source is referenced from within the sources attribute for a build block. The hcl.Diagnostics error includes a Subject, which should highlight where in the HCL2 configuration file the unknown source resides. But when creating the BuildBlock no HCL2Ref data is copied over, thus the Subject is displayed with with zero value for an hcl.Range type. This change updates the build creation logic to copy the HCL2Ref data from the build block at decode time so that it can be properly referenced downstream. Closes #11932 Failure due to change in output ``` --- FAIL: TestValidateCommand_ShowLineNumForMissing (0.00s)     --- FAIL: TestValidateCommand_ShowLineNumForMissing/test-fixtures/validate-invalid/missing_build_block.pkr.hcl (0.00s)         validate_test.go:377: Unexpected output:   (                 """"""                 Error: Unknown source file.cho         -     on  line 0:         +     on test-fixtures/validate-invalid/missing_build_block.pkr.hcl line 6:               (source code not available)              ... // 4 identical lines             """"""           )     validate_test.go:379:  FAIL FAIL    github.com/hashicorp/packer/command     1.002s ```"

101,hcp: remove duplicated build registration for JSON,"In JSON templates, we register the builds to process on HCP at the initialisation of the Registry. However, during the HCP breakout, this code was duplicated with a slight difference for the JSON templates, and the build names were registered once during initialisation, with the expected full name, and once at the start of PopulateIteration, with the truncated name. This caused a bug when processing a template that contains a builder with both a name and a type, as both would be registered, but only one would complete, leading to the iteration being unable to complete."

103,command/validate: add option to eval datasources,"When packer validate is invoked, it does not try to evaluate the datasources before attempting to decide if the template is valid. In many cases, this works, but sometimes it will fail as the value is unknown by the validation code. Since the validation code for all the elements of a Packer template is left to be implemented by plugins, we cannot rely on checking for unknown values everywhere, especially since the unknown references are replaced automatically by a value of the right type for the configuration expected. So, in order for such configurations to be validable, we add an extra option to packer validate, that will let users evaluate the datasources from a template."

106,core: Update validation options for undeclared variables (#12104)," Update validation options for undeclared variables  In an effort to help users move from JSON to HCL2 templates the support for variable definitions files are being updated to ignore undeclared variable warnings on build execution. For legacy JSON templates builds no warnings are displayed when var-files contain undeclared variables. Since preferred mode HCL2 templates is to be explicit with variable declarations - they must be declared to be used - validation for undeclared variables still warns when running packer validate. A new flag has been added to the validate command that can be used to disable undeclared variable warnings.  Update validation test for unused variables  Example Run ``` ~>  go run . validate -no-warn-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl The configuration is valid. ~>  go run . validate -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable. To declare variable ""unused"" place this block in one of your .pkr.hcl files, such as variables.pkr.hcl variable ""unused"" {   type    = string   default = null } The configuration is valid. ~>  go run . build -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl file.chocolate: output will be in this color. Build 'file.chocolate' finished after 744 microseconds. ==> Wait completed after 798 microseconds ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are: --> file.chocolate: Stored file: chocolate.txt ```  Rename Strict field to WarnOnUndeclaredVar  The field name Strict is a bit vague since it is only used for checking against undeclared variables within a var-file definition. To mitigate against potential overloading of this field it is being renamed to be more explicit on its usage.  command/build: Add warn-on-undeclared-var flag  Now that the default behaviour is to not display warnings for undeclared variables an optional flag has been added to toggle the old behaviour. ``` ~>  go run . build -warn-on-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable. To declare variable ""unused"" place this block in one of your .pkr.hcl files, such as variables.pkr.hcl variable ""unused"" {   type    = string   default = null } file.chocolate: output will be in this color. Build 'file.chocolate' finished after 762 microseconds. ==> Wait completed after 799 microseconds ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are: --> file.chocolate: Stored file: chocolate.txt ```"
107,registry: don't use datasource output for ancestry,"The ancestry inferral code relied on HCP datasource outputs for deciding what would be the ancestry for an image built with HCP. This brings a dependency into the hcp package, which is not really necessary as we only need a few information from those entities, hence this commit removes the full dependency on the structures, in favour of more focused data structures where we only cherry pick what is necessary for this code."
108,internal: reorganise registry/HCP code,"This commit reorganises the code for both the registry/API and the Orchestrator/Registry. The main difference with the previous version is how stuff is exposed. Now we only expose a Registry interface to the outside (previously named Orchestrator), which has several implementations: null is the default, and is returned if HCP is not enabled. The other implementations being HCL/JSON, both private to the hcp sub-package. The api (previously registry') is the set of functionality that abstracts and calls the HCP API. It was meant to be merged with thehcp' package, but because of a dependency loop with the datasources, both are separated for now."
109,hcp: extract all HCP-related code to hcp package,"As part of the work to displace everything related to HCP from scattered places around the Packer code, we move it all to an hcp package. This in turn reduces the amount of code that the commands have to integrate, and leaves the HCP details to its own enclave."
110,hcp: keep map of build names for hcp tracking,"To be able to track HCP builds during a Packer build, we need to propagate the name used for registering the build to HCP. This works out-of-the-box for JSON templates, as the build's name is always the builder's, so there's no confusion on that. For HCP templates however, there's a possibility for a template to define a name for the build, which is returned by a CoreBuild's Name() function, in addition to the source's Type/Name. The builds are registered to HCP with the source.String() function however, which does not contain the build's name. This prevents any build containing a name to work, as their name/source.String does not match. The name we registered the build with is stored in a CoreBuild as the Type attribute, but cannot be safely accessed, as builds are types within the command as packersdk.Build, which only exposes Name() for this purpose. In order to circumvent this problem, and as a way to present a prototype of solution that will likely have to be discussed before we merge it, this commit hotfixes the issue."
111,tmp: move HCP logic to unwrap builds/post,
112,internal/registry: reverse image check condition,"In order to determine whether or not a build is done or needs processing, we check 3 things:  that its status is not done that its ID is not empty that it has no images linked to it  The was the image check was phrased indicated that we checked for the reverse, so we reverse the naming to make it less confusing."

114,packer: try previous ver. on unavailable checksum,"When Packer tries to get the latest version of a plugin, it will attempt to get the latest version from a list that is picked from the list of releases, fetched directly from Github. What may happen is that a release is triggered, the assets are not yet available, including the checksum file, which is uploaded last, at the end of the release process. This causes any client that tries to get the latest version of a plugin to fail during that window, as the code will fail immediately whenever a checksum file is unavailable. To circumvent this issue, and fallback to a previous version, we acknowledge that a checksum was unavailable then trying to get the latest version, and fallback to a previous one."
115,plugin_test: error on missing checksum file,"The mockPluginGetter would always succeed in returning a file from the list of suggested releases, which does not let us test what happens when a release is not yet complete, and a checksum file fails to be fetched from the source. This commit changes this behaviour so that we get an error when a checksum does not exist, mirrorring what happens in real conditions."

128,hcl2_upgrade: replace passthroughs by pre-visit,"In previous versions of hcl2_upgrade, we referenced a list of passthrough statements from the original JSON template to be replaced by their equivalent Go-template in HCL2.

This is suboptimal, hence this commit changes approach by pre-visting the AST from the original Go Template, escaping every sequence that is not covered by the list of functions we can migrate. Pipes are also excluded from this function."

164,registry: add function to detect explicit HCP,"The HCP_PACKER_REGISTRY environment variable had its behaviour changed recently, as prior versions of Packer expected the attribute to be forcefully set to a value that is neither ""off"" nor ""0"" in order to get HCP integration to work, or that a ""hcp_packer_registry"" block was defined in an HCL template. Now, this environment variable defaults to not explicitely enable, but instead to explicitely disable HCP integration, and the feature switch fall upon HCP_PACKER_BUCKET_NAME. As an extra feature, we keep the prior behaviour alive when it is explicitely defined as a value to enable it. That way we can report errors if the rest is not defined, rather than silently ignore it. This function we add to env is the first stone to enable this behaviour."

197,command/build: warn and exit when nothing to build,"When a `packer build' is run on a config that does not define anything to be built, the process would run normally, and only state that no artifacts were produced after builds were run successfully. This is misleading as we reach the end of the command without having a proper warning that nothing was even attempted to be built. This commit adds a warning when that happens, and leaves immediately after."

201,Makefile: bump golangci-lint to 1.46.0 (#11977),"Since we moved to go 1.18, we should bump golangci-lint to a version that supports it. This change is motivated by the fact that some valid go code was being rejected by the typecheck with aliased modules beign unrecognised, namely the hcl' module, imported fromhcl/v2'. This should not cause any issues as the typechecker should be aware that the package exported by hcl/v2' is indeed calledhcl', but for some reason, with version 0.42.0, it does not work."

207,Update CHANGELOG,
208,Update Packer to use Go 1.18 (#11927),This change updates Packer core Go version to 1.18. The move to Go 1.18 and not Go 1.19 is to allow the HCP Packer SDK time to upgrade to Go 1.18. Changes Made: * Bump go mod file to use Go 1.18 * Bump release pipeline to use Go 1.18 * Update plugin updater script to run go mod tidy for Go 1.18 * Update Linux job to use setup-go action
209,Set PRODUCT_VERSION arg in dockerfile (#11947),"Description In actions-docker-build we pass PRODUCT_VERSION to the docker build command. Since this was not set, the label did not populate properly which is used in a comparison to determine the minor-latest and latest docker image tags. A change merged in today (https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/pull/25) checks for this value being set in the docker build action, and errors out if it does not exist. This will unfortunately cause build failures in this repo on merges to main.  Testing & Reproduction steps To test locally: How I expect reviewers to test this PR: - same as above Links Related [internal-only] post about this: https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RELENG/pages/2416934922/August+17+2022-+Docker+Build+Failures"
210,Add github.com/vmware-samples to list of template repositories (#11937),  Add link to vmware-samples template repository   Update ordering of community tools 
211,parser: extract HCP logic out of the HCL parser,"Before this commit, some HCP-related logic was embedded in the parser, making all of it common to all commands. This complexifies the logic as some parts rely on the template being in a HCP-valid environment, and the datasources need to be evaluated in order for some operations to be executed. To simplify this and avoid those pitfalls, we move this logic to its own set of functions that will be performed after the parsing is done, on any valid HCL2 or JSON template."
212,packer: remove useless nil check on generatedVars,
213,command: move GetConfig methods to meta,"Since the GetConfig methods are common to all the commands of Packer that rely on a config to work, we move them from build.go to meta.go in order to make the intent clearer."
214,Update CHANGELOG,In moving to the shared HashiCorp release toolkit it was agreed to remove support for the following architectures ppc64le mips mips64 mipsle mipsle64 s390x since they are not part of the HashiCorp supported platforms. Nor are they available as a release binary for any of the Packer plugins. This change adds an entry to the Packer CHANGELOG to call out the removal of the said architectures. As we continue with the path of removing the plugins from Packer core supporting platforms outside of those managed by our tooling will be an issue for users as Packer needs the plugins to operate properly.
215,Update python command for reading in pull.json,
216,Update changelog scripts to work with Python3,Now that Python 2 has been removed from Macos 12.x and replaced with Python3 I'm updating the simple tools to work with the Python3 interrupter.

To avoid this behaviour, we add extra checks that return hcl.Diagnostics when they fail."
242,hcl2template: only iterate on known HCP datasource (#11883),"When we try to validate a build that contains references to hcp_packer_image, the data is not fetched, and the value is therefore unknown. However, during the decoding phase for the build blocks, we attempt to fetch the ancestry information for the current build, from the information previously fetched from HCP. Since we're validating, there's no way this is set, and attempting to cast without checking causes Packer to crash on the conversion. To avoid this, we only attempt this conversion if the value is known. Closes #11870"

This alternative will get the iteration linked to the channel, and is essentially a more convenient way to get an image's metadata from HCP Packer. This commit is essentially a backport from the Terraform HCP provider, for consistency between the two tools."

250,registry: add heartbeat call for running builds (#11846)," registry: add heartbeat call for running builds  When a build is running, we send periodic heartbeats to HCP Packer's API. This will be used on the service side to detect if a build is stalled on the core side because of a crash or any other malfunction that caused Packer not to send an update on the status of a build.  registry: only update status on status update  Prior to this commit, we'd send updates to both the labels and the cloud-provider whenever an update to the status of a build would be sent. This would cause a bug in which once a build reached the post-processing state, and its cloud-provider was set, the status could not be updated anymore, as the cloud-provider would be set and further updates are rejected by the platform. To avoid this problem, we only transmit the status when doing a status update, and no other fields along with it.  internal: publicise CompleteBuild function  The markBuildComplete private function used to be called from a final status update to DONE, through the UpdateBuildStatus function. The problem being that the (now) CompleteBuild function not only updates the status of the build, but also all its metadata. For consistency, we remove the indirection, and explicitely call CompleteBuild when we want to finish a build.  internal: block status updates on DONE builds"

261,Update plugins that use StepDownload to latest version (#11844),
262,Bump packer-plugin-sdk to latest version v0.3.0 (#11843),This change brings in updates to Packer's usage of the go-getter plugin used within the SDK for downloading ISO files. This can be a potentially breaking change for some plugins as the update go-getter settings in the SDK prevent reading/writing to suddir that require upload path traversal (e.g /tmp/.../etc/hosts). This change also includes 30 minute maximum timeouts for file downloading to prevent resource exhaustion. This can be an issue for very large or slow downloads if they exceed more then 30 minutes to complete.

448,Update handling of image metadata before pushing to registry (#11458),"When obtaining image metadata for a HCP Packer build, Packer core will use mapstructure to decode the image metadata and validate that is has all of the required data set. Before this change Packer core would fail if there is extra metadata fields in the image metadata that Packer is   not aware. This change removes the restriction of erroring on unused metadata fields. Packer should only care about the fields it knows and ignore the rest. In the future, we will add new fields to the SDK but plugins may begin sending that data sooner."

The GitHub action has feature parity with HashiBot so the migration should work as it did before. The GitHub action closes the original issues and creates a new issue on the remote plugin repository with the original contents of the issue to preserve history. We chose not to go with GitHub's issue transfer option because it completely moves the issue to the target repo, meaning there is not history that it was ever created on the original repository. In the future, we will look to add an action for closing remote-plugin issues that we no longer have access to. Closes: #11043"

During background runs of Packer an error message with the ErrorPrefix was being outputted which was causing all output, including Stdout, to be written to Stderr. This change updates the logic to only override the Stdout logging for non-recoverable errors. The idea being that any non-recoverable error should bypass panicwrap so that user know an error occurred. All other errors should follow the same behavior that we had prior to Packer v1.7.1.

1013,Add maps for statically vendored components,"This change adds a new set of maps for builders, provisioners, and post-processors that store reference to components that were once part of Packer and are now vendored. This file acts as a single place for defining this vendored components, which are then merged into the main components maps to be used in Packer. Quick test to ensure the exoscale-import post-processor is still loaded ``` // Validate that exoscale-import is in the know post-procoessors list ~>  packer.test build docker_centos_shell_provisioner.pkr.hcl Error: Unknown post-processor type ""badlynamed-import"" on docker_centos_shell_provisioner.pkr.hcl line 18:   (source code not available) known post-processors: [ucloud-import digitalocean-import docker-push googlecompute-export manifest vsphere-template docker-tag vsphere checksum docker-import exoscale-import yandex-export compress googlecompute-import yandex-import vagrant-cloud alicloud-import amazon-import artifice shell-local docker-save vagrant] // Validate that exoscale-import get loaded ~>  packer.test build docker_centos_shell_provisioner.pkr.hcl Error: Failed preparing post-processor-block ""exoscale-import"" """" on docker_centos_shell_provisioner.pkr.hcl line 18:   (source code not available) 4 error(s) occurred:  api_key must be set api_secret must be set image_bucket must be set template_zone must be set  ==> Wait completed after 2 microseconds ==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created. ```"
1014,Move to remote plugin docs for exoscale,
1015,Vendor exoscale-import plugin,"This change will vendor the new version of the exoscale-import post-processor component, but remove all of its code from Packer. After the v1.8.0 release this change should be removed entirely. This vendor process is being used as a workaround for decoupling the exoscale-import component without causing a breaking change in Packer. Users of Exoscale are encouraged to leverage packer init for installing the latest version of packer-plugin-exoscale."
1016,Remove plugin registration generation step,"This change removes the generation of command/plugin.go so that plugin registration can be managed manually. As we begin to break out plugins we will need to begin modifying this file, possibly with stubs to allow for the removal of plugins without breaking Packer's backwards   compatibility with 1.7.0. After 1.8.0 is released we should be able to   revet these changes so that we can continue to generate the plugin   file for those plugins core to Packer."

Also, there is simply an error in the note at the end of this page, which further confuses the situation for new readers trying to use HCL and reuse source blocks. It's referring to a non-existent amazon source which is probably a past copy/paste error.  It took me a day to get re-usable source blocks working, bc I skimmed the page at first (I know slap my wrist), but didn't really grasp what it was saying in the Note at the end, and found it confusing. It wasn't until I found the Issues and PRs related to this feature getting added last April/May that I realized how it was implemented that I started to grasp what this was saying."

It is useful to add the spot tags here as it should be more reliable than tagging them after the spot request is fulfilled as we currently do."

1351,Adjusted QEMU step_run_tests.go to reflect previous changes,
1352,QEMU: Minor fix to VNC mapping parameters and output,"  Set the QEMU builder vnc_port_min to have a minimum value of 5900,   with updated documentation to explain why.   Changed output messages so that the correct port is listed in packer's   messaging to the user.   LONGER DESCRIPTION If vnc_min_port is set to anything above 5900, then packer will fail to connect via VNC to the QEMU instance. This is due to how QEMU parses the port for listening to VNC: host:d                TCP connections will only be allowed from host on                display d.  By convention the TCP port is 5900+d. Previously the calculation for the port was vncPort - VNCPortMin, however this will result in an incorrect port being displayed in packer's messages and potentially packer being unable to connect via VNC to the host. For example if vnc_port_min=5990 nad vnc_port_max=5999: Looking for available port between 5990 and 5999 on 0.0.0.0 Found available port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 Found available VNC port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 [....] ==> Starting VM, booting disk image      view the screen of the VM, connect via VNC without a password to      vnc://0.0.0.0:6 This will cause QEMU to set the listening port to 5906 while packer's VNC client is attempting to connect to 5996. I am a touch concerned as this commit undoes pull request #9905 (specfically commit 7335695c), but I am also confused as to how he was able to get QEMU to get a VNC listening port below 5900, as examining QEMU's git history has shown that this behavior has been in since at least 2017, probably older. Hopefully the more explicit error messaging and documentation can make it clear why this is being undone."

From my reading of the documentation, it appears that the ""upload"" mode would indeed require a communicator, so I change the logic to check for that specifically."

1614,Proxmox-builder pass through boot-order,"Adding the boot field supported by Proxmox api and proxmox-api-go library. This is due to a change in Proxmox to allow for multiple boot harddrives which would break the packer proxmox builder (the hardcoded cdn boot value). Can be specified like the following example:          ""disks"": [         {           ""type"": ""scsi"",           ""disk_size"": ""20G"",           ""storage_pool"": ""vmstorage"",           ""storage_pool_type"": ""lvm""         }       ],       ""boot"": ""order=scsi0;ide2"",       ""iso_file"": ""media:iso/{{ user ubuntu_iso_file }}"" Not sure this is ideal, but it's a workaround for the #10252 issue."

Related to: #9174  command/fmt: Add check flag  Packer's fmt command now supports a check flag that will output the name of any file that would be changed by the HCL2 formatting engine. The check flag is mutually exclusive with the write flag and will only check if formatting is needed. The update write flag will now overwrite the source files with the newly formatted HCL2 source unless the -write=false or -check is passed at the command line.  Returns a diagnostic error if Format is unable to show a diff - equivalent to terraform fmt Updates testing to run against #Format and not the private methods of the HCL2Formatter; fixes ShowDiff test failure on Windows  Updates comments for exported functions   Add docs for fmt command

So I had to 'wrap' those manually by reading the code of the openssh package. Note that ssh.NewPublicKey works with any keytype. I should probably do a PR to ssh to have a NewPrivateKey & Marshalling funcs

Now, we perform the same kind of checks done by the AWS EC2 builder, and refuse to proceed if there is an existing image with the same name (same for snapshots). As usual, invoking packer build -force will bypass the checks. Closes #9839."

2189,Update HardwareConfig-not-required.mdx,"I've tested the behavior of CPUs and cpu_cores against both vSphere 5.5 and 6.7. In both cases, CPUs gives you virtual cores, not sockets. For example, I want 6 cores per socket across 2 sockets for 12 total cores. Based on the wording of this doc, I set CPUs to 2 and cpu_cores to 6. The documentation implies that will give me 2 sockets with 6 cores each. The actual behavior is you get 2 cores, and when you crack open the VMs configuration, you see that cores per socket is set to 6 -- which is meaningless. Setting CPUs to 12 and cpu_cores to 6 gives me what I wanted. So the wording I propose is  - `CPUs` (int32) - Number of CPU cores."

2196,hcl2_upgrade: fix a case where the generated type is wrong,"when it encounters map[string]interface{} or []interface{} types,  hcl2_upgrade now takes the 'most complex' entry from those in order to tell wether this is going to be a body body {} or an attribute attribute = {}. Before that the hcl2_upgrade command could be a bit random there. A way better ( but may be somewhat hard ) way to do this would be to use the actual plugins structs in order to generate the HCL2."

2221,JSON to HCL2 (minimal best-effort) transpiler (#9659),"hcl2_upgrade transforms a JSON build-file in a HCL2 build-file. This starts a validated Packer core and from that core we generate an HCL 'block' per plugin/configuration. So for a builder, a provisioner, a post-processor or a variable. The contents of each block is just transformed as is and basically all fields are HCL2-ified. A generated field can be valid in JSON but invalid on HCL2; for example JSON templating (in mapstructure) allows to set arrays of strings - like x = [""a"", ""b""] - with single strings - like x=""a"" -, HCL does not allow this. Since JSON does not make the distinction between variables and locals, everything will be a variable. So variables that use other variables will not work. hcl2_upgrade tries to transform go templating interpolation calls to HCL2 calls when possible, leaving the go templating calls like they are in case it cannot. Work: * transpiler * tests * update hcl v2 library so that output looks great. * update docs"

2223,"retry spot instance creation when an ""Invalid IAM Instance Profile name"" error pops up (#9810)","PutRolePolicy & AddRoleToInstanceProfile are eventually consistent but it is not possible to wait for them to be done here: https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/0785c2f6fca9c22bf25528e0176042799dd79df9/builder/amazon/common/step_iam_instance_profile.go#L117-L134 which was causing the CreateFleet to fail (100% for me).

Before this, defining multiple post-processor blocks after provisioning steps would run them sequentially, now doing this makes them start from the build's artifact. To queue post-processors you now have to define them in a post-processors block. This is a breaking change."

While the default virtio CDROM fails, setting   cdrom_interface: virtio-scsi with this PR succeeds. Some links: ISO link: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-legacy-server/releases/20.04/release/ubuntu-20.04-legacy-server-arm64.iso https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debian-installer/+bug/1605407 https://superuser.com/a/1376628/230508"
2661,builder/googlecompute: Add WrapStartupScriptFile configuration option,By default the Google builder will wrap any provided startup script file in order to track its execution via custom metadata. The wrapper script can add a bit of complexity to the start script file so a new option is being added wrap_startup_script. This option allows a user to disable the script wrapping and just let GCE do its own thing when executing a startup script.
2662,HCL2 only: Make provisioners and post-processors reprepare themselves with build data (#9534),"9444 allows to share builder infos with provisioners and post-processor by re-starting new provisioners and post-processors once the build has started; #9490 allows to 'excpect/only' on a full build blocks (after naming a block), merged together, the tests of #9490 fail. This means we would have to reimplement the only/except logic. While this could have worked, re-using the already started provisioners and post-processor for HCL2 is better/simpler IMO as we won't have to maintain a feature parity. Also with HCL2 and go-cty all struct ( here provisioner/post-processor) fields are set at the moment of configuring so we should not get weird 'default value' behaviour issue. This PR reverts some parts of #9444 and implement #9444 in a different manner: I created specific HCL2Provisioner and HCL2PostProcessor structs that both re-prepare themselves right before provisioning. I think this makes the code a little simpler and lays a nice ground for improvement."

I found that statically linking against GCC (for libc) failed to build for ARM and introduced a possible licensing issue as our bins would essentially be bundling libc into the bin. Diving further into cross compiling on Linux I found that the defacto solution is to compile with CGO disabled - this was also found to be the case for other HashiCorp products. Disabling CGO has the limitation of not allowing the use of any pkg that calls out to C (net, os), but in looking into the Packer code base and the relevant Go code base it appears that the latest versions of Go have pure Go implementations of the said packages so I believe we are good to go. I should also point out that CGO is disabled by default when cross compiling via go build. However, the GOX tool will enable it if it is not explicitly disabled.

3692,hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables (#8834)," hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables  In running tests via the CLI it was determined that when using the variable block with no explicit type assigned the type of the default value was not being set within the map. This change updates the decodeConfig method so that a type is always set for any defined variable if not specified. The second change is to properly handle the evaluation of basic variable types (e.g String, Number, Bool). Previously variables defined on the CLI or via PKR_VAR required some additional quoting to for proper evaluation. This change fixes that issue so that it works like it does in Terraform :) Build results before the change ``` ⇶  PKR_VAR_example='[""one"",""two""]' ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=home' . Error: Variables not allowed on  line 1:   (source code not available) Variables may not be used here. ==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created. ``` Build results after the change ``` ⇶  PKR_VAR_example='[""one"",""two""]' ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=""home""' . null: output will be in this color. ==> null: Running local shell script: /tmp/packer-shell885249462     null: two     null: home Build 'null' finished. ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are: --> null: Did not export anything. This is the null builder ⇶  ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=home' -var 'example=[""one"",""another variable""]' . null: output will be in this color. ==> null: Running local shell script: /tmp/packer-shell123467506     null: another variable     null: home Build 'null' finished. ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are: --> null: Did not export anything. This is the null builder ```  tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update test to use Bool  Turns out a string value won't actually complain if it's given a non string looking value. It will just covert the value to a string literal so using a type Bool which should fail if given anything that is not true or false.  tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update unit tests  During testing it was found that by default the variable stanza were defaulting to a cty.NilType, and not the Type of it's default value. This change sets the default type of the defined variable to ensure variable evaluation behaviors correctly.   Add a simple cty.Bool test case   tests/hcl2template/types.variables:  Enable quoted_string test case   Update hcl2template/types.variables.go   space Co-authored-by: Adrien Delorme azr@users.noreply.github.com"

This change updates how plugins defined in packerconfig are loaded to ensure that only successfully loaded plugins get the lovely message loaded plugin .... For any plugin that fails to load Packer will log that it failed to load the plugin and continue processing any other defined plugins.  Add a test to ensure loadSingleComponent errors when plugin does not exists

4117,build using HCL2 (#8423),"This follows #8232 which added the code to generate the code required to parse HCL files for each packer component. All old config files of packer will keep on working the same. Packer takes one argument. When a directory is passed, all files in the folder with a name ending with  “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” will be parsed using the HCL2 format. When a file ending with “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” is passed it will be parsed using the HCL2 format. For every other case; the old packer style will be used. 1. the hcl2template pkg can create a packer.Build from a set of HCL (v2) files I had to make the packer.coreBuild (which is our one and only packer.Build ) a public struct with public fields 2. Components interfaces get a new ConfigSpec Method to read a file from an HCL file. This is a breaking change for packer plugins. a packer component can be a: builder/provisioner/post-processor each component interface now gets a ConfigSpec() hcldec.ObjectSpec which allows packer to tell what is the layout of the hcl2 config meant to configure that specific component. This ObjectSpec is sent through the wire (RPC) and a cty.Value is now sent through the already existing configuration entrypoints: Provisioner.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) error  Builder.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) ([]string, error)  PostProcessor.Configure(raws ...interface{}) error close #1768 Example hcl files: ```hcl // file amazon-ebs-kms-key/run.pkr.hcl build {     sources = [         ""source.amazon-ebs.first"",     ] provisioner ""shell"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  post-processor ""shell-local"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  } // amazon-ebs-kms-key/source.pkr.hcl source ""amazon-ebs"" ""first"" { ami_name = ""hcl2-test"" region = ""us-east-1"" instance_type = ""t2.micro""  kms_key_id = ""c729958f-c6ba-44cd-ab39-35ab68ce0a6c"" encrypt_boot = true source_ami_filter {     filters {       virtualization-type = ""hvm""       name =  ""amzn-ami-hvm-????.??.?.????????-x86_64-gp2""       root-device-type = ""ebs""     }     most_recent = true     owners = [""amazon""] } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvda""     volume_size = 20     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = ""true"" } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvdf""     volume_size = 500     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = true     encrypted = true }  ami_regions = [""eu-central-1""] run_tags {     Name = ""packer-solr-something""     stack-name = ""DevOps Tools"" }  communicator = ""ssh"" ssh_pty = true ssh_username = ""ec2-user"" associate_public_ip_address = true  } ```"

Go's time.Duration is an int64 internally an mapstructure will take advantage of this and load the number as a int64 but 1 means one ns which is unexpected/confusing.

4539,Create mapstructure-to-hcl2.go,"mapstructure-to-hcl2 fills the gaps between hcl2 and mapstructure for Packer By generating a struct that the HCL2 ecosystem understands making use of mapstructure tags. Packer heavily uses the mapstructure decoding library to load/parse user config files. Packer now needs to move to HCL2. Here are a few differences/gaps betweens hcl2 and mapstructure:   in HCL2 all basic struct fields (string/int/struct) that are not pointers   are required ( must be set ). In mapstructure everything is optional.   mapstructure allows to 'squash' fields  (ex: Field CommonStructType mapstructure:"",squash"") this allows to  decorate structs and reuse configuration code. HCL2 parsing libs don't have  anything similar.   mapstructure-to-hcl2 will parse Packer's config files and generate the HCL2 compliant code that will allow to not change any of the current builders in order to move to HCL2 to softly move to HCL2."

4876,Docs: Add run_volume_tags option to the ebsvolume docs, Add note explaining temp override of ebs_volumes tags when the   instance is initially created
4877,Delete any run_volume_tags applied to EBS volumes at instance creation, Allows run_volume_tags to be set without requiring a major rewrite   of the (common) amazon builder code used to start an instance.   The common start up code tags the instance and all attached volumes   at creation. If run_volume_tags are set this means that any volumes   specified in ebs_volumes will initially be tagged with the   run_volume_tags rather than the tags set in the ebs_volumes   section  Once the instance is reported to be 'ready' the step to tag the EBS   volumes is run. Once complete all volumes should have the tags   requested by the user:  Volumes associated with the source instance should be tagged with   the tags set in run_volume_tags (if any) Each EBS volumes specified in the ebs_volumes section of the   template should only be tagged with its associated tags (if any)  
4878,More accurate error description; Add comments; Add output,
4879,Add option to enable tagging of the running instances volumes, Currently this results in all volumes attached to the instance   being tagged with the run_volume_tags. This includes any ebs_volumes   for which the user may have configured other tags. This issue will be addressed in a later commit

As with last time, here's a reminder for the next person who needs to update this:  Packer is different from all the other product sites. It uses a Netlify   container to build, instead of either the basic middleman-hashicorp container   or the hybrid thing that Vault uses. It doesn't come with all batteries   included, so it has to take fifteen minutes to build the universe the first   time you run it (or the first time you run it after an upgrade). After that,   it caches all the gems it built the previous time. So the steps to update it are a bit different. (Simpler, but more sitting around.)

5380,fix: correctly remove tencentcloud temporary keypair,"Tencent Cloud key pair cannot be removed if it is in a image, so when user doesn't specify any log in method, such as ssh_password, temporary key pair will be created and used, which eventually will always fail. This patch detach temporary key pair before creating image, so in cleanup step, it can be deleted correctly. Note that if user specifies a private key pair, we do not detach it, because user might want to use it when creating new instances from this image."
5381,remove image name check in tencentcloud builder,"Spinnaker uses packer to create images, but tencentcloud builder has name check to forbidden special characters such as dot(.) while it is absolutely valid in API side. This patch simply removes this limitation."

6517,windows plugin: prioritize AppData over default user directory ( UserProfile ),It was the default behaviour before. It is also standard for a binary to use files from the AppData directory. ex: https://github.com/golang/oauth2/blob/c453e0c757598fd055e170a3a359263c91e13153/google/default.go#L104 More on home: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory
6518,fix destination pathing so that it doesnt break on windows,
6519,Add support for whpx accelerator to qemu builder,Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX) is the Windows counterpart to HVF and KVM. It's an operating system provided component that provides virtualization acceleration support. This is kind of the missing counterpart to https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/6193. QEMU 2.12 also added support for WHPX. There's no support for libvirt on Windows so nothing was added in those areas. The popular QEMU for Windows distribution does not have WHPX support built-in for legal reasons as the maintainer does not wish to use or obtain any part of Microsoft's SDK to compile the distribution.

7551,Moved the progress bar out of packer.Ui and unlinked it out of all the packer.Ui implementations. Split up the terminal-related functions into a separate terminal.go and calculate the progress bar width by traversing through packer.Ui to avoid the issue with github.com/ugorji/go/codec serializing private members (or unsafe pointers) of structs. Shuffled some arguments around in getConsoleScreenBufferInfo in common/terminal_windows.go so that the interface forces the user to correctly declare a _CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO type.,
7552,Updated vendor package github.com/cheggaaa/pb to v1.0.25.,
7553,Moved the progress bar from common to the packer.UI interface and refactored it so that the terminal width is calculated based on each interface which returns a custom progressbar specific to its ui.,

7732,Tests for func to move VHDs to output dir when skip_export: true,
7733,Introduce a new step to collate build artifact at the end of the build,The new step collects together all the required build artifacts and places them in the output directory.  Reintroduce/add the code removed from step export to preserve the   legacy export directory structure when skip_export is unset/false Add a place holder for a future function that will move just the VHD   files from the build directory to the output directory when   skip_export is true Add tests for current functionality and placeholder tests for future   functions
7734,Fix up tests. Ensure export step stores the export path in state,
7735,Remove code to preserve legacy export dir structure from the export step,Store the export path in the state bag in preparation for use in a later step
7736,Remove deprecated vhd_temp_path option from documentation,
7737,Remove the option to place the VHD files in a separate directory,The export process now exports the VM directly from the build directory into the output directory. There are no intermediate steps or copying of files involved. This means that there is no longer any benefit in having a separate directory to house the VHD files - see #5206 for the reasoning behind the introduction of this feature. If a user wishes to house the build files on a separate disk from the output directory (perhaps for performance reasons or due to disk space limitations) they can still do so through the use of temp_path.
7738,Changes to the export process have made 'inline' build of disks redundant,PR #5631 introduced code to build/create disks directly in the output directory if skip_export was set in an attempt to optimise the build process. These are no longer required.
7739,Add tests for export VM step,
7740,Add tests for disk compaction step,
7741,Reintroduce the disk compaction process as a unique step,
7742,Remove disk compaction from the export step,
7743,Add checks/error reporting to compaction process, Report compaction results Failure to find any disks under the supplied path is treated as a   'soft' error and a warning message will be printed in place of the   compaction result. Any other failure will cause the build to fail.
7744,Ensure the export directory structure matches that of previous versions,"Commit 3fc2defb6 altered the directory structure associated with an exported VM. The changes mean that the export process now stores the exported machine files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output directory. This commit restores the previous behaviour whereby the exported machine files and folders were stored directly in the output directory. This allows us to keep the efficiency improvements introduced with 3fc2defb6 while maintaining backward compatibility. By default the Export-VM command creates three folders in the specified export directory - 'Virtual Hard Disks', 'Virtual Machines' and 'Snapshots'. When a machine with no associated snapshots is exported the 'Snapshots' directory is empty. Prior to 3fc2defb6 the Snapshots folder was not copied/incorporated into the output directory at all. This was a bug. This commit preserves the legacy behaviour by not including an empty Snapshots directory in the export. However, if there are Snapshots associated with the VM, they are now moved into the output directory along with the usual directories containing disks and VM metadata. This prevents warnings/errors on import due to missing snapshots."
7745,Remove now redundant function to copy exported VM files,
7746,Refactor the export step for Hyper-V ISO and VMCX builders, Fixes a bug that caused the build to error if users did not   explicitly set skip_compaction:true when setting skip_export:   true. See #6392. Improves the efficiency of the compaction and export process by   reordering the compaction and export steps. Further improves the efficiency of the compacting step through   compacting the vmd* file directly rather than creating and then   operating on a copy. The changes mean the export process now stores the exported machine   files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output   directory. Previously the exported machine files and folders were   stored directly in the output directory.

8262,Allow users to specify the location that the env vars file is uploaded to,"Previously the location the file was uploaded to was set internally and used ${env:SYSTEMROOT}/Temp as the destination folder. By default, in order to inject the required environment variables, the file is 'dot sourced' by the 'execute_command' using the {{ .Vars }} variable. Unfortunately the inclusion of the dollar in the path caused issues for users connecting over ssh as the (typically bash) shell running the execute command would try and interpret the dollar sign. The change allows users to specify the location the file is uploaded to, thereby allowing the user to specify a custom 'execute_command' that escapes any dollar signs that could be present in the path. If not set the upload path now defaults to using C:/Windows/Temp as the upload folder."

This patch will check to see if the driver that packer determines is missing a NetworkMapper implementation (by checking for nil). If it is, then fall back to using ""nat"" despite ESX not using the network type at all. This is what packer did prior to exposing the network type to the user back in version 1.1.3. This closes issue #5916."

8807,Extend upload and subsequent 'dot sourcing' of env vars to std PS command," Wrap funcs to flatten and upload env vars with new func prepareEnvVars.   While the wrapped funcs could be combined, keeping them separate   simplifies testing. Configure/refactor std and elevated PS to use new funcs to prepare,   upload and dot source env vars. Dot sourcing the env vars in this way avoids the need to embed them   directly in the command string. This avoids the need to escape the env   vars to ensure the command string is correctly parsed. Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS. The std and elevated PS commands now inject env vars into the remote   env via the same mechanism. This ensures consistent behaviour across the   two command types.  Fixes #5471"

8838,Ack! Forgot to include the test-fixtures/SomeDir/myfile.txt file...,
8839,Removed an extra '/' from the TestFileExistsLocally test in common/config_test.go,
8840,Fixed TestFileExistsLocally tests in common/config_test.go so that they're actually being run. Added a non-existent-protocol:// test.,
8841,Inverted the logic of FileExistsLocally as suggested by @SwampDragons as remote URLs are assumed to exist locally.,
8842,Fixed some things mucked up during rebase.,
8843,Fixed an issue with the previous commit so that when the user does not specify the cdrom_adapter_type to fallback to the original decision made by the disk adapter type selection.,
8844,Added support for specifying both the network adapter type and cdrom adapter type as requested by @night199uk. Also included the respective documentation for these new options.,
8845,Added support for specifying the disk adapter type to the vmware builders. This was squashed from the vmware-diskAdapterType branch (#2968) as submitted by Rami Abughazaleh icnocop@users.noreply.github.com. This closes #5671 and possibly #4885.,"arizvisa: Updated icnocop's documentation to include the possible disk adapter types that one can specify. arizvisa: Tweaked icnocop's support for the disk_adapter_type option to the VMWare builder that caused conflicts due to version skew. icnocop: Updated links to the Virtual Disk Manager User's Guide PDF to open in a new window and also added the Adobe PDF icon icnocop: Added support for vmware to specify the disk adapter type, ide or scsi (lsilogic or buslogic)"
8846,Fixed a race condition in builder/vmware/common/driver_parser.go due to a misunderstanding how channels work when you close them.,
8847,Added missing root path to path-finders for the VMware Fusion implementation in the vmware builder as mentioned by @SwampDragons.,
8848,Added parser for VMware Fusion's networking file. Replaced VmwareDriver's NetmapConfPath with a NetworkMapperInterface in order to handle the differences between VMware Fusion and the rest of the VMware suite.,
8849,Added the paths suggested by @phekmat and @SwampDragons for VMware Fusion... Although parser for the new mapper format is likely to be needed still.,
8850,Fixed oversight in VMware builder's mock-driver that neglected to initialize 'HostAddressResult'.,
8851,Modified some tests to require the PACKER_ACC environment variable to be set before executing them. This turns them into acceptance tests as per CONTRIBUTING.md.,
8852,"When specifying NONE for serial or parallel in the VMware builder, disable the serial and parallel port devices entirely.",
8853,Added missing GetVmwareDriver() method to VMware Builder's DriverMock.,
8854,Updated imports of github.com/mitchellh/packer to new naming scheme github.com/hashicorp/packer,
8855,Replaced a hacky type assertion in the VMware builder with a call to Driver.GetVmwareDriver() that returns the driver-specific structure for ip and addressing information. Also implemented the addressing functions for the ESXi driver interface.,This fixes an issue where a driver might not have defined a VmwareDriver by forcing a developer to implement it via the standard Driver interface.
8856,Added support for the NONE option to be specified for parallel and serial ports in the vmware iso builder.,
8857,go fmt on builder/vmware/*,
8858,Added support for auto-detection to the serial and parallel port types.,"Included the yield option to all the serial port types. Added the ability for the network type to fallback to a custom network if the     specified network name is not found in netmap.conf. Promoted the scope for both Read{Dhcp,Netmap}Config inside vmwcommon.driver. Updated the documentation for the VMware builder."
8859,"Added the ability for the vmware-builder to fallback and determine the network device-name using the .vmx configuration in case of a guest using the ""custom"" connection type.",
8860,Implemented the unit-tests for builder/vmware/iso/step_create_vmx.go,
8861,Ugh..missing argument in VMware builder's driver_esx5 unit-test due to api change for .HostIP(). Fixed.,
8862,Completely forgot to support the unix paths in each of the drivers for the VMware builder. Fixed.,
8863,Fixed bad ORs and a bad fmtstring.,
8864,"Added support for sound, serial ports, parallel ports, usb, and specifying a default network to the vmware builder.","builder/vmware/{iso,vmx}:     Added the specific configuration options that get parsed.     Normalize paths when pulling them from the json template so that they'll work on Windows too.     Added some improved error checking when parsing these options.     Stash the vm's network connection type so that other steps can figure out addressing information     Modified the esx5 driver to support the new addressing logic.     Modified the template in step_create_vmx to include the new options. builder/vmware/common:     Implemented a parser for vmware's configuration files to the vmware builder.     Modified the driver's interface to include support for resolving both guest/host hw and ip addresses     Implemented a base structure with some methods that implement these features.     Rewrote all ip and mac address dependent code to utilize these new methods.     Removed host_ip and guest_ip due to their logic being moved directly into a         base-structure used by each driver. The code was explicitly checking runtime.GOOS         instead of portably using net.Interfaces() anyways.     Updated driver_mock to support the new addressing methods"

Added some more comprehensive tests for the relative uri/pathing.     Replaced the Windows Object Manager name test as the Object         Manager's naming scheme is different from a UNC path.     Modified the FilePaths tests to support the policy of windows absolute         paths being prefixed with the / introduced with PR #5761."

9066,Updated the testcases in common/download_test.go to pass a non-nil progress-bar due to the removal of a pointer type in commit ed2e341b7d7f49a063dd5018701b4ae548b8ec14 from yesterday.,
9067,Consolidated progress bar's appearance into the GetDefaultProgressBar() function. Updated dependency for cheggaaa's progress-bar from the gopkg.in location to the better maintained one on github.com.,
9068,Added second argument for custom-formatted progress-bar to NewDownloadClient in common/download_test.go. This second parameter was added as a result of commit f0bd9018f3e318caafb1fe7d46e04c470e07c092 which lets you customize the progress-bar format.,
9069,Consolidated the progress-bar's format into common/step_download.go. Removed DownloadClient's PercentProgress callback since cheggaaa's progress-bar already does that.,

9081,"Fixed some of the unit-tests in common/ due to the changes made in {config,download}.go",config.go: Fixed some issues related to the url scheme not being lowercased which broke some of the tests. config_test.go: Removed the UNC share test for \host\share\file since SMB support has been moved to a different uri scheme. download_test.go: Explicitly set the CopyFile configuration option for all the unit-tests that test file copying capability. Removed the UNC share testcase since it's under a different uri scheme now. Modified the file:// UNC share testcase to explicitly test the smb:// uri. Changed the incorrect t.Errorf calls to t.Logf so that the tests can pass.
9082,Refactored the code a bit to move the CopyFile hack out of DownloadClient and instead into each protocol.,"config.go: Removed all of the windows-specific net/url hackery since it's now handled mostly by download.go Removed the replacement of '\' with '/' since url.Parse does it now. Added knowledge of the other protocols implemented in download.go (ftp, smb) Removed some modules that were unused in this commit. download.go: Moved the file-path conversions for the different protocols into their own internally callable functions. Shuffled some of the functions around in case someone wants to implement the ability to resume. Modified DownloadClient.Get to remove the CopyFile special case and trust the protocol implementations if a user doesn't want to copy the file. Since all the protocols except for HTTPDownloader implement Cancel, added a Resume method as a placeholder for another developer to implement. Added a few missing names from their function definitions. Fixed the syntax in a few lines due to my suckage at go. Adjusted the types for progress and total so that they support 64-bit sizes. Removed the usage of the bufio library since it wasn't really being used."
9083,"Added the file, ftp, and smb downloaders to common/download.go",

Switched to using Go's built-in os/user package for retrieving the current username. @rickard-von-essen had done this in 7369841, but moved away from it in d59844f because, at the time, it wasn't possible to use that library with cross-compilation.

9257,use latest go for travis tests,
9258,Azure: Don't provide location for build_resource_group_name,Location is required by default because you must specify where to create the resource group containing the packer resources. When using build_resource_group_name you are specifying that packer should use an existing resource group and so the location that resources are in can be determined by fetching the information from the existing group. It is forbidden to pass both variables as it is easier and more intuitive that the location comes from the group rather than ignore a parameter. Closes: #5655

We believe that there was a bug uploading that image to Manta but that the metadata of the image was already populated and thus packer was reporting success as it was just checking for the metadata presence This PR changes Packer to wait for the state of the image to be active to make sure that it has fully uploaded and is ready for use ``` ==> triton: Stopping source machine (61647c3c-f2bf-4e30-b4bc-f076d3b01522)... ==> triton: Waiting for source machine to stop (61647c3c-f2bf-4e30-b4bc-f076d3b01522)... ==> triton: Creating image from source machine... ==> triton: Waiting for image to become available... ==> triton: Deleting source machine... ==> triton: Waiting for source machine to be deleted...

9392,builder/googlecompute: Derive network and subnetwork IDs locally,"This change constructs partial URLs for networks and subnetworks if they are not already partial or full URLs (i.e., they do not contain a '/' in their name). Network and subnetwork self-links are no longer retrieved from the API. Previously, if a user did not provide the network or subnetwork as a fully-qualified URL (i.e., self-link), the builder would make compute.(sub)networks.get API calls with the provided identifier to discover the self-link. This requires the user or service account Packer is using to have permission to describe those network resources, which is becoming less common as IAM is used more. Specifically, a user may have permission to launch a VM into a network/subnetwork, but will not have permission to call APIs to describe network resources."

While the wrapped funcs could be combined, keeping them separate   simplifies testing. Configure/refactor std and elevated PS to use new funcs to prepare,   upload and dot source env vars. Dot sourcing the env vars in this way avoids the need to embed them   directly in the command string. This avoids the need to escape the env   vars to ensure the command string is correctly parsed. Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS. The std and elevated PS commands now inject env vars into the remote   env via the same mechanism. This ensures consistent behaviour across the   two command types.  Fixes #5471"

9520,Manually set up all required for remote management. Use in-built FW rules,"Use of 'winrm quickconfig' can sometimes cause the Packer build to fail shortly after the WinRM connection is established.  When executed the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command configures the   firewall to allow management messages to be sent over HTTP (port 5985) This undoes the previous command in the script that configured the   firewall to prevent this access. The upshot is that the system is configured and ready to accept WinRM   connections earlier than intended. If Packer establishes its WinRM connection immediately after execution   of the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command, the later commands within the   script that restart the WinRM service cause the established   connection, and consequently, the overall build to fail."

Delete file containing encode/decode functions since we no longer   need them. Fixes leak of output on progress streams for both normal and elevated   commands.

Removes masterzen/xmlpath dependency, as it is licensed under the LGPL license. Updates dylanmei/winrmtest vendor to include change from (https://github.com/dylanmei/winrmtest/pull/4). Updates packer-community/winrmcp vendor to include the removal of the masterzen/winrm/winrm sub-class as a result of the winrm CLI tool being removed from the masterzen/winrm repository. Updates nested dependencies as a result of the above vendor changes. Refactors parallels/driver_9 to use goxpath instead of xmlpath, as xmlpath is licensed under LGPL. Adds a basic unit test for the refactor work in parallels/driver_9 to confirm functionality.

This change draws on the example in the chef-solo provisioner on how to detect the OS in use and use an appropriate mkdir command. In addition to updating the mkdir command, the actual executeCommand needs to be OS specific, since Windows doesn't have sudo and Unix doesn't require 'SET' when trying to change the value of a variable. Modify the actual Windows command used to run Puppet. Since the Facter vars on Windows are set with 'SET =', a '&&' is needed between the SET commands and the actual Puppet invocation."

10470,builder/vmware: Add vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces,"This commit adds a new option, vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces, to both of the VMWare builders. This is useful when building Vagrant boxes, since Vagrant now produces output such as: ``` WARNING: The VMX file for this box contains a setting that is automatically overwritten by Vagrant when started. Vagrant will stop overwriting this setting in an upcoming release which may pre vent proper networking setup. Below is the detected VMX setting: ethernet0.pcislotnumber = ""33"" If networking fails to properly configure, it may require this VMX setting. It can be manually applied via the Vagrantfile: Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|      config.vm.provider :vmware_fusion do |vmware|        vmware.vmx[""ethernet0.pcislotnumber""] = ""33""      end    end ``` This can be avoided entirely by removing the ethernet adapters from the VMX file prior to packaging as a Vagrant box, in which case adapters are created as expected according to the Vagrantfile specification."

This allows for both encrypted keys and ECDSA keys to be used. In addition, a fix is made to not pass in an empty array of networks if none are specified in configuration, thus honouring the API default of putting instances with no explicit networks specified on the Joyent public and internal shared networks."

Consequently, this commit adds in the following steps:  StepPrevalidate StepTagEBSVolumes StepDeregisterAMI StepCreateEncryptedAMICopy StepAMIRegionCopy StepModifyAMIAttribute StepCreateTags  We also fix the interpolation filter and documentation to reflect these additions, though the majority were already documented and just not functional."

11036,Reduce character set for passwords,"At the beginning of each VMware build packer generates a random VNC password and prints it to the terminal / log. When copying a password from a terminal emulator with double-click, the text selection uses word boundaries to attempt to automatically detect where the password string is located. When the password contains weird characers like %^&# this parsing fails and you only get half the password. The reduction in characters does not significantly reduce the entropy of the password but improves user-friendliness when you actually want to use it. Also deletedsome unused files"

Assuming the scp target is a file instead of a directory allows uploading files to a node being provisioned with the ssh communciator using sftp and with the winrm communicator. It is fully compatible with ansible; ansible communicators only allow for files (never directories) to be uploaded (when the copy module is used to upload a directory, ansible walks the directory and uploads files one at a time). Update documentation to explain how to provision a Windows image. Extend tests that use ssh to communicate with the node to include single files, recursive copies, and content-only recursive copies. Add test to verify support for the winrm communicator. Remove the err argument from adapter.scpExec, because it was unused. Fixes #3911"

The correct port to open in the firewall is different for the type of firewall used. The standard firewall requires the public port to be opened and the network ACL requires the private port to be opened. So by partially reverting this code and updating which ports to open in which cases, we can support all use cases again."

11781,builder/amazon: Allow use of local SSH Agent,"This commit adds an option to use the local SSH Agent to authenticate connections to source instances started by the the EBS and Instance Store builders. This is of use when the source AMI already has configuration for authorized SSH keys - for example if one uses an SSH certificate authority. A further extension (not implemented in this commit) is to allow SSH agent use with a pre-defined key pair, in order to allow keys with passphrases to be used without giving the passphrase to Packer."

12807,Prevalidate Hardware Specs on Linux,"Prevalidates hardware resources on Linux platforms for Virtualbox and VMware builders. This is currently only available on Linux, as enabling for both Darwin and Windows platforms, relies on cgo bindings that would prevent effective cross-compilation. Packer will now fail to build and validate templates if the template is requesting that the VM to be created would allocate more system resources than the host system has available. This however doesn't catch parallel builds that overflow the hosts resources, will probably still need a better error message for VM's failing to boot in that case. Example Outputs: ``` $ $GOPATH/bin/packer build -debug ./vmware-iso.json Debug mode enabled. Builds will not be parallelized. vmware-iso output will be in this color. 2 error(s) occurred:  Unavailable Resources: RAM - Requested - 204800000MB - Available 21721MB Unavailable Resources: Disk - Requested - 4000000000MB - Available 76701MB ```  ``` $ $GOPATH/bin/packer build -debug ./vbox-iso.json Debug mode enabled.

The ssh_keypair_name option by itself won't make that change, because it doesn't make sense to specify a keypair but not tell packer where the private key is, but it does happen that you could have a private key and the public-key is ""baked in"", and not part of your EC2 account."
14366,First attempt for re-using a named EC2 keypair,"Adds a 'ssh_keypair_name' option to the configuration for AWS, along with some munging to create the temporarily keypair if one isn't specific. NOT YET WORKING.

14706,GH 1508 - Ensure Packer VMX is updated and saved,"We need to ensure the VMWare process has exited before attempting to run VMX file cleanup steps, otherwise VMWare may overwrite our changes. While Packer does its best to ensure VMWare has exited, there's still a race condition on some OSs between VMWare flushing the VMX and Packer updating it. The workaround is to artifically wait 5 seconds. When using the VMX builder its possible for the source machine to have a floppy and/or CD-ROM mounted which gets cloned to the new VM Packer spins up, but have no Packer configuration for those devices. With this change we always attempt to remove the mounted devices regardless of the Packer configuration."
14707,Update vagrant supported builder list,Update the list of supported builders in the vagrant post-processor docs to include QEMU.
14708,Add support for vagrant with qemu,"Once we have produced a qemu VM, we now have the option of using the vagrant post-processor to create a .box file that can be used with the vagrant-libvirt plugin. This uses the new State method of the Artifact API to get necessary information from the builder."
14709,Expand Artifact API to expose build state,In order that something consuming an artifact can have access to extra builder specific data add the State method which allows the caller to ask for arbitary values by name.

14720,Clean VMX step should always remove floppy.,"When using the VMX builder its possible for the source machine to have a floppy configured which gets cloned to the new VM Packer spins up. When the new VM's Packer config doesn't have a floppy_files config entry, the Packer clean VMX step fails to remove the floppy disk from the new VM. This can cause build failures, for example with the vsphere post processor; generating errors like:  Post-processor failed: Failed: exit status 1 Error: File (/home/teamcity/tmp/buildTmp/packer941120499) could not be found.  Opening the cloned VM's VMX file you can clearly see it has a floppy entry from the source machine's VMX file (exact same path) even though the Packer config contains no floppy_files entry."

14733,scripts: build should do everything now,
14734,Run two builds in parallel with go get.,"By default, go get determines parallelism based on the number of cores available. Those show up as 32 in the Travis CI environment but a virtual machine is limited both by the amount of cores it has allocated and the amount of memory available to it. 32 parallel build processes are likely to exhaust the memory resources, leading to killed processes. This change reduces the number of builds running concurrently to 2, which should reduce the likelihood of memory exhaustion greatly. The number could probably be dialed up a little bit, but this should give a good default reflecting the environment's resources."

15139,Fix chroot builder to work with chef-solo,"According to be5adb92b5c4d5d95e5089be94c706b930fea7ba, the UploadDir method supports two ways of copying depending on whether a trailing slash is used:     src = ""dir""  -> dest/dir     src = ""dir/"" -> dest On BSD-based systems (such as OSX, FreeBSD, etc.) the cp -R command handles these two cases automatically.  However, Linux treats ""src/"" and ""src"" the same. To support the trailing slash syntax portably, we can use:     src = ""dir""   -> dest/dir     src = ""dir/."" -> dest This works on BSD and Linux.  It is better than using wildcards as it grabs hidden files as well. This fixes #1196 that prevents the chef-solo provisioner from working with the chroot builder."

15875,Merge pull request #701 from mitchellh/rpc-refactor,"RPC happens over single TCP connection per plugin now Three benefits: * Single file descriptor per plugin * NAT-friendly since plugins don't have to dial back in to the host * Opens the foundation that we can easily use Unix domain sockets and such A handful of Packer users were having issues with highly parallel (many builder/provisioner) templates where their systems would quickly reach their default file descriptor limits. This was because the previous mechanism would use a single TCP connection per RPC server, and Packer needs many (one per interface, basically).  This merges in a MuxConn that multiplexes many ""streams"" on top of a single io.ReadWriteCloser. The RPC system has been revamped to know about this and use unique stream IDs to send everything over a single connection per plugin. Previously, the RPC mechanism would sometimes send an address to the remote end and expect the remote end to connect back to it. While Packer shouldn't run remotely, some firewalls were having issues. This should be gone. Finally, it should be possible now to optimize and use Unix domain sockets on Unix systems, avoiding ports and firewalls altogether."

However, VirtualBox communicates through simulating raw keyboard input and therefore needs scancodes which are key press/key release sequences. This patch converts backspace, delete and F1-F10 to scancodes. F11 and F12 are not listed in the scancode reference so they have been omitted."
