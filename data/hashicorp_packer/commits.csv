94,hcp: generate fingerprints on each new build,"Fingerprints are how we link a packer build to an iteration on HCP. These are computed automatically from the Git SHA in the current state, and are unique to the bucket/iteration. The main problem with this approach is that while sound in theory, it quickly falls apart when users want to run the same build configuration twice, but expect a new image to be created. With the current model, this fails, as the iteration with the current SHA already exists. While this is solvable through environment variables, or by committing a change to the repository, we think this is not clear enough, and causes an extra step to what should otherwise be a simple process. Therefore, to lower the barrier of entry into HCP, we change this behaviour with this commit. Now, fingerprints are randomly generated ULIDs instead of a git SHA, and a new one is always generated, unless one is already specified in the environment. This makes continuation of an existing iteration a conscious choice rather than something automatic, and virtually eliminates conflicts such as the ones described above.",hcp: generate fingerprints on each new build,"Fingerprints are how we link a packer build to an iteration on HCP.

This automation has been introduced to crt-workflows-common as a new workflow (with the new bob command) and handles version bumping at the end of the release pipeline (after being released to production); for example, 1.0.0→1.0.1 and 1.0.0-dev→1.0.0.

This is made possible by adding the new event “bump-version” in the ci.hcl file in this PR.

147,core: Update validation options for undeclared variables (#12104)," Update validation options for undeclared variables  In an effort to help users move from JSON to HCL2 templates the support for variable definitions files are being updated to ignore undeclared variable warnings on build execution. For legacy JSON templates builds no warnings are displayed when var-files contain undeclared variables. Since preferred mode HCL2 templates is to be explicit with variable declarations - they must be declared to be used - validation for undeclared variables still warns when running packer validate. A new flag has been added to the validate command that can be used to disable undeclared variable warnings.  Update validation test for unused variables  Example Run ``` ~>  go run . validate -no-warn-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl The configuration is valid. ~>  go run . validate -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable. To declare variable ""unused"" place this block in one of your .pkr.hcl files, such as variables.pkr.hcl variable ""unused"" {   type    = string   default = null } The configuration is valid. ~>  go run . build -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl file.chocolate: output will be in this color.

To mitigate against potential overloading of this field it is being renamed to be more explicit on its usage.  command/build: Add warn-on-undeclared-var flag  Now that the default behaviour is to not display warnings for undeclared variables an optional flag has been added to toggle the old behaviour. ``` ~>  go run . build -warn-on-undeclared-var -var-file command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/undeclared.pkrvars.hcl command/test-fixtures/validate/var-file-tests/basic.pkr.hcl Warning: Undefined variable The variable ""unused"" was set but was not declared as an input variable.

The builds are registered to HCP with the source.String() function however, which does not contain the build's name. This prevents any build containing a name to work, as their name/source.String does not match. The name we registered the build with is stored in a CoreBuild as the Type attribute, but cannot be safely accessed, as builds are types within the command as packersdk.Build, which only exposes Name() for this purpose.

920,Update error messaging to bypass panicwrap only on non-recoverable,"errors While working on this change it was found that prefixing an error message with the ErrorPrefix string would trigger a copyOutput function that would copy any outputted string to Stderr, until a new ErrorPrefix or Outprefix string is encountered in the output. During background runs of Packer an error message with the ErrorPrefix was being outputted which was causing all output, including Stdout, to be written to Stderr. This change updates the logic to only override the Stdout logging for non-recoverable errors. The idea being that any non-recoverable error should bypass panicwrap so that user know an error occurred. All other errors should follow the same behavior that we had prior to Packer v1.7.1.

1393,QEMU: Minor fix to VNC mapping parameters and output,"  Set the QEMU builder vnc_port_min to have a minimum value of 5900,   with updated documentation to explain why.   Changed output messages so that the correct port is listed in packer's   messaging to the user.   LONGER DESCRIPTION If vnc_min_port is set to anything above 5900, then packer will fail to connect via VNC to the QEMU instance. This is due to how QEMU parses the port for listening to VNC: host:d                TCP connections will only be allowed from host on                display d.  By convention the TCP port is 5900+d. Previously the calculation for the port was vncPort - VNCPortMin, however this will result in an incorrect port being displayed in packer's messages and potentially packer being unable to connect via VNC to the host. For example if vnc_port_min=5990 nad vnc_port_max=5999: Looking for available port between 5990 and 5999 on 0.0.0.0 Found available port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 Found available VNC port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 [....] ==> Starting VM, booting disk image      view the screen of the VM, connect via VNC without a password to      vnc://0.0.0.0:6 This will cause QEMU to set the listening port to 5906 while packer's VNC client is attempting to connect to 5996. I am a touch concerned as this commit undoes pull request #9905 (specfically commit 7335695c), but I am also confused as to how he was able to get QEMU to get a VNC listening port below 5900, as examining QEMU's git history has shown that this behavior has been in since at least 2017, probably older. Hopefully the more explicit error messaging and documentation can make it clear why this is being undone.",QEMU: Minor fix to VNC mapping parameters and output,"Set the QEMU builder vnc_port_min to have a minimum value of 5900,   with updated documentation to explain why.

1673,Add packer fmt command (#10225), Add packer fmt command  This change adds a new command that allows users to format one or more HCL2 Packer configuration template files. Related to: #9174  command/fmt: Add check flag  Packer's fmt command now supports a check flag that will output the name of any file that would be changed by the HCL2 formatting engine. The check flag is mutually exclusive with the write flag and will only check if formatting is needed. The update write flag will now overwrite the source files with the newly formatted HCL2 source unless the -write=false or -check is passed at the command line.  Returns a diagnostic error if Format is unable to show a diff - equivalent to terraform fmt Updates testing to run against #Format and not the private methods of the HCL2Formatter; fixes ShowDiff test failure on Windows  Updates comments for exported functions   Add docs for fmt command ,Add packer fmt command (#10225),Add packer fmt command This change adds a new command that allows users to format one or more HCL2 Packer configuration template files.

This is useful when the VM and or the machine executing Packer has multiple interfaces. Until now Packer would accept the first non-loopback IP as the .HTTPIP and VMIP.

2703,HCL2 only: Make provisioners and post-processors reprepare themselves with build data (#9534),"9444 allows to share builder infos with provisioners and post-processor by re-starting new provisioners and post-processors once the build has started; #9490 allows to 'excpect/only' on a full build blocks (after naming a block), merged together, the tests of #9490 fail. This means we would have to reimplement the only/except logic. While this could have worked, re-using the already started provisioners and post-processor for HCL2 is better/simpler IMO as we won't have to maintain a feature parity. Also with HCL2 and go-cty all struct ( here provisioner/post-processor) fields are set at the moment of configuring so we should not get weird 'default value' behaviour issue. This PR reverts some parts of #9444 and implement #9444 in a different manner: I created specific HCL2Provisioner and HCL2PostProcessor structs that both re-prepare themselves right before provisioning.

3388,fix builds on linux (#9031),"  fix builds on linux   Build: Move to CGO_ENABLED=0 (#9057)   After further investigation on cross-compiling Go bins on Linux. I found that statically linking against GCC (for libc) failed to build for ARM and introduced a possible licensing issue as our bins would essentially be bundling libc into the bin. Diving further into cross compiling on Linux I found that the defacto solution is to compile with CGO disabled - this was also found to be the case for other HashiCorp products. Disabling CGO has the limitation of not allowing the use of any pkg that calls out to C (net, os), but in looking into the Packer code base and the relevant Go code base it appears that the latest versions of Go have pure Go implementations of the said packages so I believe we are good to go. I should also point out that CGO is disabled by default when cross compiling via go build. However, the GOX tool will enable it if it is not explicitly disabled. Below are three test cases executed to validate the compile bins work as expected. Build results after change ``` ⇶  make bin WARN: 'make bin' is for debug / test builds only.

3733,hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables (#8834)," hcl2template/types.variables: Update logic for parsing literal value variables  In running tests via the CLI it was determined that when using the variable block with no explicit type assigned the type of the default value was not being set within the map. This change updates the decodeConfig method so that a type is always set for any defined variable if not specified. The second change is to properly handle the evaluation of basic variable types (e.g String, Number, Bool). Previously variables defined on the CLI or via PKR_VAR required some additional quoting to for proper evaluation. This change fixes that issue so that it works like it does in Terraform :) Build results before the change ``` ⇶  PKR_VAR_example='[""one"",""two""]' ~/bin/packer build -var 'foo=home' .

4158,build using HCL2 (#8423),"This follows #8232 which added the code to generate the code required to parse HCL files for each packer component. All old config files of packer will keep on working the same. Packer takes one argument. When a directory is passed, all files in the folder with a name ending with  “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” will be parsed using the HCL2 format. When a file ending with “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” is passed it will be parsed using the HCL2 format. For every other case; the old packer style will be used. 1. the hcl2template pkg can create a packer.Build from a set of HCL (v2) files I had to make the packer.coreBuild (which is our one and only packer.Build ) a public struct with public fields 2. Components interfaces get a new ConfigSpec Method to read a file from an HCL file. This is a breaking change for packer plugins. a packer component can be a: builder/provisioner/post-processor each component interface now gets a ConfigSpec() hcldec.ObjectSpec which allows packer to tell what is the layout of the hcl2 config meant to configure that specific component. This ObjectSpec is sent through the wire (RPC) and a cty.Value is now sent through the already existing configuration entrypoints: Provisioner.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) error  Builder.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) ([]string, error)  PostProcessor.Configure(raws ...interface{}) error close #1768 Example hcl files: ```hcl // file amazon-ebs-kms-key/run.pkr.hcl build {     sources = [         ""source.amazon-ebs.first"",     ] provisioner ""shell"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  post-processor ""shell-local"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] }  } // amazon-ebs-kms-key/source.pkr.hcl source ""amazon-ebs"" ""first"" { ami_name = ""hcl2-test"" region = ""us-east-1"" instance_type = ""t2.micro""  kms_key_id = ""c729958f-c6ba-44cd-ab39-35ab68ce0a6c"" encrypt_boot = true source_ami_filter {     filters {       virtualization-type = ""hvm""       name =  ""amzn-ami-hvm-????.??.?.????????-x86_64-gp2""       root-device-type = ""ebs""     }     most_recent = true     owners = [""amazon""] } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvda""     volume_size = 20     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = ""true"" } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvdf""     volume_size = 500     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = true     encrypted = true }  ami_regions = [""eu-central-1""] run_tags {     Name = ""packer-solr-something""     stack-name = ""DevOps Tools"" }  communicator = ""ssh"" ssh_pty = true ssh_username = ""ec2-user"" associate_public_ip_address = true  } ```",build using HCL2 (#8423),"This follows #8232 which added the code to generate the code required to parse HCL files for each packer component.

For every other case; the old packer style will be used. 1. the hcl2template pkg can create a packer.Build from a set of HCL (v2) files I had to make the packer.coreBuild (which is our one and only packer.Build ) a public struct with public fields 2. Components interfaces get a new ConfigSpec Method to read a file from an HCL file. This is a breaking change for packer plugins. a packer component can be a: builder/provisioner/post-processor each component interface now gets a ConfigSpec() hcldec.ObjectSpec which allows packer to tell what is the layout of the hcl2 config meant to configure that specific component. This ObjectSpec is sent through the wire (RPC) and a cty.Value is now sent through the already existing configuration entrypoints: Provisioner.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) error  Builder.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) ([]string, error)  PostProcessor.Configure(raws ...interface{}) error close #1768 Example hcl files: ```hcl // file amazon-ebs-kms-key/run.pkr.hcl build {     sources = [         ""source.amazon-ebs.first"",     ] provisioner ""shell"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] } post-processor ""shell-local"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] } } // amazon-ebs-kms-key/source.pkr.hcl source ""amazon-ebs"" ""first"" { ami_name = ""hcl2-test"" region = ""us-east-1"" instance_type = ""t2.micro"" kms_key_id = ""c729958f-c6ba-44cd-ab39-35ab68ce0a6c"" encrypt_boot = true source_ami_filter {     filters {       virtualization-type = ""hvm""       name =  ""amzn-ami-hvm-????.??.?.????????-x86_64-gp2""       root-device-type = ""ebs""     }     most_recent = true     owners = [""amazon""] } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvda""     volume_size = 20     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = ""true"" } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvdf""     volume_size = 500     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = true     encrypted = true } ami_regions = [""eu-central-1""] run_tags {     Name = ""packer-solr-something""     stack-name = ""DevOps Tools"" } communicator = ""ssh"" ssh_pty = true ssh_username = ""ec2-user"" associate_public_ip_address = true } ```"

If a user wishes to house the build files on a separate disk from the output directory (perhaps for performance reasons or due to disk space limitations) they can still do so through the use of temp_path.,Remove the option to place the VHD files in a separate directory,The export process now exports the VM directly from the build directory into the output directory.

7785,Ensure the export directory structure matches that of previous versions,"Commit 3fc2defb6 altered the directory structure associated with an exported VM. The changes mean that the export process now stores the exported machine files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output directory. This commit restores the previous behaviour whereby the exported machine files and folders were stored directly in the output directory. This allows us to keep the efficiency improvements introduced with 3fc2defb6 while maintaining backward compatibility. By default the Export-VM command creates three folders in the specified export directory - 'Virtual Hard Disks', 'Virtual Machines' and 'Snapshots'. When a machine with no associated snapshots is exported the 'Snapshots' directory is empty. Prior to 3fc2defb6 the Snapshots folder was not copied/incorporated into the output directory at all. This was a bug. This commit preserves the legacy behaviour by not including an empty Snapshots directory in the export. However, if there are Snapshots associated with the VM, they are now moved into the output directory along with the usual directories containing disks and VM metadata. This prevents warnings/errors on import due to missing snapshots.",Ensure the export directory structure matches that of previous versions,"Commit 3fc2defb6 altered the directory structure associated with an exported VM.

7787,Refactor the export step for Hyper-V ISO and VMCX builders, Fixes a bug that caused the build to error if users did not   explicitly set skip_compaction:true when setting skip_export:   true. See #6392. Improves the efficiency of the compaction and export process by   reordering the compaction and export steps. Further improves the efficiency of the compacting step through   compacting the vmd* file directly rather than creating and then   operating on a copy. The changes mean the export process now stores the exported machine   files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output   directory.

Dot sourcing the env vars in this way avoids the need to embed them   directly in the command string. This avoids the need to escape the env   vars to ensure the command string is correctly parsed. Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS. The std and elevated PS commands now inject env vars into the remote   env via the same mechanism. This ensures consistent behaviour across the   two command types.

9299,Azure: Don't provide location for build_resource_group_name,Location is required by default because you must specify where to create the resource group containing the packer resources. When using build_resource_group_name you are specifying that packer should use an existing resource group and so the location that resources are in can be determined by fetching the information from the existing group. It is forbidden to pass both variables as it is easier and more intuitive that the location comes from the group rather than ignore a parameter.

Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS.

This ensures correct   parsing once the command is wrapped within the elevatedTemplates XML   based Task Scheduler definition. Fixes #4322"

9882,Remove LGPL dependencies,"This changeset performs the following:  Updates masterzen/winrm vendor to include change from (https://github.com/masterzen/winrm/pull/73). Removes masterzen/xmlpath dependency, as it is licensed under the LGPL license. Updates dylanmei/winrmtest vendor to include change from (https://github.com/dylanmei/winrmtest/pull/4). Updates packer-community/winrmcp vendor to include the removal of the masterzen/winrm/winrm sub-class as a result of the winrm CLI tool being removed from the masterzen/winrm repository. Updates nested dependencies as a result of the above vendor changes. Refactors parallels/driver_9 to use goxpath instead of xmlpath, as xmlpath is licensed under LGPL. Adds a basic unit test for the refactor work in parallels/driver_9 to confirm functionality.

Removes masterzen/xmlpath dependency, as it is licensed under the LGPL license. Updates dylanmei/winrmtest vendor to include change from (link). Updates packer-community/winrmcp vendor to include the removal of the masterzen/winrm/winrm sub-class as a result of the winrm CLI tool being removed from the masterzen/winrm repository. Updates nested dependencies as a result of the above vendor changes. Refactors parallels/driver_9 to use goxpath instead of xmlpath, as xmlpath is licensed under LGPL. Adds a basic unit test for the refactor work in parallels/driver_9 to confirm functionality.

9940,Update puppet-masterless commands to be OS specific,"Previous implementation hardcoded ""mkdir -p"" which is fine for Unix, but fails on Windows. This change draws on the example in the chef-solo provisioner on how to detect the OS in use and use an appropriate mkdir command. In addition to updating the mkdir command, the actual executeCommand needs to be OS specific, since Windows doesn't have sudo and Unix doesn't require 'SET' when trying to change the value of a variable. Modify the actual Windows command used to run Puppet. Since the Facter vars on Windows are set with 'SET =', a '&&' is needed between the SET commands and the actual Puppet invocation.",Update puppet-masterless commands to be OS specific,"Previous implementation hardcoded ""mkdir -p"" which is fine for Unix, but fails on Windows.

This is useful when building Vagrant boxes, since Vagrant now produces output such as: ``` WARNING: The VMX file for this box contains a setting that is automatically overwritten by Vagrant when started. Vagrant will stop overwriting this setting in an upcoming release which may pre vent proper networking setup.

Added Retry method to googlecompute package. Added GetSerialPortOutput to googlecompute Drivers. Added StepWaitInstanceStartup (and associated test) which waits for an instance startup-script to finish. Changed the instance service account to use the same service account as the one provided in the Packer config template. It was the project default service account. Tested googlecompute package with 'go test' and also performed builds with a startup script and without a startup script.,Adding support for googlecompute startup scripts.,- Startup scripts can be provided through the instance creation metadata field 'startup-script'. - Script log can be copied to a GCS location by setting the metadata field 'startup-script-log-dest'.
