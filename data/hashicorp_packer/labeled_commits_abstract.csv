In that change the ldflags for striping debug symbols was removed resulting in binaries with full debug symbols. Thus resulting in larger binary deliverables.

73,Fix typo in platform docs,0.42784923,    specific bug fixes and improvements.,"Fingerprints are how we link a packer build to an iteration on HCP. These are computed automatically from the Git SHA in the current state, and are unique to the bucket/iteration. The main problem with this approach is that while sound in theory, it quickly falls apart when users want to run the same build configuration twice, but expect a new image to be created. With the current model, this fails, as the iteration with the current SHA already exists. While this is solvable through environment variables, or by committing a change to the repository, we think this is not clear enough, and causes an extra step to what should otherwise be a simple process. Therefore, to lower the barrier of entry into HCP, we change this behaviour with this commit. Now, fingerprints are randomly generated ULIDs instead of a git SHA, and a new one is always generated, unless one is already specified in the environment. This makes continuation of an existing iteration a conscious choice rather than something automatic, and virtually eliminates conflicts such as the ones described above.",0

This automation has been introduced to crt-workflows-common as a new workflow (with the new bob command) and handles version bumping at the end of the release pipeline (after being released to production); for example, 1.0.0→1.0.1 and 1.0.0-dev→1.0.0. Bumping the minor version (ie 1.0.x→1.1.0) is only supported manually via bob update version -bump minor, but not supported in CRT (this work is upcoming). This is made possible by adding the new event “bump-version” in the ci.hcl file in this PR. What this small action does: Allows for the static version string from the version/VERSION file to be read by the new CRT workflow and automagically be bumped to the next version (whether it be a minor, or patch, or major version bump). Outputs an error if there’s no VERSION file in the version dir Outputs an error if there’s no version string in the VERSION file Is able to parse product_version if it is 1.3.0-alpha1 as 1.3.0 (example: when product_version = 1.3.0-alpha1, base_version = 1.3.0) Is able to parse prerelease product versions such as alpha1 (example prerelease_product_version = alpha1) in the statement above.",0

This works out-of-the-box for JSON templates, as the build's name is always the builder's, so there's no confusion on that. For HCP templates however, there's a possibility for a template to define a name for the build, which is returned by a CoreBuild's Name() function, in addition to the source's Type/Name. The builds are registered to HCP with the source.String() function however, which does not contain the build's name. This prevents any build containing a name to work, as their name/source.String does not match. The name we registered the build with is stored in a CoreBuild as the Type attribute, but cannot be safely accessed, as builds are types within the command as packersdk.Build, which only exposes Name() for this purpose.

This documentation focuses more on the use of environment variables for configuring Packer for HCP Packer, which is necessary for legacy JSON template users looking to publish to HCP Packer. In light of the new HCP Packer documentation page we've opted for a shorter version of the HCP Packer introduction section. Applying the first round of suggestions to tighten up the documentation.

Now, this environment variable defaults to not explicitely enable, but instead to explicitely disable HCP integration, and the feature switch fall upon HCP_PACKER_BUCKET_NAME.

This would cause a bug in which once a build reached the post-processing state, and its cloud-provider was set, the status could not be updated anymore, as the cloud-provider would be set and further updates are rejected by the platform.

During background runs of Packer an error message with the ErrorPrefix was being outputted which was causing all output, including Stdout, to be written to Stderr. This change updates the logic to only override the Stdout logging for non-recoverable errors. The idea being that any non-recoverable error should bypass panicwrap so that user know an error occurred. All other errors should follow the same behavior that we had prior to Packer v1.7.1.

This is due to how QEMU parses the port for listening to VNC: host:d                TCP connections will only be allowed from host on                display d.  By convention the TCP port is 5900+d. Previously the calculation for the port was vncPort - VNCPortMin, however this will result in an incorrect port being displayed in packer's messages and potentially packer being unable to connect via VNC to the host. For example if vnc_port_min=5990 nad vnc_port_max=5999: Looking for available port between 5990 and 5999 on 0.0.0.0 Found available port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 Found available VNC port: 5996 on IP: 0.0.0.0 [....] ==> Starting VM, booting disk image      view the screen of the VM, connect via VNC without a password to      vnc://0.0.0.0:6 This will cause QEMU to set the listening port to 5906 while packer's VNC client is attempting to connect to 5996. I am a touch concerned as this commit undoes pull request #9905 (specfically commit 7335695c), but I am also confused as to how he was able to get QEMU to get a VNC listening port below 5900, as examining QEMU's git history has shown that this behavior has been in since at least 2017, probably older. Hopefully the more explicit error messaging and documentation can make it clear why this is being undone.",0

Related to: #9174 command/fmt: Add check flag Packer's fmt command now supports a check flag that will output the name of any file that would be changed by the HCL2 formatting engine. The check flag is mutually exclusive with the write flag and will only check if formatting is needed. The update write flag will now overwrite the source files with the newly formatted HCL2 source unless the -write=false or -check is passed at the command line. Returns a diagnostic error if Format is unable to show a diff - equivalent to terraform fmt Updates testing to run against #Format and not the private methods of the HCL2Formatter; fixes ShowDiff test failure on Windows Updates comments for exported functions Add docs for fmt command,0

In both cases, CPUs gives you virtual cores, not sockets. For example, I want 6 cores per socket across 2 sockets for 12 total cores. Based on the wording of this doc, I set CPUs to 2 and cpu_cores to 6. The documentation implies that will give me 2 sockets with 6 cores each. The actual behavior is you get 2 cores, and when you crack open the VMs configuration, you see that cores per socket is set to 6 -- which is meaningless. Setting CPUs to 12 and cpu_cores to 6 gives me what I wanted. So the wording I propose is  - module (int32) - Number of CPU cores.",0

This starts a validated Packer core and from that core we generate an HCL 'block' per plugin/configuration. So for a builder, a provisioner, a post-processor or a variable. The contents of each block is just transformed as is and basically all fields are HCL2-ified. A generated field can be valid in JSON but invalid on HCL2; for example JSON templating (in mapstructure) allows to set arrays of strings - like x = [""a"", ""b""] - with single strings - like x=""a"" -, HCL does not allow this. Since JSON does not make the distinction between variables and locals, everything will be a variable. So variables that use other variables will not work. hcl2_upgrade tries to transform go templating interpolation calls to HCL2 calls when possible, leaving the go templating calls like they are in case it cannot.

This means we would have to reimplement the only/except logic. While this could have worked, re-using the already started provisioners and post-processor for HCL2 is better/simpler IMO as we won't have to maintain a feature parity. Also with HCL2 and go-cty all struct ( here provisioner/post-processor) fields are set at the moment of configuring so we should not get weird 'default value' behaviour issue. This PR reverts some parts of #9444 and implement #9444 in a different manner: I created specific HCL2Provisioner and HCL2PostProcessor structs that both re-prepare themselves right before provisioning. I think this makes the code a little simpler and lays a nice ground for improvement.",1

GH-11317,"fix builds on linux Build: Move to CGO_ENABLED=0 (#9057) After further investigation on cross-compiling Go bins on Linux. I found that statically linking against GCC (for libc) failed to build for ARM and introduced a possible licensing issue as our bins would essentially be bundling libc into the bin. Diving further into cross compiling on Linux I found that the defacto solution is to compile with CGO disabled - this was also found to be the case for other HashiCorp products. Disabling CGO has the limitation of not allowing the use of any pkg that calls out to C (net, os), but in looking into the Packer code base and the relevant Go code base it appears that the latest versions of Go have pure Go implementations of the said packages so I believe we are good to go. I should also point out that CGO is disabled by default when cross compiling via go build. However, the GOX tool will enable it if it is not explicitly disabled. Below are three test cases executed to validate the compile bins work as expected.

This change updates the decodeConfig method so that a type is always set for any defined variable if not specified. The second change is to properly handle the evaluation of basic variable types (e.g String, Number, Bool). Previously variables defined on the CLI or via PKR_VAR required some additional quoting to for proper evaluation. This change fixes that issue so that it works like it does in Terraform :) Build results before the change module Build results after the change module tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update test to use Bool Turns out a string value won't actually complain if it's given a non string looking value. It will just covert the value to a string literal so using a type Bool which should fail if given anything that is not true or false. tests/hcl2template/types.variables: Update unit tests During testing it was found that by default the variable stanza were defaulting to a cty.NilType, and not the Type of it's default value.

4137,website: downloads page,0.542604,    available under ./release/docker/README.md.,"This follows #8232 which added the code to generate the code required to parse HCL files for each packer component. All old config files of packer will keep on working the same. Packer takes one argument. When a directory is passed, all files in the folder with a name ending with  “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” will be parsed using the HCL2 format. When a file ending with “.pkr.hcl” or “.pkr.json” is passed it will be parsed using the HCL2 format. For every other case; the old packer style will be used. 1. the hcl2template pkg can create a packer.Build from a set of HCL (v2) files I had to make the packer.coreBuild (which is our one and only packer.Build ) a public struct with public fields 2. Components interfaces get a new ConfigSpec Method to read a file from an HCL file. This is a breaking change for packer plugins. a packer component can be a: builder/provisioner/post-processor each component interface now gets a ConfigSpec() hcldec.ObjectSpec which allows packer to tell what is the layout of the hcl2 config meant to configure that specific component. This ObjectSpec is sent through the wire (RPC) and a cty.Value is now sent through the already existing configuration entrypoints: Provisioner.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) error  Builder.Prepare(raws ...interface{}) ([]string, error)  PostProcessor.Configure(raws ...interface{}) error close #1768 Example hcl files: ```hcl // file amazon-ebs-kms-key/run.pkr.hcl build {     sources = [         ""source.amazon-ebs.first"",     ] provisioner ""shell"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] } post-processor ""shell-local"" {     inline = [         ""sleep 5""     ] } } // amazon-ebs-kms-key/source.pkr.hcl source ""amazon-ebs"" ""first"" { ami_name = ""hcl2-test"" region = ""us-east-1"" instance_type = ""t2.micro"" kms_key_id = ""c729958f-c6ba-44cd-ab39-35ab68ce0a6c"" encrypt_boot = true source_ami_filter {     filters {       virtualization-type = ""hvm""       name =  ""amzn-ami-hvm-????.??.?.????????-x86_64-gp2""       root-device-type = ""ebs""     }     most_recent = true     owners = [""amazon""] } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvda""     volume_size = 20     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = ""true"" } launch_block_device_mappings {     device_name = ""/dev/xvdf""     volume_size = 500     volume_type = ""gp2""     delete_on_termination = true     encrypted = true } ami_regions = [""eu-central-1""] run_tags {     Name = ""packer-solr-something""     stack-name = ""DevOps Tools"" } communicator = ""ssh"" ssh_pty = true ssh_username = ""ec2-user"" associate_public_ip_address = true } ```",0

Packer heavily uses the mapstructure decoding library to load/parse user config files. Packer now needs to move to HCL2. Here are a few differences/gaps betweens hcl2 and mapstructure: in HCL2 all basic struct fields (string/int/struct) that are not pointers   are required ( must be set ). In mapstructure everything is optional. mapstructure allows to 'squash' fields  (ex: Field CommonStructType mapstructure:"",squash"") this allows to  decorate structs and reuse configuration code. HCL2 parsing libs don't have  anything similar. mapstructure-to-hcl2 will parse Packer's config files and generate the HCL2 compliant code that will allow to not change any of the current builders in order to move to HCL2 to softly move to HCL2.",0

So it's time for a new middleman-hashicorp version. As with last time, here's a reminder for the next person who needs to update this: Packer is different from all the other product sites. It uses a Netlify   container to build, instead of either the basic middleman-hashicorp container   or the hybrid thing that Vault uses. It doesn't come with all batteries   included, so it has to take fifteen minutes to build the universe the first   time you run it (or the first time you run it after an upgrade). After that,   it caches all the gems it built the previous time. So the steps to update it are a bit different. (Simpler, but more sitting around.)

The changes mean that the export process now stores the exported machine files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output directory. This commit restores the previous behaviour whereby the exported machine files and folders were stored directly in the output directory. This allows us to keep the efficiency improvements introduced with 3fc2defb6 while maintaining backward compatibility. By default the Export-VM command creates three folders in the specified export directory - 'Virtual Hard Disks', 'Virtual Machines' and 'Snapshots'. When a machine with no associated snapshots is exported the 'Snapshots' directory is empty. Prior to 3fc2defb6 the Snapshots folder was not copied/incorporated into the output directory at all. This was a bug. This commit preserves the legacy behaviour by not including an empty Snapshots directory in the export. However, if there are Snapshots associated with the VM, they are now moved into the output directory along with the usual directories containing disks and VM metadata. This prevents warnings/errors on import due to missing snapshots.",0

Further improves the efficiency of the compacting step through   compacting the vmd* file directly rather than creating and then   operating on a copy. The changes mean the export process now stores the exported machine   files and folders under a folder with name 'vm_name' in the output   directory.

By default, in order to inject the required environment variables, the file is 'dot sourced' by the 'execute_command' using the {{ .Vars }} variable. Unfortunately the inclusion of the dollar in the path caused issues for users connecting over ssh as the (typically bash) shell running the execute command would try and interpret the dollar sign. The change allows users to specify the location the file is uploaded to, thereby allowing the user to specify a custom 'execute_command' that escapes any dollar signs that could be present in the path.

9278,adding tests,0.4812855,    checksums. GH-11495,Location is required by default because you must specify where to create the resource group containing the packer resources. When using build_resource_group_name you are specifying that packer should use an existing resource group and so the location that resources are in can be determined by fetching the information from the existing group. It is forbidden to pass both variables as it is easier and more intuitive that the location comes from the group rather than ignore a parameter. Closes: #5655,0

As an alternative, maintainers can continue to use the packer-plugin-check by pinning the command to Packer 1.7.10.  GH-11317","This commit rewrites the Vagrantfile for Packer in a similar manner to the work done for Nomad (hashicorp/nomad#3175) in order to make cross-platform development easier. It also adds support for a FreeBSD base box. Provisioning scripts are separated out in order that they can be correctly linted. Each script is prefixed vagrant, then the operating system, then whether or not it expects to be run in a privileged shell.

Dot sourcing the env vars in this way avoids the need to embed them   directly in the command string. This avoids the need to escape the env   vars to ensure the command string is correctly parsed. Characters within the env vars that are special to PS (such as $'s   and backticks) will still need to be escaped to allow them to be   correctly interpreted by PS. The std and elevated PS commands now inject env vars into the remote   env via the same mechanism. This ensures consistent behaviour across the   two command types. Fixes #5471",0

When executed the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command configures the   firewall to allow management messages to be sent over HTTP (port 5985) This undoes the previous command in the script that configured the   firewall to prevent this access. The upshot is that the system is configured and ready to accept WinRM   connections earlier than intended. If Packer establishes its WinRM connection immediately after execution   of the 'winrm quickconfig -q' command, the later commands within the   script that restart the WinRM service cause the established   connection, and consequently, the overall build to fail.",0

However, Linux treats ""src/"" and ""src"" the same. To support the trailing slash syntax portably, we can use:     src = ""dir""   -> dest/dir     src = ""dir/."" -> dest This works on BSD and Linux.  It is better than using wildcards as it grabs hidden files as well. This fixes #1196 that prevents the chef-solo provisioner from working with the chroot builder.",0

This was because the previous mechanism would use a single TCP connection per RPC server, and Packer needs many (one per interface, basically).  This merges in a MuxConn that multiplexes many ""streams"" on top of a single io.ReadWriteCloser. The RPC system has been revamped to know about this and use unique stream IDs to send everything over a single connection per plugin. Previously, the RPC mechanism would sometimes send an address to the remote end and expect the remote end to connect back to it. While Packer shouldn't run remotely, some firewalls were having issues. This should be gone. Finally, it should be possible now to optimize and use Unix domain sockets on Unix systems, avoiding ports and firewalls altogether.",0
