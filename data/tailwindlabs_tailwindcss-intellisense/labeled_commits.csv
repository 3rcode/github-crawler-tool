Define TypeScript compiler target (#522),0.6551765,Add typescript to default languages (#690),"TypeScript was complaining about some syntax features, this solves it. It doesn’t affect the output, as tsdx ignores the target property.",0
Optimize language service build (#520),0.4396857,Boot language servers for nested workspace folders (#642),"tsdx uses .browserslistrc to determine how to transpile the source code. By default it supports very old environments. By specifying relatively modern targets, the bundle size has been reduced with ~40%. This also significantly increases performance and readability of the output, because babel’s regenerator runtime isn’t used anymore. The output target can’t be set to something too new, because tsdx uses an older version of terser which isn’t compatible with all new syntax (e.g. optional chaining).",0
Convert dlv require statements to imports (#521),0.44225705,Support exports fields when resolving dependencies (#412),"It was already imported in one place, that appears to work fine. Using require results in invalid ESM output, because require is not defined in ES modules.",0
