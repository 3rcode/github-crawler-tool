66,"It's been a long time coming (sorry!) but the extension has had a bit of a restructure, which has fixed some bugs, enabled some new features, and laid the groundwork for some really cool upcoming features.
I'm dropping an initial pre-release here for brave people to try out, and I will be looking to release a new version of the extension after a bit more testing. To install go to the Extensions panel in VS Code and click on the ""three-dot"" button. From there, select Install from VSIX... and select the vscode-tailwindcss-0.3.0-alpha.1.vsix file
I appreciate anyone taking the time to try this out and provide feedback. I have a bit more free time at the moment to spend on the extension, and I want to make it as good as it can be!

Please be aware that as usual the extension will only activate if you have a Tailwind config file (**/{tailwind,tailwind.config,tailwind-config,.tailwindrc}.js) somewhere in your workspace and have the tailwindcss package installed

General

Added support for string values in Tailwind's important option (#96)
Removed all unnecessary logs (#91)
Added support for components in addition to utilities (#67)
Added CSS syntax highlighting in .vue files (#15)
Added liquid, aspnetcorerazor, and hbs languages
Added description to custom variant completion items where possible
Config parsing errors are now displayed in the VS Code UI

CSS

Added theme (and config) helper hovers
Added @apply class name hovers
Added directive completion items with links to documentation
Added @tailwind completion items (preflight/base, utilities, components, screens) with links to documentation
Fixed @screen completion item order
Helper completion items that contain the . character will now insert square brackets when selected

JSX

Completions now trigger when using backticks (#50, #93):
  js
  const App = () => <div className={`_
