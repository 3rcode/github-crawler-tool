Silently failing DDP syncing when initializing Metric with jsonargparse (#1651),0.51760286,Metrics passed as dict to MetricCollection will now always be in deterministic order (#173)," Broken ddp syncing when initializing metric with jsonargparse (LightningCLI)  This happens due the following combination of factors. - jsonargparse has a docstring parsing function enabled when installed with pip install jsonargparse[signatures] - torchmetrics.Metric has a docstring that mentions an optionaldistributed_available_fn - If distributed_available_fn is not set in **kwargs, Metric.__init__ sets a default pytorch function which enables ddp syncing of metrics\ - When a metric is initialized in a yaml config, jsonargparse recognizes the distributed_available_fn field in the docstring and passes a default value of distributed_available_fn=None  - Hence, any subclass of Metric initialized by jsonargparse has distributed_available_fn = None. These metrics silently fail to sync across gpus.  Co-authored-by: Nicki Skafte Detlefsen skaftenicki@gmail.com Co-authored-by: mergify[bot] 37929162+mergify[bot]@users.noreply.github.com",0

Update docs on the compute groups feature in metric collection (#1237),0.65040237,"Common wisdom dictates that you should never evaluate the performance of your models using only a single metric but instead a collection of metrics. For example, it is common to simultaneously evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score in classification. In TorchMetrics, we have for a long time provided the MetricCollection object for chaining such metrics together for an easy interface to calculate them all at once. However, in many cases, such a collection of metrics shares some of the underlying computations that have been repeated for every metric in the collection. In Torchmetrics v0.8 we have introduced the concept of compute_groups to MetricCollection that will, as default, be auto-detected and group metrics that share some of the same computations.", update docs docs in collection,0

As a consequence, when num_threads>1 and dist_sync_on_step=True is used, the application fails. We, therefore, enforce to automatically setting num_threads=1.  Drop enforcing num_threads=1 and add linkk to repo for generating test results Replace _TRANSFORMERS_AUTO_AVAILABLE with _TRANSFORMERS_AUTO_AVAILABLE everywhere Fix device placement and Set num_threads=0 as default (SkafteNicki's review) Make testing conditional on dependency and connection Skip tests if transformers are not available Mark tests as skip if there's again any connection issue to HF Hub  Co-authored-by: Jirka Borovec Borda@users.noreply.github.com Co-authored-by: Nicki Skafte Detlefsen skaftenicki@gmail.com",0

Fix IoU score for classes not present in target or pred (PL^3098),0.47431022,Removed restriction that preds could not be bigger than num_classes to support logit input (#357)," Fix IoU score for classes not present in target or pred  Fixes #3097  Allow configurable not_present_score for IoU for classes   not present in target or pred. Defaults to 1.0.  Also allow passing num_classes parameter through from iou   metric class down to its underlying functional iou   call.   Changelog: move IoU not-present score fix to [unreleased]   IoU: avoid recomputing class presence in target and pred   Use already-computed support, true positives, and false positives to determine if a class is not present in either target or pred.  Test IoU against sklearn jaccard_score  Also add TODO to test our IoU's not_present_score against sklearn's jaccard_score's zero_division when it beecomes available.  IoU: remove_bg -> ignore_index  Fixes #2736  Rename IoU metric argument from remove_bg -> ignore_index. Accept an optional int class index to ignore, instead of a bool and   instead of always assuming the background class has index 0.  If given, ignore the class index when computing the IoU output,   regardless of reduction method.   Improve documentation for IoU not_present_score   Update default IoU not_present_score to 0.0   Add note about IoU division by zero   Rename IoU not_present_score -> absent_score   Update IoU absent score changelog wording   Condense IoU absent_score argument docstring   Remove unnecessary IoU ignore_index comment   docstrings   isort   flake8   Fix test of IoU against sklearn jaccard   Use macro instead of micro averaging in sklearn's jaccard score, to match multi-class IoU, which conventionally takes per-class scores before averaging.

Class reduction similar to sklearn (PL^3322),0.41909242,"We have for a long time known that there were some underlying problems with how we initially structured the classification package. Essentially, classification tasks can e divided into either binary, multiclass, or multilabel, and determining what task a user is trying to run a given metric on is hard just based on the input. The reason a package such as sklearn can do this is to only support input in very specific formats (no multi-dimensional arrays and no support for both integer and probability/logit formats).",  new class reduce interface   update docs   pep8   update_class_metrics   fix doctest   changelog   fix docs   fix codefactor   fix codefactor   formatting   fix typo   fix typo   typo pr -> per   update from suggestion   fix error   Apply suggestions from code review   Update CHANGELOG.md   formatting   timeouts   docstring formatting for reg metrics   pep   flake8   revert workflow changes   suggestions   Co-authored-by: Nicki Skafte nugginea@gmail.com Co-authored-by: Jirka Borovec Borda@users.noreply.github.com Co-authored-by: Adrian Wälchli aedu.waelchli@gmail.com Co-authored-by: Jirka Borovec jirka@pytorchlightning.ai Co-authored-by: rohitgr7 rohitgr1998@gmail.com,0

Fix average_precision metric (PL^2319),0.51403606,The current implementation of the AveragePrecision and PrecisionRecallCurve has the drawback that it saves all predictions and targets in memory to correctly calculate the metric value. These metrics now receive a binned version that calculates the value at fixed thresholds. This is less precise than original implementations but also much more memory efficient.,"  Fixed average_precision metric, parenthesis were missing.
