94,Updated docs in PrecisionRecallCurve and AveragePrecision (#706),0.7304026,The current implementation of the AveragePrecision and PrecisionRecallCurve has the drawback that it saves all predictions and targets in memory to correctly calculate the metric value. These metrics now receive a binned version that calculates the value at fixed thresholds. This is less precise than original implementations but also much more memory efficient.,,1
95,CI: force testing LTS (#1313),0.47450942,Improved testing speed (#820),"Broken ddp syncing when initializing metric with jsonargparse (LightningCLI) This happens due the following combination of factors. - jsonargparse has a docstring parsing function enabled when installed with pip install jsonargparse[signatures] - torchmetrics.Metric has a docstring that mentions an optionaldistributed_available_fn - If distributed_available_fn is not set in **kwargs, Metric.init sets a default pytorch function which enables ddp syncing of metrics\ - When a metric is initialized in a yaml config, jsonargparse recognizes the distributed_available_fn field in the docstring and passes a default value of distributed_available_fn=None  - Hence, any subclass of Metric initialized by jsonargparse has distributed_available_fn = None. These metrics silently fail to sync across gpus. Co-authored-by: Nicki Skafte Detlefsen skaftenicki@gmail.com Co-authored-by: mergify[bot] 37929162+mergify[bot]@users.noreply.github.com",0
