Add more comprehensive tests,0.4532768,[contributors] Add code coverage support via Coveralls (#257),"This implements the following cases: Basic runs for a specific version/platform/arch with default options   (testing for existence of expected output files/folders) Runs for each target platform with out set Runs for each target platform with asar set Runs for each target platform with prune set Runs for each target platform with ignore set This includes testing ignore including a path separator This also includes testing that ignore entries are applied     with the app folder trimmed Runs for each target platform with overwrite set / not set Runs with all set, with arch or platform each set to all,   and with platform set to multiple platforms (comma-delimited or   array) Tests specifically for the darwin target platform, to test   icon and sign The test logic is organized such that the version of Electron being tested can be configured once centrally (in config.json), and the tests will not run until after downloading any necessary electron versions (to avoid timing out due to long downloads). Resolves #77.",0
Implement multi-target options and refactor code,0.42560893,  compatibility) and optionally takes several of the same sub-parameters as,"This adds support for --all, --platform=all, and --arch=all. In order to accommodate outputting multiple directories for multiple platforms and architectures, this also implements a new directory structure under the output folder (distinguished by both platform and arch).  This structure is applied even to OS X distributions, which formerly were output directly to an .app folder.  This could be considered a backwards-incompatible change. One other backwards-incompatible change is the value that the packager function passes to the callback, which is now always an array of paths, rather than just a single path. The behavior of the icon option has also been modified to use its basename and apply .ico or .icns depending on platform, to make it usable with --all and --platform=all.  This attempts to maximize backwards compatibility, by allowing a full filename to be specified, but replacing the filename's extension with what is appropriate for each target platform.  Alternatively, the extension can now be omitted. In the process of implementing this, it became evident that some things were being done in 3 different places, and weren't always being done consistently, so I've deduplicated everything I could. This also includes a few other changes to improve stability for multi-target runs, and other fixes: Avoid targeting darwin if the environment doesn't support symlinks,   to avoid the process bailing out on Windows Implement --overwrite centrally in index.js such that it explicitly   skips if an output directory already exists, for consistency with   all target platforms and to avoid any possible errors that would halt   operation during one target of a multi-target run Use ncp instead of mv to move to finalPath, which avoids flakiness   I noticed when testing on Windows 8 especially with multi-target runs Simplify temp directory logic by using a nested structure, so there   is only one top-level directory to clean up Reinstate fix from #55 which seems to have been clobbered by a later   merge linux.createApp now resolves to the final output directory;   it was formerly resolving to the executable path mac.createApp now replaces space with underscore in bundle IDs Only the platform modules that are needed are loaded The win32 module only loads rcedit if needed This also fixes a couple of missing updates to docs (readme/usage).
