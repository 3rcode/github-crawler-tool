471,Update golang version to 1.16.4 (#1649),0.92468464,Update golang version to 1.15 (#1474),"While VirtualBox VMs have a means by which to resolve hostnames from the host machine's hosts file, the same is not true of other providers, such as Hyper-V (probably due to greater isolation between host and guest). For example, it's possible to reach (e.g., ping) a hostname defined in the host machine's hosts file immediately after provisioning with VirtualBox (on Windows, at least). But with an otherwise identical configuration in Hyper-V, the hostname cannot be resolved. The primary reason for which I propose this change is that hostname resolution within the VM, for sites defined in Homestead.yaml, is required for Dusk testing. Absent the proposed change, Dusk testing does not work on Hyper-V because homestead.site, for example, cannot be resolved unless 127.0.0.1 homestead.site is added to /etc/hosts.",1

639,Add condition for no ports config,0.64115584,Reduce number of default ports Add old defaults to ports example," Overhaul and update MongoDB installation script  The impetus for this rewrite is that from the initial commit, every php-cli invocation caused PHP to emit a warning. This can be tested/verified as follows: vagrant@homestead:~$ php -r 'echo ""test\n"";' PHP Warning:  Module 'mongodb' already loaded in Unknown on line 0 test  The root-cause turned out to be that the PECL installer was adding extension = mongodb.so to the very top of /etc/php/7.1/cli/php.ini (along with entries for several other extensions, which in itself seems like a bug with the PECL installer). Once I dug into the source, it became clear that the MongoDB driver was being installed only for PHP 7.1, and none of the other (earlier) PHP versions for which support was added recently. The only means by which to install the driver for all PHP versions is to build it from source for each version. This change addresses that need. In any case, the nature of the proposed changes is as follows:   Upgrade MongoDB version from 3.2 to 3.4, and remove --allow-unauthenticated switch from apt-get install command (there should be no reason to use this switch).   Remove sed command that seems designed to modify /usr/bin/pecl directly, which seems like a ""bad idea"". Also, as of this writing, /usr/bin/pecl is untouched after the command is executed, so perhaps the bug it was designed to address has been fixed upstream.   Remove duplicate package names when installing packages required to build MongoDB PECL extension and consolidate into a single apt-get command.   Remove inline systemd init script for MongoDB, as the official package installs its own, and rename references to match common convention (convention is mongod, as in ""Mongo Daemon"", instead of mongodb). Also, remove needless call to systemctl status mongodb, as it produces ""noise"", and fix the order in which systemd calls are executed post-installation.   Build and enable mongodb PECL extension for all versions of PHP (not just 7.1). Previously, the extension was built and enabled only for PHP 7.1.   Remove needless call to restart nginx, as nginx is uninvolved with this process.   Delete comments left accidentally   Neglected to remove those commented lines; they are now unnecessary.",0

For the reasons described from https://github.com/laravel/homestead/issues/529#issuecomment-316290010 to the end of the thread, it seems appropriate to re-introduce Maria DB 10.2.x, now that the 10.2 series is marked GA/stable, per https://mariadb.com/kb/en/the-mariadb-library/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-102/ . Also, according to https://mariadb.com/kb/en/the-mariadb-library/system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-101-and-mysql-57/ , the default_password_lifetime is a MySQL-only variable determining how long passwords are valid for before expiring.

699,Merge pull request #143 from lancedikson/master,0.5192028,Fix bad merge conflict @svpernova09,"This changes a few things regarding SSL certificates and how they‚Äôre generated. First, the code to generate a certificate has been removed from each of the serve-[whatever] scripts and into it‚Äôs own script. The certificate generation code was duplicated 6 times, and in one instance (Symfony2) the checks to see whether or not a certificate was already created weren‚Äôt included, like they were in the others. So this change should help prevent things like that from happening again. DRY. Second big change is to the way the certificates are actually generated with OpenSSL. We‚Äôre now using an OpenSSL configuration file for each certificate that‚Äôs generated. They‚Äôre saved along-side the certificates. We‚Äôre doing this because the certificates must be generated using the subjectAltName property to list domains, and that property can only be added via configuration file. The subjectAltName property is the primary property that is used in validating domains. Historically, the CN (commonName) value was used to validate domains (as a fall-back), but apparently this was never to specification and recent browsers are removing that decade long oversight(?) A small change worth mentioning is the removal of the CSR (Certificate Signing Request). Since these are self-signed certificates, we don‚Äôt need to send a request to an authority to have the certificates created. We can just skip that step and create the certificate using the key.",0

Can we make utf8 / utf8_unicode_ci the default for Homestead's MySQL databases?  Specifying it at database creation seems like the simplest solution to me. We could also/instead modify the Homestead.yaml syntax to specify these.  For example... databases:     - name: homestead       charset: utf8       collation: utf8_unicode_ci But I'd still argue that UTF-8 should be the default.,0
