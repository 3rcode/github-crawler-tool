Note on Versioning
Homestead currently maintains support for 18.04 LTS via master branch, vagrant box version 9.x, Homestead Repo version 10.x, and 20.04 LTS via 20.04, vagrant box version 10.x. Homestead Repo version 11.x. To maintain this somewhat clear versioning separation while we continue to support both LTS versions instead of this PHP default change triggering a major version change, will only be a minor version change so that users can always rely on 9.x. This also allows us to avoid the ridiculous confusion releasing different LTS versions along the same box version numbers would bring.
As always: Homestead's support policy is to support the latest major Ubuntu LTS versions and supported PHP versions. This project relies heavily on chef/bento and Ondřej Surý's Ubuntu PPA. Please support these projects as much as you're able.

Enable or Disable Services
Homestead starts several services by default however if your configuration overrides one of these defaults you can specify which services you would like to enable or disable during provisioning. For example if you only needed PostgreSQL 12 your services: configuration in Homestead.yaml might look like:
services:
    - enabled:
        - ""postgresql@12-main""
    - disabled:
        - ""mysql""

This configuration would ensure postgresql@12-main service would be enabled and mysql would be disabled from starting at boot. The specified services will also be started or stopped based on their location in enabled and disabled sections.

MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL databases will only be created if the respective services are running.
Apache is now installed and disabled by default which should result in faster provisioning for site type apache.
SSL certificates are now installed at /etc/ssl/certs instead of /etc/nginx/ssl

Wildcard SSL
Homestead configures a self-signed SSL certificate for each site defined in the sites: section of your Homestead.yaml file. If you would like to generate a wildcard SSL certificate for a site you may add a wildcard option to that site's configuration. By default the site will use the wild card certificate instead of the specific domain certificate.
- map: foo.domain.test
  to: /home/vagrant/domain
  wildcard: ""yes""

If the use_wildcard option is set to no, the wildcard certificate will be generated but will not be used:
- map: foo.domain.test

This is an ALPHA release! It is not for the faint of heart.
https://app.vagrantup.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/8.0.0-alpha1
You will need the version_9 branch of Homestead

Base box upgraded to Ubuntu 19.04
New “Feature” syntax to install optional services or tools such as Golang, MariaDB, etc. 

Syntax to enable GoLang and MariaDB:
features:
    - golang: true
    - mariadb: true
* Blackfire Support has been moved to a feature and must be defined as such within Homestead.yaml
* Z-Ray support has been removed
* Postgres default to version 11
* If you are using Laravel Dusk or any other Webdriver utility you will need to enable the webdriver feature.
* Dot net core support has been removed.
* Ruby & Rails support has been removed.
* Site types have been moved to a folder to appear more obvious how they work/what they are.
* Probably more I'm forgetting...
Instructions

Add the following to Homestead.yaml: box: v8.0.0-alpha1
checkout v9.0.0-alpha1 of the Homestead repo.
Ensure you have converted any extra options to the new ""feature"" syntax (See Upgrade Notes)
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
","ALPHA Homestead v8 Upgrade notes ALPHA
STOP! STOP ! STOP!
If you are not comfortable debugging Vagrant and Homestead STOP NOW!
