AppInfoView: Change app description to Gtk.Label (#1723),0.5982294,Ellipsize long app names in App Info views," fix(AppInfoView): Change app description to Gtk.Label  This was originally a Gtk.Label in the very beginning, but early on was changed to be a Gtk.TextView in e37fc748b4693d64d48a119f532e181eb3dfd3c7 While working on changes to make AppCenter function at narrow window widths, I noticed that some applications (Notably Veloren in Flathub) had description widgets that prevented the window from shrinking below a minimum width which was very wide and unsuitable for narrow windows. Changing the App description to a label seems to prevent this, however, I was unsure of the original reasons for the change to a TextView   fix(style): minor code style fix   Update AppData with fix description.

Rewrite ScreenshotCache (#1350),0.38811204,Save some bandwidth by downloading smaller screenshots where appropriate,"When the screenshot cache folder goes over 100MB, there's some code in this class that gets stuck in an infinite loop, causing AppCenter to use 100% of a CPU core. And starts using another core every time you open a new app info page. Currently the only way to stop it is to kill appcenter and delete the screenshot cache folder. I've marked this as high priority as a result. When looking into that issue I found the code here didn't really fit with our code style, so I did the following: Added a copyright header Removed yoda conditions Used simpler GLib methods rather than doing stuff manually with C stdlib and Soup Removed while loops that had the potential to go on forever if stuff went wrong Returned booleans to indicate success or not instead of integers Removed the inline thread and just used async methods instead because we already use a thread to call on this class  By the time I was finished doing that, it was basically rewritten. It's easier to review the code in split diff view, or just read the new file.",0
