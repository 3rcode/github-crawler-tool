We added a guard in the cancel callback that ensures the task is running. We wonder if the joiners property should be reset to [] instead of null. It's another way of fixing this issue.",1

Merge pull request #52 from trevorsenior/bug/0-pattern,0.51103723,A small patch with the following merges,Fix effect type value of 0 not running effect.,0
Fix effect type value of 0 not running effect.,0.58100975,"- refactored shape of the effect objects to { [IO]: true, type, payload }, their structure should be treated as opaque anyway, so we hope this doesn't break anyone",If we have an action type with an int greater than 0: const INCREMENT_ASYNC = 1; This works fine. When we have an action type set to zero: const INCREMENT_ASYNC = 0; The effect that we want to run will not trigger because the value that is returned from the as function in io.js will be the number 0 which is falsey. This causes the promise ternary in runEffect to always fall through to the end condition: Promise.resolve(effect); Which is not what we want. This patch fixes the issue by checking if the value returned from the as function is undefined vs. relying on the truthiness of the returned value.,0
