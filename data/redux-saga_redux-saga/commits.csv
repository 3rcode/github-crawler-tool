This means an finished/ended forked task was cancelled unnecessarily. Because the joiners property is changed from an array to null when the task is ended, the subsequent cancellation that tries to remove the joiner from joiners caused a Cannot read property 'indexOf' of null error. We added a guard in the cancel callback that ensures the task is running. We wonder if the joiners property should be reset to [] instead of null. It's another way of fixing this issue.",Prevent cancellation of ended joined tasks,"Cancelling a join task caused all nested forked tasks to be cancelled as well, regardless of their status.

1761,Fix effect type value of 0 not running effect.,If we have an action type with an int greater than 0: const INCREMENT_ASYNC = 1;  This works fine. When we have an action type set to zero: const INCREMENT_ASYNC = 0;  The effect that we want to run will not trigger because the value that is returned from the as function in io.js will be the number 0 which is falsey. This causes the promise ternary in runEffect to always fall through to the end condition: Promise.resolve(effect);  Which is not what we want. This patch fixes the issue by checking if the value returned from the as function is undefined vs. relying on the truthiness of the returned value.,Fix effect type value of 0 not running effect.,If we have an action type with an int greater than 0: const INCREMENT_ASYNC = 1; This works fine.
