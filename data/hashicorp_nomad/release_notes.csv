FEATURES:

Edge compute improvements: Added support for reconnecting healthy allocations when disconnected clients reconnect. [GH-12476]
Native service discovery: Register and discover services using builtin simple service discovery. [GH-12368]

BREAKING CHANGES:

agent: The state database on both clients and servers will automatically migrate its underlying database on startup. Downgrading to a previous version of an agent after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. [GH-12107]
client: The client state store will be automatically migrated to a new schema version when upgrading a client. Downgrading to a previous version of the client after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. To downgrade safely, users should erase the Nomad client's data directory. [GH-12078]

created as Local rather than Global tokens. Nomad clusters with Connect services making cross-Consul
datacenter requests will need to ensure their Consul agents are configured with anonymous ACL tokens

FEATURES:

Native service discovery: Register and discover services using builtin simple service discovery. [GH-12368]
core: Added support for reconnecting healthy allocations when disconnected clients reconnect. [GH-12476]

BREAKING CHANGES:

agent: The state database on both clients and servers will automatically migrate its underlying database on startup. Downgrading to a previous version of an agent after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. [GH-12107]
client: The client state store will be automatically migrated to a new schema version when upgrading a client. Downgrading to a previous version of the client after upgrading it to Nomad 1.3 is not supported. To downgrade safely, users should erase the Nomad client's data directory. [GH-12078]
csi: The client filesystem layout for CSI plugins has been updated to correctly handle the lifecycle of multiple allocations serving the same plugin. Running plugin tasks will not be updated after upgrading the client, but it is recommended to redeploy CSI plugin jobs after upgrading the cluster. [GH-12078]
raft: The default raft protocol version is now 3 so you must follow the Upgrading to Raft Protocol 3 guide when upgrading an existing cluster to Nomad 1.3.0. Downgrading the raft protocol version is not supported. [GH-11572]

 * Reserved CPU cores: Improve the performance of your applications by ensuring tasks have exclusive use of client CPUs.
 * UI improvements: Enjoy a streamlined operator experience with fuzzy search, resource monitoring, and authentication improvements.
 * CSI enhancements: Run stateful applications with improved volume management and support for Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugins such as Ceph.
 * Readiness checks: Differentiate between application liveness and readiness with new options for task health checks.
 * Remote task drivers (technical preview): Use Nomad to manage your workloads on more platforms, such as AWS Lambda or Amazon ECS.

CVE-2020-28348 Nomad File Sandbox Escape via Container Volume Mount
A vulnerability was discovered in Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (“Nomad”) such that an operator with job submission capabilities can mount the host file system of a client agent and subvert the default Docker file sandbox feature when not explicitly disabled or when using a volume mount type. This vulnerability affects version 0.9.0 up to 0.12.7, and is fixed in the 0.12.8, 0.11.7, and 0.10.8 releases.
Nomad disables host filesystem access by default in 0.12.0 and above to prevent job operators from accessing the client filesystem used to persistently store any required data on disk. The Docker task driver provides a volume mount type which can be used to access the client host filesystem from within a container, but clients must be configured to enable mounting directories outside an allocation’s path to prevent abuse from unprivileged operators.
This issue is identified publicly as CVE-2020-28348.
Critical Bug During Upgrades from pre-0.9
A bug was identified in all versions of Nomad after 0.9.2. If a client agent is upgraded from a pre-0.9 version of Nomad to 0.9.2 or later; then all exec-based tasks (including exec, raw_exec, java, qemu) will fail to recover, will be leaked, and then Nomad will start another task. The leaked pre-0.9 task will run un-interrupted and unmanaged until the client dies or the task is killed manually.","Nomad 0.12.8, Nomad 0.11.7, and Nomad 0.10.8 were released with an important security fix and a critical bug fix:
