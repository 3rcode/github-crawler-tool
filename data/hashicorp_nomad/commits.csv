6,testing: improve fidelity of mock driver task restore (#16990),"While working on client status update improvements, I encountered problems getting tests with the mock driver to correctly restore. Unlike typical drivers the mock driver doesn't have an external source of truth for whether the task is running (ex. making API calls to dockerd or looking for a running PID), and so in order to make up that information, it re-parses the original task config. But the taskrunner doesn't call the encoding step for RecoverTask, only StartTask, so the task config the mock driver gets is missing data. Update the mock driver to stash the ""external"" state in the task state that we'll get from the task runner, so that we don't have to try to recover from the original TaskConfig anymore. This should bring the mock driver closer to the behavior of the other drivers."

18,logs: allow disabling log collection in jobspec (#16962),Some Nomad users ship application logs out-of-band via syslog. For these users having logmon (and docker_logger) running is unnecessary overhead. Allow disabling the logmon and pointing the task's stdout/stderr to /dev/null. This changeset is the first of several incremental improvements to log collection short of full-on logging plugins. The next step will likely be to extend the internal-only task driver configuration so that cluster administrators can turn off log collection for the entire driver.

But the -diff CLI flag was also being used to control whether the plan request should return the diff of not instead of just controlling if the diff was printed. This means that when -diff=false is set the response does not include any diff information, and so the new check panics. This commit fixes the problem by always requesting a diff and using the -diff only for controlling output, as it's currently documented."

51,consul/connect: fixed a bug where restarting proxy tasks failed. (#16815),"The first start of a Consul Connect proxy sidecar triggers a run of the envoy_version hook which modifies the task config image entry. The modification takes into account a number of factors to correctly populate this. Importantly, once the hook has run, it marks itself as done so the taskrunner will not execute it again. When the client receives a non-destructive update for the allocation which the proxy sidecar is a member of, it will update and overwrite the task definition within the taskerunner. In doing so it overwrite the modification performed by the hook. If the allocation is restarted, the envoy_version hook will be skipped as it previously marked itself as done, and therefore the sidecar config image is incorrect and causes a driver error. The fix removes the hook in marking itself as done to the view of the taskrunner."
52,api: enable support for setting original job source (#16763)," api: enable support for setting original source alongside job  This PR adds support for setting job source material along with the registration of a job. This includes a new HTTP endpoint and a new RPC endpoint for making queries for the original source of a job. The HTTP endpoint is /v1/job//submission?version= and the RPC method is Job.GetJobSubmission. The job source (if submitted, and doing so is always optional), is stored in the job_submission memdb table, separately from the actual job. This way we do not incur overhead of reading the large string field throughout normal job operations. The server config now includes job_max_source_size for configuring the maximum size the job source may be, before the server simply drops the source material. This should help prevent Bad Things from happening when huge jobs are submitted. If the value is set to 0, all job source material will be dropped.   api: avoid writing var content to disk for parsing   api: move submission validation into RPC layer   api: return an error if updating a job submission without namespace or job id   api: be exact about the job index we associate a submission with (modify)   api: reword api docs scheduling   api: prune all but the last 6 job submissions   api: protect against nil job submission in job validation   api: set max job source size in test server   api: fixups from pr "

57,ephemeral disk: migrate should imply sticky (#16826),"The ephemeral_disk block's migrate field allows for best-effort migration of the ephemeral disk data to new nodes. The documentation says the migrate field is only respected if sticky=true, but in fact if client ACLs are not set the data is migrated even if sticky=false. The existing behavior when client ACLs are disabled has existed since the early implementation, so ""fixing"" that case now would silently break backwards compatibility. Additionally, having migrate not imply sticky seems nonsensical: it suggests that if we place on a new node we migrate the data but if we place on the same node, we throw the data away! Update so that migrate=true implies sticky=true as follows:  The failure mode when client ACLs are enabled comes from the server not passing   along a migration token. Update the server so that the server provides a   migration token whenever migrate=true and not just when sticky=true too. Update the scheduler so that migrate implies sticky. Update the client so that we check for migrate || sticky where appropriate. Refactor the E2E tests to move them off the old framework and make the intention   of the test more clear."

This allows bypass of ACLs on RPC requests where ACL permissions are checked (like Job.Register). Invalid tokens are correctly rejected. Fix the bypass by only setting a client ID on the identity if we have a valid node secret. Note that this changeset will break rate metrics for RPCs sent by clients without a client secret such as Node.GetClientAllocs; these requests will be recorded as anonymous. Future work should: * Ensure the node secret is sent with all client-driven RPCs except   Node.Register which is TOFU. * Create a new acl.ACL object from client requests so that we   can enforce ACLs for all endpoints in a uniform way that's less error-prone.~

Currently the only consumers of this facility are the allocrunner CSI hook (which writes data) and the taskrunner volume hook (which reads that same data). The allocrunner hook for CSI volumes doesn't set the alloc hook resources atomically. Instead, it gets the current resources and then writes a new version back.

But in our plugin setup protocol, a plugin isn't ready for use until we call SetConfig. This meant that recovering pause containers was always done with the default config. Setting up the Docker client only happens once, so setting the wrong config in the recovery function also means that all other Docker API calls will use the default config. Move the recoveryPauseContainers call into the SetConfig. Fix the error handling so that we return any error but also don't log when the context is canceled, which happens twice during normal startup as we fingerprint the driver."

107,client/fingerprint: correctly fingerprint E/P cores of Apple Silicon chips (#16672)," client/fingerprint: correctly fingerprint E/P cores of Apple Silicon chips  This PR adds detection of asymetric core types (Power & Efficiency) (P/E) when running on M1/M2 Apple Silicon CPUs. This functionality is provided by shoenig/go-m1cpu which makes use of the Apple IOKit framework to read undocumented registers containing CPU performance data. Currently working on getting that functionality merged upstream into gopsutil, but gopsutil would still not support detecting P vs E cores like this PR does. Also refactors the CPUFingerprinter code to handle the mixed core types, now setting power vs efficiency cpu attributes. For now the scheduler is still unaware of mixed core types - on Apple platforms tasks cannot reserve cores anyway so it doesn't matter, but at least now the total CPU shares available will be correct. Future work should include adding support for detecting P/E cores on the latest and upcoming Intel chips, where computation of total cpu shares is currently incorrect. For that, we should also include updating the scheduler to be core-type aware, so that tasks of resources.cores on Linux platforms can be assigned the correct number of CPU shares for the core type(s) they have been assigned. node attributes before cpu.arch                  = arm64 cpu.modelname             = Apple M2 Pro cpu.numcores              = 12 cpu.reservablecores       = 0 cpu.totalcompute          = 1000 node attributes after cpu.arch                  = arm64 cpu.frequency.efficiency  = 2424 cpu.frequency.power       = 3504 cpu.modelname             = Apple M2 Pro cpu.numcores.efficiency   = 4 cpu.numcores.power        = 8 cpu.reservablecores       = 0 cpu.totalcompute          = 37728  fingerprint/cpu: follow up cr items"

116,scheduler: fix reconciliation of reconnecting allocs (#16609),"When a disconnect client reconnects the allocReconciler must find the allocations that were created to replace the original disconnected allocations. This process was being done in only a subset of non-terminal untainted allocations, meaning that, if the replacement allocations were not in this state the reconciler didn't stop them, leaving the job in an inconsistent state. This inconsistency is only solved in a future job evaluation, but at that point the allocation is considered reconnected and so the specific reconnection logic was not applied, leading to unexpected outcomes. This commit fixes the problem by running reconnecting allocation reconciliation logic earlier into the process, leaving the rest of the reconciler oblivious of reconnecting allocations. It also uses the full set of allocations to search for replacements, stopping them even if they are not in the untainted set. The system SystemScheduler is not affected by this bug because disconnected clients don't trigger replacements: every eligible client is already running an allocation."

The original concept is still worth implementing, as it allows this functionality to be exposed over an API that can be consumed by the Nomad UI and other clients.

Instead we'll mock the node watcher's dependencies (the job watcher and deadline notifier) and now unit tests can cover the real code. This allows us to remove a bunch of TODOs in watch_nodes.go around testing and clarify some important behaviors:   Nodes that are down or disconnected will still be watched until the scheduler   decides what to do with their allocations. This will drive the job watcher but   not the node watcher, and that lets the node watcher gracefully handle cases   where a heartbeat fails but the node heartbeats again before its allocs can be   evicted.   Stop watching nodes that have been deleted. The blocking query for nodes set   the maximum index to the highest index of a node it found, rather than the   index of the nodes table. This misses updates to the index from deleting   nodes. This was done as an performance optimization to avoid excessive   unblocking, but because the query is over all nodes anyways there's no   optimization to be had here. Remove the optimization so we can detect deleted   nodes without having to wait for an update to an unrelated node. "

Policies set on the variables the job automatically has access to were ignored, but this includes policies with deny capabilities. Additionally, when resolving claims for a workload identity without any attached policies, the ResolveClaims method returned a nil ACL object, which is treated similarly to a management token. While this was safe in Nomad 1.4.x, when the workload identity token was exposed to the task via the identity block, this allows a user with submit-job capabilities to escalate their privileges. We originally implemented automatic workload access to Variables as a separate code path in the Variables RPC endpoint so that we don't have to generate on-the-fly policies that blow up the ACL policy cache. This is fairly brittle but also the behavior around wildcard paths in policies different from the rest of our ACL polices, which is hard to reason about. Add an ACLClaim parameter to the AllowVariableOperation method so that we can push all this logic into the acl package and the behavior can be consistent. This will allow a deny policy to override automatic access (and probably speed up checks of non-automatic variable access)."

183,scheduling: prevent self-collision in dynamic port network offerings (#16401),"When the scheduler tries to find a placement for a new allocation, it iterates over a subset of nodes. For each node, we populate a NetworkIndex bitmap with the ports of all existing allocations and any other allocations already proposed as part of this same evaluation via its SetAllocs method. Then we make an ""ask"" of the NetworkIndex in AssignPorts for any ports we need and receive an ""offer"" in return. The offer will include both static ports and any dynamic port assignments. The AssignPorts method was written to support group networks, and it shares code that selects dynamic ports with the original AssignTaskNetwork code. AssignTaskNetwork can request multiple ports from the bitmap at a time. But AssignPorts requests them one at a time and does not account for possible collisions, and doesn't return an error in that case. What happens next varies:  If the scheduler doesn't place the allocation on that node, the port    conflict is thrown away and there's no problem. If the node is picked and this is the only allocation (or last allocation),    the plan applier will reject the plan when it calls SetAllocs, as we'd expect. If the node is picked and there are additional allocations in the same eval    that iterate over the same node, their call to SetAllocs will detect the    impossible state and the node will be rejected. This can have the puzzling    behavior where a second task group for the job without any networking at all    can hit a port collision error!  It looks like this bug has existed since we implemented group networks, but there are several factors that add up to making the issue rare for many users yet frustratingly frequent for others:  You're more likely to hit this bug the more tightly packed your range for   dynamic ports is. With 12000 ports in the range by default, many clusters can   avoid this for a long time. You're more likely to hit case (3) for jobs with lots of allocations or if a   scheduler has to iterate over a large number of nodes, such as with system jobs,   jobs with spread blocks, or (sometimes) jobs using unique constraints.  For unlucky combinations of these factors, it's possible that case (3) happens repeatedly, preventing scheduling of a given job until a client state change (ex. restarting the agent so all its allocations are rescheduled elsewhere) re-opens the range of dynamic ports available. This changeset:  Fixes the bug by accounting for collisions in dynamic port selection in   AssignPorts. Adds test coverage for AssignPorts, expands coverage of this case for the   deprecated AssignTaskNetwork, and tightens the dynamic port range in a   scheduler test for spread scheduling to more easily detect this kind of problem   in the future. Adds a String() method to Bitmap so that any future ""screaming"" log lines   have a human-readable list of used ports."

185,client: disable running artifact downloader as nobody (#16375)," client: disable running artifact downloader as nobody  This PR reverts a change from Nomad 1.5 where artifact downloads were executed as the nobody user on Linux systems. This was done as an attempt to improve the security model of artifact downloading where third party tools such as git or mercurial would be run as the root user with all the security implications thereof. However, doing so conflicts with Nomad's own advice for securing the Client data directory - which when setup with the recommended directory permissions structure prevents artifact downloads from working as intended. Artifact downloads are at least still now executed as a child process of the Nomad agent, and on modern Linux systems make use of the kernel Landlock feature for limiting filesystem access of the child process.   docs: update upgrade guide for 1.5.1 sandboxing   docs: add cl   docs: add title to upgrade guide fix "

205,api: set last index and request time on alloc stop (#16319),"Some of the methods in Allocations() incorrectly use the putQuery in API calls where put is more appropriate since they are not reading information back. These methods are also not returning request metadata such as LastIndex back to callers, which can be useful to have in some scenarios. They also provide poor developer experience as they take an *api.Allocation struct when only the allocation ID is necessary. This can lead consumers to make unnecessary API calls to fetch the full allocation. Fixing these problems require updating the methods' signatures so they take *WriteOptions instead of *QueryOptions and return *WriteMeta, but this is a breaking change that requires advanced notice to consumers. This commit adds a future breaking change notice and also fixes the Stop method so it properly returns request metadata in a backwards compatible way."

209,service: fix regression in task access to list/read endpoint (#16316),"When native service discovery was added, we used the node secret as the auth token. Once Workload Identity was added in Nomad 1.4.x we needed to use the claim token for template blocks, and so we allowed valid claims to bypass the ACL policy check to preserve the existing behavior. (Invalid claims are still rejected, so this didn't widen any security boundary.) In reworking authentication for 1.5.0, we unintentionally removed this bypass. For WIs without a policy attached to their job, everything works as expected because the resulting acl.ACL is nil. But once a policy is attached to the job the acl.ACL is no longer nil and this causes permissions errors. Fix the regression by adding back the bypass for valid claims. In future work, we should strongly consider getting turning the implicit policies into real ACLPolicy objects (even if not stored in state) so that we don't have these kind of brittle exceptions to the auth code."

216,handle FSM.Apply errors in raftApply (#16287),"The signature of the raftApply function requires that the caller unwrap the first returned value (the response from FSM.Apply) to see if it's an error. This puts the burden on the caller to remember to check two different places for errors, and we've done so inconsistently. Update raftApply to do the unwrapping for us and return any FSM.Apply error as the error value. Similar work was done in Consul in https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/9991. This eliminates some boilerplate and surfaces a few minor bugs in the process:  job deregistrations of already-GC'd jobs were still emitting evals reconcile job summaries does not return scheduler errors node updates did not report errors associated with inconsistent service   discovery or CSI plugin states  Note that although most of the FSM.Apply functions return only errors (which makes it tempting to remove the first return value entirely), there are few that return bool for some reason and Variables relies on the response value for proper CAS checking."
217,deps: update go-plugin to 1.4.9 (#16292),"Fixes #16288. An earlier version of go-plugin introduced a warning log if SecureConfig is unset. For Nomad and other applications that have ""internal"" go-plugin consumers where the application runs itself as a plugin, this causes spurious warn-level logs. For Nomad in particular this means every task driver and logmon invocation emits the log, which is our primary operation. The change was reverted upstream, so this changeset picks up the reverted version."

219,client: use RPC address and not serf after initial Consul discovery (#16217),"Nomad servers can advertise independent IP addresses for serf and rpc. Somewhat unexpectedly, the serf address is also used for both Serf and server-to-server RPC communication (including Raft RPC). The address advertised for rpc is only used for client-to-server RPC. This split was introduced intentionally in Nomad 0.8. When clients are using Consul discovery for connecting to servers, they get an initial discovery set from Consul and use the correct rpc tag in Consul to get a list of adddresses for servers. The client then makes a Status.Peers RPC to get the list of those servers that are raft peers. But this endpoint is shared between servers and clients, and provides the address used for Raft. Most of the time this is harmless because servers will bind on 0.0.0.0 anyways., But in topologies where servers are on a private network and clients are on separate subnets (or even public subnets), clients will make initial contact with the server to get the list of peers but then populate their local server set with unreachable addresses. Cluster administrators can work around this problem by using server_join with specific IP addresses (or DNS names), because the Node.UpdateStatus endpoint returns the correct set of RPC addresses when updating the node. So once a client has registered, it will get the correct set of RPC addresses. This changeset updates the client logic to query Status.Members instead of Status.Peers, and then extract the correctly advertised address and port from the response body."

When checking if it's safe to force-deregister the volume.

Under normal workloads this is likely to be safe but when the eval broker is under the heavy load this feature is intended to fix, we're likely to have a race condition. Switch this to a write lock, like the other locks that mutate the eval broker state.

This is a regression from the existing behavior, so have this endpoint ignore auth errors the same way we do for every other unauthenticated endpoint (ex Status.Peers)"

287,users: create cache for user lookups (#16100)," users: create cache for user lookups  This PR introduces a global cache for OS user lookups. This should relieve pressure on the OS domain/directory lookups, which would be queried more now that Task API exists. Hits are cached for 1 hour, and misses are cached for 1 minute. These values are fairly arbitrary - we can tweak them if there is any reason to. Closes #16010  users: delete expired negative entry from cache"

Update the commented-out line to the previous value and update the documented examples to match that. This matches most of the examples for Consul/Vault licensing as well. I've double-checked the tutorials and it looks like it'd been left on the previous value there, so no additional work to be done."

Update docs to make it clear that NOMAD_ALLOC_INDEX is always zero for  system/sysbatch jobs Validate that volume.per_alloc is incompatible with system/sysbatch jobs.

383,core: enforce strict steps for clients reconnect (#15808),"When a Nomad client that is running an allocation with max_client_disconnect set misses a heartbeat the Nomad server will update its status to disconnected. Upon reconnecting, the client will make three main RPC calls:  Node.UpdateStatus is used to set the client status to ready. Node.UpdateAlloc is used to update the client-side information about   allocations, such as their ClientStatus, task states etc. Node.Register is used to upsert the entire node information,   including its status.  These calls are made concurrently and are also running in parallel with the scheduler. Depending on the order they run the scheduler may end up with incomplete data when reconciling allocations. For example, a client disconnects and its replacement allocation cannot be placed anywhere else, so there's a pending eval waiting for resources. When this client comes back the order of events may be:  Client calls Node.UpdateStatus and is now ready. Scheduler reconciles allocations and places the replacement alloc to    the client. The client is now assigned two allocations: the original    alloc that is still unknown and the replacement that is pending. Client calls Node.UpdateAlloc and updates the original alloc to    running. Scheduler notices too many allocs and stops the replacement.  This creates unnecessary placements or, in a different order of events, may leave the job without any allocations running until the whole state is updated and reconciled. To avoid problems like this clients must update all of its relevant information before they can be considered ready and available for scheduling. To achieve this goal the RPC endpoints mentioned above have been modified to enforce strict steps for nodes reconnecting:  Node.Register does not set the client status anymore. Node.UpdateStatus sets the reconnecting client to the initializing   status until it successfully calls Node.UpdateAlloc.  These changes are done server-side to avoid the need of additional coordination between clients and servers. Clients are kept oblivious of these changes and will keep making these calls as they normally would. The verification of whether allocations have been updates is done by storing and comparing the Raft index of the last time the client missed a heartbeat and the last time it updated its allocations."
384,WI: allow workloads to use RPCs associated with HTTP API (#15870),"This changeset allows Workload Identities to authenticate to all the RPCs that support HTTP API endpoints, for use with PR #15864.  Extends the work done for pre-forwarding authentication to all RPCs that   support a HTTP API endpoint. Consolidates the auth helpers used by the CSI, Service Registration, and Node   endpoints that are currently used to support both tokens and client secrets.  Intentionally excluded from this changeset: * The Variables endpoint still has custom handling because of the implicit   policies. Ideally we'll figure out an efficient way to resolve those into real   policies and then we can get rid of that custom handling. * The RPCs that don't currently support auth tokens (i.e. those that don't   support HTTP endpoints) have not been updated with the new pre-forwarding auth   We'll be doing this under a separate PR to support RPC rate metrics."

386,acl: Fix panic when bogus token is passed (#15863),"If a consumer of the new Authenticate method gets passed a bogus token that's a correctly-shaped UUID, it will correctly get an identity without a ACL token. But most consumers will then panic when they consume this nil ACLToken for authorization. Because no API client should ever send a bogus auth token, update the Authenticate method to create the identity with remote IP (for metrics tracking) but also return an ErrPermissionDenied."

This changeset demonstrates the change with the new ACL.WhoAmI RPC, and we'll wire up the remaining RPCs once we've threaded the new pre-forwarding authentication through the all. Note that metrics are measured after we forward but before we return any authentication error. This ensures that we only emit metrics on the server that actually serves the request. We'll perform rate limiting at the same place. Includes telemetry configuration to omit identity labels."
389,implement pre-forwarding auth on select RPCs (#15513),"In #15417 we added a new Authenticate method to the server that returns an AuthenticatedIdentity struct.

390,client: add disk_total_mb and disk_free_mb config options (#15852),
391,core: backoff considerably when worker is behind raft (#15523),"Upon dequeuing an evaluation workers snapshot their state store at the eval's wait index or later. This ensures we process an eval at a point in time after it was created or updated. Processing an eval on an old snapshot could cause any number of problems such as:  Since job registration atomically updates an eval and job in a single    raft entry, scheduling against indexes before that may not have the    eval's job or may have an older version. The older the scheduler's snapshot, the higher the likelihood    something has changed in the cluster state which will cause the plan    applier to reject the scheduler's plan. This could waste work or    even cause eval's to be failed needlessly.  However, the workers run in parallel with a new server pulling the cluster state from a peer. During this time, which may be many minutes long, the state store is likely far behind the minimum index required to process evaluations. This PR addresses this by adding an additional long backoff period after an eval is nacked. If the scheduler's indexes catches up within the additional backoff, it will unblock early to dequeue the next eval. When the server shuts down we'll get a context.Canceled error from the state store method. We need to bubble this error up so that other callers can detect it. Handle this case separately when waiting after dequeue so that we can warn on shutdown instead of throwing an ambiguous error message with just the text ""canceled."" While there may be more precise ways to block scheduling until the server catches up, this approach adds little risk and covers additional cases where a server may be temporarily behind due to a spike in load or a saturated network. For testing, we make the raftSyncLimit into a parameter on the worker's run method  so that we can run backoff tests without waiting 30+ seconds. We haven't followed thru and made all the worker globals into worker parameters, because there isn't much use outside of testing, but we can consider that in the future.

393,Rename nomad.broker.total_blocked metric (#15835),"This changeset fixes a long-standing point of confusion in metrics emitted by the eval broker. The eval broker has a queue of ""blocked"" evals that are waiting for an in-flight (""unacked"") eval of the same job to be completed. But this ""blocked"" state is not the same as the blocked status that we write to raft and expose in the Nomad API to end users. There's a second metric nomad.blocked_eval.total_blocked that refers to evaluations in that state. This has caused ongoing confusion in major customer incidents and even in our own documentation! (Fixed in this PR.) There's little functional change in this PR aside from the name of the metric emitted, but there's a bit refactoring to clean up the names in eval_broker.go so that there aren't name collisions and multiple names for the same state. Changes included are: * Everything that was previously called ""pending"" referred to entities that were   associated witht he ""ready"" metric. These are all now called ""ready"" to match   the metric. * Everything named ""blocked"" in eval_broker.go is now named ""pending"", except   for a couple of comments that actually refer to blocked RPCs. * Added a note to the upgrade guide docs for 1.5.0. * Fixed the scheduling performance metrics docs because the description for   nomad.broker.total_blocked was actually the description for   nomad.blocked_eval.total_blocked."

In some cases, the Consul may be slow in processing the check registration, and the response object would not contain checks. Nomad would then scan the empty response looking for Checks with failing health status, finding none, and then marking a task/alloc as healthy. In reality, we must always use Nomad's view of what checks should exist as the source of truth, and compare that with the response Consul gives us, making sure they match, before scanning the Consul response for failing check statuses.

444,Authenticate method improvements (#15734),"This changeset covers a sidebar discussion that @schmichael and I had around the design for pre-forwarding auth. This includes some changes extracted out of 15513 to make it easier to review both and leave a clean history.   Remove fast path for NodeID. Previously-connected clients will have a NodeID   set on the context, and because this is a large portion of the RPCs sent we   fast-pathed it at the top of the Authenticate method. But the context is   shared for all yamux streams over the same yamux session (and TCP   connection). This lets an authenticated HTTP request to a client use the   NodeID for authentication, which is a privilege escalation. Remove the fast   path and annotate it so that we don't break it again.   Add context to decisions around AuthenticatedIdentity. The Authenticate   method taken on its own looks like it wants to return an acl.ACL that folds   over all the various identity types (creating an ephemeral ACL on the fly if   neccessary). But keeping these fields idependent allows RPC handlers to   differentiate between internal and external origins so we most likely want to   avoid this. Leave some docstrings as a warning as to why this is built the way   it is.   Mutate the request rather than returning. When reviewing #15513 we decided   that forcing the request handler to call SetIdentity was repetitive and   error prone. Instead, the Authenticate method mutates the request by setting   its AuthenticatedIdentity. "
445,docker: configure restart policy for networking pause container (#15732),"This PR modifies the configuration of the networking pause contaier to include the ""unless-stopped"" restart policy. The pause container should always be restored into a running state until Nomad itself issues a stop command for the container. This is not a perfect fix for #12216 but it should cover the 99% use case - where a pause container gets accidently stopped / killed for some reason. There is still a possibility where the pause container and main task container are stopped and started in the order where the bad behavior persists, but this is fundamentally unavoidable due to how docker itself abstracts and manages the underlying network namespace referenced by the containers. Closes #12216"

At   some point we might want to give this an equivalent HTTP endpoint but I didn't   want to add that to our public API until some of the other Workload Identity   work is solidified, especially if we don't need it yet. * A full coverage test of the Authenticate method. This sets up two server   nodes with mTLS and ACLs, some tokens, and some allocations with workload   identities. * Wire up an example of using Authenticate in the Namespace.Upsert RPC and   see how authorization happens after forwarding. * A new semgrep rule for Authenticate, which we'll need to update once we're   ready to wire up more RPC endpoints with authorization steps."

521,remove most static RPC handlers (#15451),"Nomad server components that aren't in the nomad package like the deployment watcher and volume watcher need to make RPC calls but can't import the Server struct to do so because it creates a circular reference. These components have a ""shim"" object that gets populated to pass a ""static"" handler that has no RPC context. Most RPC handlers are never used in this way, but during server setup we were constructing a set of static handlers for most RPC endpoints anyways. This is slightly wasteful but also confusing to developers who end up being encouraged to just copy what was being done for previous RPCs. This changeset includes the following refactorings: * Remove the static handlers field on the server * Instead construct just the specific static handlers we need to pass into the   deployment watcher and volume watcher. * Remove the unnecessary static handler from heartbeater * Update various tests to avoid needing the static endpoints and have them use a   endpoint constructed on the spot. Follow-up work will examine whether we can remove the RPCs from deployment watcher and volume watcher entirely, falling back to raft applies like node drainer does currently."

This changeset adds the context to everywhere we intend to initially support it and intentionally excludes streaming RPCs and client RPCs. To improve the ergonomics of adding the context everywhere its needed and to clarify the requirements of dynamic vs static handlers, I've also done a good bit of refactoring here:  canonicalized the RPC handler fields so they're as close to identical as   possible without introducing unused fields (i.e. I didn't add loggers if the   handler doesn't use them already). canonicalized the imports in the handler files. added a NewExampleEndpoint function for each handler that ensures we're   constructing the handlers with the required arguments. reordered the registration in server.go to match the order of the files (to   make it easier to see if we've missed one), and added a bunch of commentary   there as to what the difference between static and dynamic handlers is."

When doing the differential between services Nomad expects to be registered vs. the services actually registered into Consul, we must first purge these automatically inserted tagged_addresses if they do not exist in the Nomad view of the Consul service."

546,scheduler: create placements for non-register MRD (#15325)," scheduler: create placements for non-register MRD  For multiregion jobs, the scheduler does not create placements on registration because the deployment must wait for the other regions. Once of these regions will then trigger the deployment to run. Currently, this is done in the scheduler by considering any eval for a multiregion job as ""paused"" since it's expected that another region will eventually unpause it. This becomes a problem where evals not triggered by a job registration happen, such as on a node update. These types of regional changes do not have other regions waiting to progress the deployment, and so they were never resulting in placements. The fix is to create a deployment at job registration time. This additional piece of state allows the scheduler to differentiate between a multiregion change, where there are other regions engaged in the deployment so no placements are required, from a regional change, where the scheduler does need to create placements. This deployment starts in the new ""initializing"" status to signal to the scheduler that it needs to compute the initial deployment state. The multiregion deployment will wait until this deployment state is persisted and its starts is set to ""pending"". Without this state transition it's possible to hit a race condition where the plan applier and the deployment watcher may step of each other and overwrite their changes.  changelog: add entry for #15325"

572,client: accommodate Consul 1.14.0 gRPC and agent self changes. (#15309)," client: accommodate Consul 1.14.0 gRPC and agent self changes.  Consul 1.14.0 changed the way in which gRPC listeners are configured, particularly when using TLS. Prior to the change, a single listener was responsible for handling plain-text and encrypted gRPC requests. In 1.14.0 and beyond, separate listeners will be used for each, defaulting to 8502 and 8503 for plain-text and TLS respectively. The change means that Nomad’s Consul Connect integration would not work when integrated with Consul clusters using TLS and running 1.14.0 or greater. The Nomad Consul fingerprinter identifies the gRPC port Consul has exposed using the ""DebugConfig.GRPCPort"" value from Consul’s “/v1/agent/self” endpoint. In Consul 1.14.0 and greater, this only represents the plain-text gRPC port which is likely to be disbaled in clusters running TLS. In order to fix this issue, Nomad now takes into account the Consul version and configured scheme to optionally use “DebugConfig.GRPCTLSPort” value from Consul’s agent self return. The “consul_grcp_socket” allocrunner hook has also been updated so that the fingerprinted gRPC port attribute is passed in. This provides a better fallback method, when the operator does not configure the “consul.grpc_address” option.   docs: modify Consul Connect entries to detail 1.14.0 changes.   changelog: add entry for #15309   fixup: tidy tests and clean version match from review feedback.   fixup: use strings tolower func.

587,autopilot: include only servers from the same region (#15290),"When we migrated to the updated autopilot library in Nomad 1.4.0, the interface for finding servers changed. Previously autopilot would get the serf members and call IsServer on each of them, leaving it up to the implementor to filter out clients (and in Nomad's case, other regions). But in the ""new"" autopilot library, the equivalent interface is KnownServers for which we did not filter by region.

In addition to operator-initiated restores, when fresh servers are added to existing clusters with large-enough state, the keyring replication can get started quickly enough that it's running before the snapshot from the existing clusters have been restored. Fix this by updating the handle to the state store on each pass."

At that point, we no longer need to retain blocked evaluations in the broker that are older than that index. Move all but the highest priority / highest ModifyIndex blocked eval into a canceled set. When the Eval.Ack RPC returns from the eval broker it will signal a reap of a batch of cancelable evals to write to raft. This paces the cancelations limited by how frequently the schedulers are acknowledging evals; this should reduce the risk of cancelations from overwhelming raft relative to scheduler progress. In order to avoid straggling batches when the cluster is quiet, we also include a periodic sweep through the cancelable list."

601,eval delete: move batching of deletes into RPC handler and state (#15117),"During unusual outage recovery scenarios on large clusters, a backlog of millions of evaluations can appear. In these cases, the eval delete command can put excessive load on the cluster by listing large sets of evals to extract the IDs and then sending larges batches of IDs. Although the command's batch size was carefully tuned, we still need to be JSON deserialize, re-serialize to MessagePack, send the log entries through raft, and get the FSM applied. To improve performance of this recovery case, move the batching process into the RPC handler and the state store. The design here is a little weird, so let's look a the failed options first:   A naive solution here would be to just send the filter as the raft request and   let the FSM apply delete the whole set in a single operation. Benchmarking with   1M evals on a 3 node cluster demonstrated this can block the FSM apply for   several minutes, which puts the cluster at risk if there's a leadership   failover (the barrier write can't be made while this apply is in-flight).   A less naive but still bad solution would be to have the RPC handler filter   and paginate, and then hand a list of IDs to the existing raft log   entry. Benchmarks showed this blocked the FSM apply for 20-30s at a time and   took roughly an hour to complete.   Instead, we're filtering and paginating in the RPC handler to find a page token, and then passing both the filter and page token in the raft log. The FSM apply recreates the paginator using the filter and page token to get roughly the same page of evaluations, which it then deletes. The pagination process is fairly cheap (only abut 5% of the total FSM apply time), so counter-intuitively this rework ends up being much faster. A benchmark of 1M evaluations showed this blocked the FSM apply for 20-30ms at a time (typical for normal operations) and completes in less than 4 minutes. Note that, as with the existing design, this delete is not consistent: a new evaluation inserted ""behind"" the cursor of the pagination will fail to be deleted."

But we don't check any host volume mounts, which should be safe to use as a source for executables if we're letting the user mount them to the container in the first place. Check the mount config to verify the executable lives in the mount's host path, but then return an absolute path within the mount's task path so that we can hand that off to libcontainer to run. Includes a good bit of refactoring here because the anchoring of the final task path has different code paths for inside the task dir vs inside a mount.

613,api: remove mapstructure tags fromPort struct (#12916),"This PR solves a defect in the deserialization of api.Port structs when returning structs from theEventStream. Previously, the api.Port struct's fields were decorated with both mapstructure and hcl tags to support the network.port stanza's use of the keyword static when posting a static port value. This works fine when posting a job and when retrieving any struct that has an embedded api.Port instance as long as the value is deserialized using JSON decoding. The EventStream, however, uses mapstructure to decode event payloads in the api package. mapstructure expects an underlying field named static which does not exist. The result was that the Port.Value field would always be set to 0. Upon further inspection, a few things became apparent. The struct already has hcl tags that support the indirection during job submission. Serialization/deserialization with both the json and hcl packages produce the desired result. The use of of the mapstructure tags provided no value as the Port struct contains only fields with primitive types. This PR: Removes the mapstructure tags from the api.Port structs Updates the job parsing logic to use hcl instead of mapstructure when decoding Port instances.

617,API for Eval.Count (#15147),"Add a new Eval.Count RPC and associated HTTP API endpoints. This API is designed to support interactive use in the nomad eval delete command to get a count of evals expected to be deleted before doing so. The state store operations to do this sort of thing are somewhat expensive, but it's cheaper than serializing a big list of evals to JSON. Note that although it seems like this could be done as an extra parameter and response field on Eval.List, having it as its own endpoint avoids having to change the response body shape and lets us avoid handling the legacy filter params supported by Eval.List."

623,Update alloc after reconnect and enforece client heartbeat order (#15068)," scheduler: allow updates after alloc reconnects  When an allocation reconnects to a cluster the scheduler needs to run special logic to handle the reconnection, check if a replacement was create and stop one of them. If the allocation kept running while the node was disconnected, it will be reconnected with ClientStatus: running and the node will have Status: ready. This combination is the same as the normal steady state of allocation, where everything is running as expected. In order to differentiate between the two states (an allocation that is reconnecting and one that is just running) the scheduler needs an extra piece of state. The current implementation uses the presence of a TaskClientReconnected task event to detect when the allocation has reconnected and thus must go through the reconnection process. But this event remains even after the allocation is reconnected, causing all future evals to consider the allocation as still reconnecting. This commit changes the reconnect logic to use an AllocState to register when the allocation was reconnected. This provides the following benefits:  Only a limited number of task states are kept, and they are used for     many other events. It's possible that, upon reconnecting, several     actions are triggered that could cause the TaskClientReconnected     event to be dropped. Task events are set by clients and so their timestamps are subject     to time skew from servers. This prevents using time to determine if     an allocation reconnected after a disconnect event. Disconnect events are already stored as AllocState and so storing     reconnects there as well makes it the only source of information     required.  With the new logic, the reconnection logic is only triggered if the last AllocState is a disconnect event, meaning that the allocation has not been reconnected yet. After the reconnection is handled, the new ClientStatus is store in AllocState allowing future evals to skip the reconnection logic.  scheduler: prevent spurious placement on reconnect  When a client reconnects it makes two independent RPC calls:  Node.UpdateStatus to heartbeat and set its status as ready. Node.UpdateAlloc to update the status of its allocations.  These two calls can happen in any order, and in case the allocations are updated before a heartbeat it causes the state to be the same as a node being disconnected: the node status will still be disconnected while the allocation ClientStatus is set to running. The current implementation did not handle this order of events properly, and the scheduler would create an unnecessary placement since it considered the allocation was being disconnected. This extra allocation would then be quickly stopped by the heartbeat eval. This commit adds a new code path to handle this order of events. If the node is disconnected and the allocation ClientStatus is running the scheduler will check if the allocation is actually reconnecting using its AllocState events.  rpc: only allow alloc updates from ready nodes  Clients interact with servers using three main RPC methods:  Node.GetAllocs reads allocation data from the server and writes it     to the client. Node.UpdateAlloc reads allocation from from the client and writes     them to the server. Node.UpdateStatus writes the client status to the server and is     used as the heartbeat mechanism.  These three methods are called periodically by the clients and are done so independently from each other, meaning that there can't be any assumptions in their ordering. This can generate scenarios that are hard to reason about and to code for. For example, when a client misses too many heartbeats it will be considered down or disconnected and the allocations it was running are set to lost or unknown. When connectivity is restored the to rest of the cluster, the natural mental model is to think that the client will heartbeat first and then update its allocations status into the servers. But since there's no inherit order in these calls the reverse is just as possible: the client updates the alloc status and then heartbeats. This results in a state where allocs are, for example, running while the client is still disconnected. This commit adds a new verification to the Node.UpdateAlloc method to reject updates from nodes that are not ready, forcing clients to heartbeat first. Since this check is done server-side there is no need to coordinate operations client-side: they can continue sending these requests independently and alloc update will succeed after the heartbeat is done.   chagelog: add entry for #15068   code review   client: skip terminal allocations on reconnect   When the client reconnects with the server it synchronizes the state of its allocations by sending data using the Node.UpdateAlloc RPC and fetching data using the Node.GetClientAllocs RPC. If the data fetch happens before the data write, unknown allocations will still be in this state and would trigger the allocRunner.Reconnect flow. But when the server DesiredStatus for the allocation is stop the client should not reconnect the allocation.   apply more code review changes   scheduler: persist changes to reconnected allocs   Reconnected allocs have a new AllocState entry that must be persisted by the plan applier.  rpc: read node ID from allocs in UpdateAlloc  The AllocUpdateRequest struct is used in three disjoint use cases:  Stripped allocs from clients Node.UpdateAlloc RPC using the Allocs,    and WriteRequest fields Raft log message using the Allocs, Evals, and WriteRequest fields Plan updates using the AllocsStopped, AllocsUpdated, and Job fields  Adding a new field that would only be used in one these cases (1) made things more confusing and error prone. While in theory an AllocUpdateRequest could send allocations from different nodes, in practice this never actually happens since only clients call this method with their own allocations.  scheduler: remove logic to handle exceptional case  This condition could only be hit if, somehow, the allocation status was set to ""running"" while the client was ""unknown"". This was addressed by enforcing an order in ""Node.UpdateStatus"" and ""Node.UpdateAlloc"" RPC calls, so this scenario is not expected to happen. Adding unnecessary code to the scheduler makes it harder to read and reason about it.   more code review   remove another unused test "
624,client: retry RPC call when no server is available (#15140),"When a Nomad service starts it tries to establish a connection with servers, but it also runs alloc runners to manage whatever allocations it needs to run. The alloc runner will invoke several hooks to perform actions, with some of them requiring access to the Nomad servers, such as Native Service Discovery Registration. If the alloc runner starts before a connection is established the alloc runner will fail, causing the allocation to be shutdown. This is particularly problematic for disconnected allocations that are reconnecting, as they may fail as soon as the client reconnects. This commit changes the RPC request logic to retry it, using the existing retry mechanism, if there are no servers available."

This causes service discovery queries to fail. Fallback to the node's secret ID when the allocation doesn't have a signed identity.

Simply doing a nil-check at the top of the loop reveals a race condition around shutting down the loop just as a new update is coming in. Have the parent volumeswatcher send an initial update on the channel before returning, so that we're still holding the lock. Update the watcher's Stop method to set the running state, which lets us avoid having a second context and makes stopping synchronous. This reduces the cases we have to handle in the run loop. Updated the tests now that we'll safely return from the goroutine and stop the runner in a larger set of cases.

637,keyring: safely handle missing keys and restore GC (#15092),"When replication of a single key fails, the replication loop breaks early and therefore keys that fall later in the sorting order will never get replicated. This is particularly a problem for clusters impacted by the bug that caused #14981 and that were later upgraded; the keys that were never replicated can now never be replicated, and so we need to handle them safely. Included in the replication fix: * Refactor the replication loop so that each key replicated in a function call   that returns an error, to make the workflow more clear and reduce nesting. Log   the error and continue. * Improve stability of keyring replication tests. We no longer block leadership   on initializing the keyring, so there's a race condition in the keyring tests   where we can test for the existence of the root key before the keyring has   been initialize. Change this to an ""eventually"" test. But these fixes aren't enough to fix #14981 because they'll end up seeing an error once a second complaining about the missing key, so we also need to fix keyring GC so the keys can be removed from the state store. Now we'll store the key ID used to sign a workload identity in the Allocation, and we'll index the Allocation table on that so we can track whether any live Allocation was signed with a particular key ID."

Nomad needs these controllers enabled to operate: - cpuset - cpu - io - memory - pids Now, Nomad will ensure these controllers are enabled during Client initialization, adding them to cgroup.subtree_control as necessary. This should be particularly helpful on the RHEL/CentOS/Fedora family of system. Ubuntu systems should be unaffected as they enable all controllers by default.

Fix this so that users can set their own thresholds. The root key is automatically rotated every ~30d, but the function that does both rotation and key GC was wired up such that nomad system gc caused an unexpected key rotation. Split this into two functions so that nomad system gc cleans up old keys without forcing a rotation, which will be done periodially or by the nomad operator root keyring rotate command."

671,keyring: fixes for keyring replication on cluster join (#14987)," keyring: don't unblock early if rate limit burst exceeded  The rate limiter returns an error and unblocks early if its burst limit is exceeded (unless the burst limit is Inf). Ensure we're not unblocking early, otherwise we'll only slow down the cases where we're already pausing to make external RPC requests.  keyring: set MinQueryIndex on stale queries  When keyring replication makes a stale query to non-leader peers to find a key the leader doesn't have, we need to make sure the peer we're querying has had a chance to catch up to the most current index for that key. Otherwise it's possible for newly-added servers to query another newly-added server and get a non-error nil response for that key ID. Ensure that we're setting the correct reply index in the blocking query. Note that the ""not found"" case does not return an error, just an empty key. So as a belt-and-suspenders, update the handling of empty responses so that we don't break the loop early if we hit a server that doesn't have the key.   test for adding new servers to keyring   leader: initialize keyring after we have consistent reads   Wait until we're sure the FSM is current before we try to initialize the keyring. Also, if a key is rotated immediately following a leader election, plans that are in-flight may get signed before the new leader has the key. Allow for a short timeout-and-retry to avoid rejecting plans"
672,test: use port collision instead of cpu exhaustion (#14994),Originally this test relied on Job 1 blocking Job 2 until Job 1 had a terminal ClientStatus. Job 2 ensured it would get blocked using 2 mechanisms:  A constraint requiring it is placed on the same node as Job 1. Job 2 would require all unreserved CPU on the node to ensure it would    be blocked until Job 1's resources were free.  That 2nd assertion breaks if any previous job is still running on the target node! That seems very likely to happen in the flaky world of our e2e tests. In fact there may be some jobs we intentionally want running throughout; in hindsight it was never safe to assume my test would be the only thing scheduled when it ran. Ports to the rescue! Reserving a static port means that both Job 2 will now block on Job 1 being terminal. It will only conflict with other tests if those tests use that port on every node. I ensured no existing tests were using the port I chose. Other changes: - Gave job a bit more breathing room resource-wise. - Tightened timings a bit since previous failure ran into the go test   time limit. - Cleaned up the DumpEvals output. It's quite nice and handy now!

The cache TTL is configurable in the same manner as policies or tokens. Another small fix is included that takes into account the ACL token expiry time. This was not included, which meant tokens with expiry could be used past the expiry time, until they were GC'd."

713,docker_logger: reorder imports to save memory (#14875),"Nomad runs one logmon process and also one docker_logger process for each running allocation. A naive look at memory usage shows 10-30 MB of RSS, but a closer look shows that most of this memory (ex. all but ~2MB for logmon) is shared (Shared_Clean in Linux pmap). But a heap dump of docker_logger shows that it currently has an extra ~2500 KiB of heap (anonymously-mapped unshared memory) used for init blocks coming from the agent code (ex. mostly regexes from go-version, structs, and the Consul SDK). The packages for running logmon, docker_logger, and executor have an init block that parses os.Args to drop into their own logic, which prevents them from loading all the rest of the agent code and saves on memory, so this was unexpected. It looks like we accidentally reordered the imports in main to undo some of the work originally done in 404d2d4c98f1df930be1ae9852fe6e6ae8c1517e. This changeset restores the ordering. A follow-up heap dump shows this saves ~2MB of unshared RSS per docker_logger process."

This is causing validation problems elsewhere, e.g. when a group service using the Consul provider sets 'task' it will fail validation that worked previously. The assertion of leaving 'task' unset was only about making sure job submitters weren't expecting some behavior, but in practice is causing bugs now that we need the task field for more than it was originally added for. We can simply update the docs, noting when the task field set by job submitters actually has value."

In our experience, the problem is only rarely a regression; because failures   are complex, totally different code paths can result in symptoms that initially   appear to be the same but turn out to be completely different under close   examination. This is particularly the case for issues fixed in very old   versions (sometimes 2 or more years old).   The Terraform core team uses a bot that locks issues after only 30 days. But because we typically close issues automatically on PR merge but don't have rolling releases, it'd frequently happen that unrelease fixes will have locked comments, which isn't a good experience either. I've looked through the pace of releases since Nomad 0.9.0 and the longest window between releases was 3 months. Set the window for the lock bot to 120 days to give us plenty of breathing room so it doesn't feel like we're shutting down discussion prematurely."

The use case for disabling a periodic job in this way is to prevent it from running without modifying the schedule.

However, these should be suitable to use as points of conversation with expert end users. Included: * A description of Evaluation triggers and expected counts, with examples. * A description of Evaluation states and implicit states. This is taken from an   internal document in our team wiki. * A description of how writing the State Store works. This is taken from a   diagram I put together a few months ago for internal education purposes. * A description of Evaluation lifecycle, from registration to running   Allocations.

783,CSI: ensure initial unpublish state is checkpointed (#14675),"A test flake revealed a bug in the CSI unpublish workflow, where an unpublish that comes from a client that's successfully done the node-unpublish step will not have the claim checkpointed if the controller-unpublish step fails. This will result in a delay in releasing the volume claim until the next GC. This changeset also ensures we're using a new snapshot after each write to raft, and fixes two timing issues in test where either the volume watcher can unpublish before the unpublish RPC is sent or we don't wait long enough in resource-restricted environements like GHA."

787,client: recover from getter panics (#14696),The artifact getter uses the go-getter library to fetch files from different sources. Any bug in this library that results in a panic can cause the entire Nomad client to crash due to a single file download attempt. This change aims to guard against this types of crashes by recovering from panics when the getter attempts to download an artifact. The resulting panic is converted to an error that is stored as a task event for operator visibility and the panic stack trace is logged to the client's log.
788,fingerprint: lengthen Vault check after seen (#14693),"Extension of #14673 Once Vault is initially fingerprinted, extend the period since changes should be infrequent and the fingerprint is relatively expensive since it is contacting a central Vault server. Also move the period timer reset after the fingerprint. This is similar to #9435 where the idea is to ensure the retry period starts after the operation is attempted. 15s will be the minimum time between fingerprints now instead of the maximum time between fingerprints. In the case of Vault fingerprinting, the original behavior might cause the following:  Timer is reset to 15s Fingerprint takes 16s Timer has already elapsed so we immediately Fingerprint again  Even if fingerprinting Vault only takes a few seconds, that may very well be due to excessive load and backing off our fingerprints is desirable. The new bevahior ensures we always wait at least 15s between fingerprint attempts and should allow some natural jittering based on server load and network latency."

808,fingerprint: don't clear Consul/Vault attributes on failure (#14673),"Clients periodically fingerprint Vault and Consul to ensure the server has updated attributes in the client's fingerprint. If the client can't reach Vault/Consul, the fingerprinter clears the attributes and requires a node update. Although this seems like correct behavior so that we can detect intentional removal of Vault/Consul access, it has two serious failure modes: (1) If a local Consul agent is restarted to pick up configuration changes and the client happens to fingerprint at that moment, the client will update its fingerprint and result in evaluations for all its jobs and all the system jobs in the cluster. (2) If a client loses Vault connectivity, the same thing happens. But the consequences are much worse in the Vault case because Vault is not run as a local agent, so Vault connectivity failures are highly correlated across the entire cluster. A 15 second Vault outage will cause a new node-update evalution for every system job on the cluster times the number of nodes, plus one node-update evaluation for every non-system job on each node. On large clusters of 1000s of nodes, we've seen this create a large backlog of evaluations. This changeset updates the fingerprinting behavior to keep the last fingerprint if Consul or Vault queries fail. This prevents a storm of evaluations at the cost of requiring a client restart if Consul or Vault is intentionally removed from the client."

For collections that are typically large, instead emit newline-delimited JSON. This changeset includes some first-pass refactoring of this command. It breaks up monolithic methods that validate a path, create a file, serialize objects, and write them to disk into smaller functions, some of which can now be standalone to take advantage of generics."

899,CSI: failed allocation should not block its own controller unpublish (#14484),"A Nomad user reported problems with CSI volumes associated with failed allocations, where the Nomad server did not send a controller unpublish RPC. The controller unpublish is skipped if other non-terminal allocations on the same node claim the volume. The check has a bug where the allocation belonging to the claim being freed was included in the check incorrectly. During a normal allocation stop for job stop or a new version of the job, the allocation is terminal. But allocations that fail are not yet marked terminal at the point in time when the client sends the unpublish RPC to the server. For CSI plugins that support controller attach/detach, this means that the controller will not be able to detach the volume from the allocation's host and the replacement claim will fail until a GC is run. This changeset fixes the conditional so that the claim's own allocation is not included, and makes the logic easier to read. Include a test case covering this path. Also includes two minor extra bugfixes:   Entities we get from the state store should always be copied before altering. Ensure that we copy the volume in the top-level unpublish workflow before handing off to the steps.   The list stub object for volumes in nomad/structs did not match the stub object in api. The api package also did not include the current readers/writers fields that are expected by the UI. True up the two objects and add the previously undocumented fields to the docs. "

I think the tests were passing back them because of a bug in Raft (https://github.com/hashicorp/raft/pull/483) where a non-voting server was able to transition to candidate state. One possible evidence of this is that a successful test run would have the following log line: raft@v1.3.5/raft.go:1058: nomad.raft: updating configuration: command=AddVoter server-id=127.0.0.1:9101 server-addr=127.0.0.1:9101 servers=""[{Suffrage:Voter ID:127.0.0.1:9107 Address:127.0.0.1:9107} {Suffrage:Voter ID:127.0.0.1:9105 Address:127.0.0.1:9105} {Suffrage:Voter ID:127.0.0.1:9103 Address:127.0.0.1:9103} {Suffrage:Voter ID:127.0.0.1:9101 Address:127.0.0.1:9101}]"" This commit reverts the test logic to check for peer count, regardless of voting status."

This is a bit of security theatre for the current implementation, but it uses go-kms-wrapping as the interface for wrapping the key. This provides a shim for future support of external KMS such as cloud provider APIs or Vault transit encryption.   Removes the JSON serialization extension we had on the RootKey struct; this   struct is now only used for key replication and not for disk serialization, so   we don't need this helper.   Creates a helper for generating cryptographically random slices of bytes that   properly accounts for short reads from the source.   No observable functional changes outside of the on-disk format, so there are   no test updates. "

When Consul has namespaces enabled, we must iterate over each available namespace to be sure no services were leaked into non-default namespaces. Since this reconciliation happens often, there's no need to require results from the Consul leader server.

983,client: refactor cpuset manager initialization,"This PR refactors the code path in Client startup for setting up the cpuset cgroup manager (non-linux systems not affected). Before, there was a logic bug where we would try to read the cpuset.cpus.effective cgroup interface file before ensuring nomad's parent cgroup existed. Therefor that file would not exist, and the list of useable cpus would be empty. Tasks started thereafter would not have a value set for their cpuset.cpus. The refactoring fixes some less than ideal coding style. Instead we now bootstrap each cpuset manager type (v1/v2) within its own constructor. If something goes awry during bootstrap (e.g. cgroups not enabled), the constructor returns the noop implementation and logs a warning. Fixes #14229"

989,Task lifecycle restart (#14127)," allocrunner: handle lifecycle when all tasks die  When all tasks die the Coordinator must transition to its terminal state, coordinatorStatePoststop, to unblock poststop tasks. Since this could happen at any time (for example, a prestart task dies), all states must be able to transition to this terminal state.  allocrunner: implement different alloc restarts  Add a new alloc restart mode where all tasks are restarted, even if they have already exited. Also unifies the alloc restart logic to use the implementation that restarts tasks concurrently and ignores ErrTaskNotRunning errors since those are expected when restarting the allocation.  allocrunner: allow tasks to run again  Prevent the task runner Run() method from exiting to allow a dead task to run again. When the task runner is signaled to restart, the function will jump back to the MAIN loop and run it again. The task runner determines if a task needs to run again based on two new task events that were added to differentiate between a request to restart a specific task, the tasks that are currently running, or all tasks that have already run.  api/cli: add support for all tasks alloc restart  Implement the new -all-tasks alloc restart CLI flag and its API counterpar, AllTasks. The client endpoint calls the appropriate restart method from the allocrunner depending on the restart parameters used.   test: fix tasklifecycle Coordinator test   allocrunner: kill taskrunners if all tasks are dead   When all non-poststop tasks are dead we need to kill the taskrunners so we don't leak their goroutines, which are blocked in the alloc restart loop. This also ensures the allocrunner exits on its own.  taskrunner: fix tests that waited on WaitCh  Now that ""dead"" tasks may run again, the taskrunner Run() method will not return when the task finishes running, so tests must wait for the task state to be ""dead"" instead of using the WaitCh, since it won't be closed until the taskrunner is killed.   tests: add tests for all tasks alloc restart   changelog: add entry for #14127   taskrunner: fix restore logic.   The first implementation of the task runner restore process relied on server data (tr.Alloc().TerminalStatus()) which may not be available to the client at the time of restore. It also had the incorrect code path. When restoring a dead task the driver handle always needs to be clear cleanly using clearDriverHandle otherwise, after exiting the MAIN loop, the task may be killed by tr.handleKill. The fix is to store the state of the Run() loop in the task runner local client state: if the task runner ever exits this loop cleanly (not with a shutdown) it will never be able to run again. So if the Run() loops starts with this local state flag set, it must exit early. This local state flag is also being checked on task restart requests. If the task is ""dead"" and its Run() loop is not active it will never be able to run again.   address code review requests   apply more code review changes   taskrunner: add different Restart modes   Using the task event to differentiate between the allocrunner restart methods proved to be confusing for developers to understand how it all worked. So instead of relying on the event type, this commit separated the logic of restarting an taskRunner into two methods: - Restart will retain the current behaviour and only will only restart   the task if it's currently running. - ForceRestart is the new method where a dead task is allowed to   restart if its Run() method is still active. Callers will need to   restart the allocRunner taskCoordinator to make sure it will allow the   task to run again.  minor fixes"
990,vault: detect namespace change in config reload (#14298),"The namespace field was not included in the equality check between old and new Vault configurations, which meant that a Vault config change that only changed the namespace would not be detected as a change and the clients would not be reloaded. Also, the comparison for boolean fields such as enabled and allow_unauthenticated was on the pointer and not the value of that pointer, which results in spurious reloads in real config reload that is easily missed in typical test scenarios. Includes a minor refactor of the order of fields for Copy and Merge to match the struct fields in hopes it makes it harder to make this mistake in the future, as well as additional test coverage."

This presents a problem in situations where we would like to revert the state of a task, such as when restarting an allocation with tasks that have already exited. With this new implementation the task coordinator behaves more like a finite state machine where task may be blocked/unblocked multiple times by performing a state transition. This initial part of the work only refactors the task coordinator and is functionally equivalent to the previous implementation.

1033,client: fix data races in config handling (#14139),"Before this change, Client had 2 copies of the config object: config and configCopy. There was no guidance around which to use where (other than configCopy's comment to pass it to alloc runners), both are shared among goroutines and mutated in data racy ways. At least at one point I think the idea was to have config be mutable and then grab a lock to overwrite configCopy's pointer atomically. This would have allowed alloc runners to read their config copies in data race safe ways, but this isn't how the current implementation worked. This change takes the following approach to safely handling configs in the client:  Client.config is the only copy of the config and all access must go through the Client.configLock mutex Since the mutex only protects the config pointer itself and not fields inside the Config struct: all config mutation must be done on a copy of the config, and then Client's config pointer is overwritten while the mutex is acquired. Alloc runners and other goroutines with the old config pointer will not see config updates. Deep copying is implemented on the Config struct to satisfy the previous approach. The TLS Keyloader is an exception because it has its own internal locking to support mutating in place. An unfortunate complication but one I couldn't find a way to untangle in a timely fashion. To facilitate deep copying I made an internally backward incompatible API change: our helper/funcs used to turn containers (slices and maps) with 0 elements into nils. This probably saves a few memory allocations but makes it very easy to cause panics. Since my new config handling approach uses more copying, it became very difficult to ensure all code that used containers on configs could handle nils properly. Since this code has caused panics in the past, I fixed it: nil containers are copied as nil, but 0-element containers properly return a new 0-element container. No more ""downgrading to nil!"""

When resolving an ACL token, the policies linked from an ACL role are unpacked and combined with the policy array to form the complete auth set for the token. The ACL token creation endpoint handles deduplicating ACL role links as well as ensuring they exist within state. When reading a token, Nomad will also ensure the ACL role link is current.

Otherwise they may block forever if capacityChangeCh is full because it will never be received on again. I did not find evidence of this occurring in my meager smattering of prod goroutine dumps I have laying around, but this isn't surprising as the chan has a buffer of 8096! I would imagine that is sufficient to handle ""late"" sends and then just get GC'd away when the last reference to the old chan is dropped. This is just additional safety/correctness."

Unix sockets have a hard length limit and the driver implementation assumed that QEMU versions 2.10.1 were able to handle longer paths. This is not correct, the linked QEMU fix only changed the behaviour from silently truncating longer socket paths to throwing an error. By validating the socket path before starting the QEMU machine we can provide users a more actionable and meaningful error message, and by using a shorter socket file name we leave a bit more room for user-defined values in the path, such as the task name. The maximum length allowed is also platform-dependant, so validation needs to be different for each OS."

1239,docs: move checks into own page,"This PR creates a top-level 'check' page for job-specification docs. The content for checks is about half the content of the service page, and is about to increase in size when we add docs about Nomad service checks. Seemed like a good idea to just split the checks section out into its own thing (e.g. check_restart is already a topic). Doing the move first lets us backport this change without adding Nomad service check stuff yet. Mostly just a lift-and-shift but with some tweaked examples to de-emphasize the use of script checks."

1267,Track plan rejection history and automatically mark clients as ineligible (#13421),"Plan rejections occur when the scheduler work and the leader plan applier disagree on the feasibility of a plan. This may happen for valid reasons: since Nomad does parallel scheduling, it is expected that different workers will have a different state when computing placements. As the final plan reaches the leader plan applier, it may no longer be valid due to a concurrent scheduling taking up intended resources. In these situations the plan applier will notify the worker that the plan was rejected and that they should refresh their state before trying again. In some rare and unexpected circumstances it has been observed that workers will repeatedly submit the same plan, even if they are always rejected. While the root cause is still unknown this mitigation has been put in place. The plan applier will now track the history of plan rejections per client and include in the plan result a list of node IDs that should be set as ineligible if the number of rejections in a given time window crosses a certain threshold. The window size and threshold value can be adjusted in the server configuration. To avoid marking several nodes as ineligible at one, the operation is rate limited to 5 nodes every 30min, with an initial burst of 10 operations."

1269,core: merge reserved_ports into host_networks (#13651),"Fixes #13505 This fixes #13505 by treating reserved_ports like we treat a lot of jobspec settings: merging settings from more global stanzas (client.reserved.reserved_ports) ""down"" into more specific stanzas (client.host_networks[].reserved_ports). As discussed in #13505 there are other options, and since it's totally broken right now we have some flexibility: Treat overlapping reserved_ports on addresses as invalid and refuse to start agents. However, I'm not sure there's a cohesive model we want to publish right now since so much 0.9-0.12 compat code still exists! We would have to explain to folks that if their -network-interface and host_network addresses overlapped, they could only specify reserved_ports in one place or the other?! It gets ugly. Use the global client.reserved.reserved_ports value as the default and treat host_network[].reserverd_ports as overrides. My first suggestion in the issue, but @groggemans made me realize the addresses on the agent's interface (as configured by -network-interface) may overlap with host_networks, so you'd need to remove the global reserved_ports from addresses shared with a shared network?! This seemed really confusing and subtle for users to me. So I think ""merging down"" creates the most expressive yet understandable approach. I've played around with it a bit, and it doesn't seem too surprising. The only frustrating part is how difficult it is to observe the available addresses and ports on a node! However that's a job for another PR."

1316,workload identity (#13223),"In order to support implicit ACL policies for tasks to get their own secrets, each task would need to have its own ACL token. This would add extra raft overhead as well as new garbage collection jobs for cleaning up task-specific ACL tokens. Instead, Nomad will create a workload Identity Claim for each task. An Identity Claim is a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by the server’s private key and attached to an Allocation at the time a plan is applied. The encoded JWT can be submitted as the X-Nomad-Token header to replace ACL token secret IDs for the RPCs that support identity claims. Whenever a key is is added to a server’s keyring, it will use the key as the seed for a Ed25519 public-private private keypair. That keypair will be used for signing the JWT and for verifying the JWT. This implementation is a ruthlessly minimal approach to support the secure variables feature. When a JWT is verified, the allocation ID will be checked against the Nomad state store, and non-existent or terminal allocation IDs will cause the validation to be rejected. This is sufficient to support the secure variables feature at launch without requiring implementation of a background process to renew soon-to-expire tokens."

The helper function AllowNsOpFunc returns a function that can be used to make this verification.

The comment was changed from referring to only evictions to referring to ""all allocs"" in the first sentence and ""stop or evict"" in the second. This confuses every time I see it because I read the name (NodeUpdate) and first sentence (""all the allocs"") and assume this represents all allocations... which isn't true. I'm going to assume I'm the only one who doesn't read the 2nd sentence and that's why this suboptimal wording has lasted 7 years, but can we change it for my sake?"

1403,fix deadlock in plan_apply (#13407),"The plan applier has to get a snapshot with a minimum index for the plan it's working on in order to ensure consistency. Under heavy raft loads, we can exceed the timeout. When this happens, we hit a bug where the plan applier blocks waiting on the indexCh forever, and all schedulers will block in Plan.Submit. Closing the indexCh when the asyncPlanWait is done with it will prevent the deadlock without impacting correctness of the previous snapshot index. This changeset includes the a PoC failing test that works by injecting a large timeout into the state store. We need to turn this into a test we can run normally without breaking the state store before we can merge this PR. Increase snapshotMinIndex timeout to 10s. This timeout creates backpressure where any concurrent Plan.Submit RPCs will block waiting for results. This sheds load across all servers and gives raft some CPU to catch up, because schedulers won't dequeue more work while waiting. Increase it to 10s based on observations of large production clusters."

The csi_hook on the client will unpublish if the allocation has stopped and if the host is terminated there's no mount for the volume anyways.

1449,CSI: no early return when feasibility check fails on eligible nodes (#13274),"As a performance optimization in the scheduler, feasibility checks that apply to an entire class are only checked once for all nodes of that class. Other feasibility checks are ""available"" checks because they rely on more ephemeral characteristics and don't contribute to the hash for the node class. This currently includes only CSI. We have a separate fast path for ""available"" checks when the node has already been marked eligible on the basis of class. This fast path has a bug where it returns early rather than continuing the loop. This causes the entire task group to be rejected. Fix the bug by not returning early in the fast path and instead jump to the top of the loop like all the other code paths in this method. Includes a new test exercising topology at whole-scheduler level and a fix for an existing test that should've caught this previously."

(#13227),"When deleting evaluations and allocations during a reap event, the index table entries for evals and allocs was updated irregardless of whether changes were made. This change modifies the state logic so that the index table is only modified when the corresponding table has actually been modified. Along with matching expected behaviour, this change has the potential to reduce the number of times blocking queries will return without any real state change."

Approach Since Nomad has no ability to differentiate a DoS-via-large-artifact vs a legitimate workload, all of the new limits are configurable at the client agent level. The max size of HTTP downloads is also exposed as a node attribute so that if some workloads have large artifacts they can specify a high limit in their jobspecs. In the future all of this plumbing could be extended to enable/disable specific getters or artifact downloading entirely on a per-node basis."

After the release these files need to be reverted. For GA releases the following additional changes also need to happen:  version/version.go: the Version variable needs to be bumped to the     next version number. GNUMakefile: the LAST_RELEASE variable needs to be set to the     version that was just released.  Since the release process will commit file changes to the branch being used for the release, it should never run on main, so the first step is now to protect against that. It also adds a validation to make the user input version is correct. After looking at the different release options and steps I noticed that automatic CHANGELOG generation is actually the exception, so it would be better to have the default to be false."

1564,cgroups: make sure cgroup still exists after task restart,"This PR modifies raw_exec and exec to ensure the cgroup for a task they are driving still exists during a task restart. These drivers have the same bug but with different root cause. For raw_exec, we were removing the cgroup in 2 places - the cpuset manager, and in the unix containment implementation (the thing that uses freezer cgroup to clean house). During a task restart, the containment would remove the cgroup, and when the task runner hooks went to start again would block on waiting for the cgroup to exist, which will never happen, because it gets created by the cpuset manager which only runs as an alloc pre-start hook. The fix here is to simply not delete the cgroup in the containment implementation; killing the PIDs is enough. The removal happens in the cpuset manager later anyway. For exec, it's the same idea, except DestroyTask is called on task failure, which in turn calls into libcontainer, which in turn deletes the cgroup. In this case we do not have control over the deletion of the cgroup, so instead we hack the cgroup back into life after the call to DestroyTask. All of this only applies to cgroups v2."

1590,"[ui, mirage] Evaluation mocks (#12471)",  Linear and Branching mock evaluations   De-comment   test-trigger   Making evaluation trees dynamic   Reinstated job relationship on eval mock   Dasherize job prefix back to normal   Handle bug where UUIDKey is not present on job   Appending node to eval   Job ID as a passed property   Remove unused import   Branching evals set up as generatable 
1591,remove pre-0.9 driver code and related E2E test (#12791),This test exercises upgrades between 0.8 and Nomad versions greater than 0.9. We have not supported 0.8.x in a very long time and in any case the test has been marked to skip because the downloader doesn't work.
1592,client: fix waiting on preempted alloc (#12779),"Fixes #10200 The bug A user reported receiving the following error when an alloc was placed that needed to preempt existing allocs: [ERROR] client.alloc_watcher: error querying previous alloc: alloc_id=28... previous_alloc=8e... error=""rpc error: alloc lookup failed: index error: UUID must be 36 characters"" The previous alloc (8e) was already complete on the client. This is possible if an alloc stops after the scheduling decision was made to preempt it, but before the node running both allocations was able to pull and start the preemptor. While that is hopefully a narrow window of time, you can expect it to occur in high throughput batch scheduling heavy systems. However the RPC error made no sense! previous_alloc in the logs was a valid 36 character UUID! The fix The fix is: -       prevAllocID:  c.Alloc.PreviousAllocation, +       prevAllocID:  watchedAllocID, The alloc watcher new func used for preemption improperly referenced Alloc.PreviousAllocation instead of the passed in watchedAllocID. When multiple allocs are preempted, a watcher is created for each with watchedAllocID set properly by the caller. In this case Alloc.PreviousAllocation="""" -- which is where the UUID must be 36 characters error was coming from! Sadly we were properly referencing watchedAllocID in the log, so it made the error make no sense! The repro I was able to reproduce this with a dev agent with preemption enabled and lowered limits for ease of repro. First I started a low priority count 3 job, then a high priority job that evicts 2 low priority jobs. Everything worked as expected. However if I force it to use the remotePrevAlloc implementation, it reproduces the bug because the watcher references PreviousAllocation instead of watchedAllocID."

1594,E2E: remove old CLI for driving provisioning (#12787),"We moved off the old provisioning process for nightly E2E to one driven entirely by Terraform quite a while back now. We're in the slow process of removing the framework code for this test-by-test, but this chunk of code no longer has any callers."
1595,CSI: enforce one plugin supervisor loop via sync.Once (#12785),"We enforce exactly one plugin supervisor loop by checking whether running is set and returning early. This works but is fairly subtle. It can briefly result in two goroutines where one quickly exits before doing any work. Clarify the intent by using sync.Once. The goroutine we've spawned only exits when the entire task runner is being torn down, and not when the task driver restarts the workload, so it should never be re-run."

1599,docs: update json jobs docs (#12766)," docs: update json jobs docs  Did you know that Nomad has not 1 but 2 JSON formats for jobs? 2½ if you want to acknowledge that sometimes our JSON job representations have a Job top-level wrapper and sometimes do not. The 2½ formats are: 1.   HCL JSON  2.   Input API JSON (top-level Job field)  2.5. Output API JSON (lacks top-level Job field) #2 is what our docs consider our API JSON. #2.5 seems to be an accident of history we can't fix with breaking API compatibility. #1 is an even more interesting accident of history: the jobspec2 package automatically detects if the input to Parse is JSON and switches to a JSON parser. This behavior is undocumented, the format is unspecified, and there is no official HashiCorp tooling to produce this JSON from HCL. The plot thickens when you discover popular third party tools like hcl2json.com and https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json seem to produce JSON that nomad run accepts! Since we have no telemetry around whether or not anyone passes HCL JSON to nomad run, and people don't file bugs around features that Just Work, I'm choosing to leave that code path in place and acknowledged but not suggested in documentation. See https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/issues/498 for a more comprehensive discussion of what officially supporting HCL JSON in Nomad would look like. (I also added some of the missing fields to the (Input API flavor) JSON Job documentation, but it still needs a lot of work to be comprehensive.) Co-authored-by: Tim Gross tgross@hashicorp.com"

1603,CSI: plugin supervisor prestart should not mark itself done (#12752),"The task runner hook Prestart response object includes a Done field that's intended to tell the client not to run the hook again. The plugin supervisor creates mount points for the task during prestart and saves these mounts in the hook resources. But if a client restarts the hook resources will not be populated. If the plugin task restarts at any time after the client restarts, it will fail to have the correct mounts and crash loop until restart attempts run out. Fix this by not returning Done in the response, just as we do for the volume_mount_hook."

For most cases, the file will have an extension like .hcl and so there's little danger that a user will apply a file spec when they intended to apply a file name. But because directory names typically don't include an extension, you're much more likely to collide when trying to namespace apply by name only, and then you get a confusing error message of the form: Failed to read file: read $namespace: is a directory Detect the case where the namespace name collides with a directory in the current working directory, and skip trying to load the directory."

There's nothing CSI specific about marking plugin allocs healthy, as the plugin supervisor hook does all the fingerprinting in the postrun hook (the prestart hook just makes a couple of empty directories). The timeouts we're seeing may be because of where we're pulling the images from; most our jobs pull from a CDN-backed public registry whereas these are pulling from ECR. Set a 1min timeout for these to make sure we have enough time to pull the image and start the task."

1656,CSI: replace structs->api with serialization extension (#12583),"The CSI HTTP API has to transform the CSI volume to redact secrets, remove the claims fields, and to consolidate the allocation stubs into a single slice of alloc stubs. This was done manually in #8590 but this is a large amount of code and has proven both very bug prone (see #8659, #8666, #8699, #8735, and #12150) and requires updating lots of code every time we add a field to volumes or plugins. In #10202 we introduce encoding improvements for the Node struct that allow a more minimal transformation. Apply this same approach to serializing structs.CSIVolume to API responses. Also, the original reasoning behind #8590 for plugins no longer holds because the counts are now denormalized within the state store, so we can simply remove this transformation entirely."

Ensure the job is running before we try to get the index, so that we've given the event enough time to land in the buffer. Second, the assertion that the found index is greater than the start index is only true if the PlanResult event manages to land before we do the second registration. Although it should now with the first fix above, it's not a correct assertion for what we're testing."

1713,Fix flaky operator debug test (#12501),"We introduced a pprof-interval argument to operator debug in #11938, and unfortunately this has resulted in a lot of test flakes. The actual command in use is mostly fine (although I've fixed some quirks here), so what's really happened is that the change has revealed some existing issues in the tests. Summary of changes:   Make first pprof collection synchronous to preserve the existing   behavior for the common case where the pprof interval matches the   duration.   Clamp operator debug pprof timing to that of the command. The   pprof-duration should be no more than duration and the   pprof-interval should be no more than pprof-duration. Clamp the   values rather than throwing errors, which could change the commands   that existing users might already have in debugging scripts   Testing: remove test parallelism   The operator debug tests that stand up servers can't be run in   parallel, because we don't have a way of canceling the API calls for   pprof. The agent will still be running the last pprof when we exit,   and that breaks the next test that talks to that same agent.   (Because you can only run one pprof at a time on any process!) We could split off each subtest into its own server, but this test   suite is already very slow. In future work we should fix this ""for   real"" by making the API call cancelable.  Testing: assert against unexpected errors in operator debug tests.  If we assert there are no unexpected error outputs, it's easier for   the developer to debug when something is going wrong with the tests   because the error output will be presented as a failing test, rather   than just a failing exit code check. Or worse, no failing exit code   check! This also forces us to be explicit about which tests will return 0   exit codes but still emit (presumably ignorable) error outputs. Additional minor bug fixes (mostly in tests) and test refactorings:   Fix text alignment on pprof Duration in operator debug output   Remove ""done"" channel from operator debug event stream test. The   goroutine we're blocking for here already tells us it's done by   sending a value, so block on that instead of an extraneous channel   Event stream test timer should start at current time, not zero   Remove noise from operator debug test log output. The t.Logf   calls already are picked out from the rest of the test output by   being prefixed with the filename.   Remove explicit pprof args so we use the defaults clamped from   duration/interval "

1768,Support Vault entity aliases (#12449),"Move some common Vault API data struct decoding out of the Vault client so it can be reused in other situations. Make Vault job validation its own function so it's easier to expand it. Rename the Job.VaultPolicies method to just Job.Vault since it returns the full Vault block, not just their policies. Set ChangeMode on Vault.Canonicalize. Add some missing tests. Allows specifying an entity alias that will be used by Nomad when deriving the task Vault token. An entity alias assigns an indentity to a token, allowing better control and management of Vault clients since all tokens with the same indentity alias will now be considered the same client. This helps track Nomad activity in Vault's audit logs and better control over Vault billing. Add support for a new Nomad server configuration to define a default entity alias to be used when deriving Vault tokens. This default value will be used if the task doesn't have an entity alias defined."
1769,CSI: don't block client shutdown for node unmount (#12457),"When we unmount a volume we need to be able to recover from cases where the plugin has been shutdown before the allocation that needs it, so in #11892 we blocked shutting down the alloc runner hook. But this blocks client shutdown if we're in the middle of unmounting. The client won't be able to communicate with the plugin or send the unpublish RPC anyways, so we should cancel the context and assume that we'll resume the unmounting process when the client restarts. For -dev mode we don't send the graceful Shutdown() method and instead destroy all the allocations. In this case, we'll never be able to communicate with the plugin but also never close the context we need to prevent the hook from blocking. To fix this, move the retries into their own goroutine that doesn't block the main Postrun."

1777,CSI: volume watcher shutdown fixes (#12439),"The volume watcher design was based on deploymentwatcher and drainer, but has an important difference: we don't want to maintain a goroutine for the lifetime of the volume. So we stop the volumewatcher goroutine for a volume when that volume has no more claims to free. But the shutdown races with updates on the parent goroutine, and it's possible to drop updates. Fortunately these updates are picked up on the next core GC job, but we're most likely to hit this race when we're replacing an allocation and that's the time we least want to wait. Wait until the volume has ""settled"" before stopping this goroutine so that the race between shutdown and the parent goroutine sending on <-updateCh is pushed to after the window we most care about quick freeing of claims.   Fixes a resource leak when volumewatchers are no longer needed. The   volume is nil and can't ever be started again, so the volume's   watcher should be removed from the top-level Watcher.   De-flakes the GC job test: the test throws an error because the   claimed node doesn't exist and is unreachable. This flaked instead of   failed because we didn't correctly wait for the first pass through the   volumewatcher.   Make the GC job wait for the volumewatcher to reach the quiescent   timeout window state before running the GC eval under test, so that   we're sure the GC job's work isn't being picked up by processing one   of the earlier claims. Update the claims used so that we're sure the   GC pass won't hit a node unpublish error.  Adds trace logging to unpublish operations"

1808,CSI: reorder controller volume detachment (#12387),"In #12112 and #12113 we solved for the problem of races in releasing volume claims, but there was a case that we missed. During a node drain with a controller attach/detach, we can hit a race where we call controller publish before the unpublish has completed. This is discouraged in the spec but plugins are supposed to handle it safely. But if the storage provider's API is slow enough and the plugin doesn't handle the case safely, the volume can get ""locked"" into a state where the provider's API won't detach it cleanly. Check the claim before making any external controller publish RPC calls so that Nomad is responsible for the canonical information about whether a volume is currently claimed. This has a couple side-effects that also had to get fixed here:  Changing the order means that the volume will have a past claim   without a valid external node ID because it came from the client, and   this uncovered a separate bug where we didn't assert the external node   ID was valid before returning it. Fallthrough to getting the ID from   the plugins in the state store in this case. We avoided this   originally because of concerns around plugins getting lost during node   drain but now that we've fixed that we may want to revisit it in   future work. We should make sure we're handling FailedPrecondition cases from   the controller plugin the same way we handle other retryable cases. Several tests had to be updated because they were assuming we fail   in a particular order that we're no longer doing."
1809,template: disallow writeToFile by default,"Resolves #12095 by WONTFIXing it. This approach disables writeToFile as it allows arbitrary host filesystem writes and is only a small quality of life improvement over multiple template stanzas. This approach has the significant downside of leaving people who have altered their template.function_denylist still vulnerable! I added an upgrade note, but we should have implemented the denylist as a map[string]bool so that new funcs could be denied without overriding custom configurations. This PR also includes a bug fix that broke enabling all consul-template funcs. We repeatedly failed to differentiate between a nil (unset) denylist and an empty (allow all) one."

Nomad <= v1.2 expects the vsn tag to exist in Serf. It has always been 1. It has no functional purpose. However it causes a parsing error if it is not set: https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.2.6/nomad/util.go#L103-L108 This means Nomad servers at version v1.2 or older will not allow servers without this tag to join. The mvn minor version tag is also checked, but soft fails. I'm not setting that because I want as much of this cruft gone as possible."
1832,core: store and check for Raft version changes (#12362),"Downgrading the Raft version protocol is not a supported operation. Checking for a downgrade is hard since this information is not stored in any persistent place. When a server re-joins a cluster with a prior Raft version, the Serf tag is updated so Nomad can't tell that the version changed. Mixed version clusters must be supported to allow for zero-downtime rolling upgrades. During this it's expected that the cluster will have mixed Raft versions. Enforcing consistency strong version consistency would disrupt this flow. The approach taken here is to store the Raft version on disk. When the server starts the raft_protocol value is written to the file data_dir/raft/version. If that file already exists, its content is checked against the current raft_protocol value to detect downgrades and prevent the server from starting. Any other types of errors are ignore to prevent disruptions that are outside the control of operators. The only option in cases of an invalid or corrupt file would be to delete it, making this check useless. So just overwrite its content with the new version and provide guidance on how to check that their cluster is an expected state."

1840,client: enable support for cgroups v2,"This PR introduces support for using Nomad on systems with cgroups v2 [1] enabled as the cgroups controller mounted on /sys/fs/cgroups. Newer Linux distros like Ubuntu 21.10 are shipping with cgroups v2 only, causing problems for Nomad users. Nomad mostly ""just works"" with cgroups v2 due to the indirection via libcontainer, but not so for managing cpuset cgroups. Before, Nomad has been making use of a feature in v1 where a PID could be a member of more than one cgroup. In v2 this is no longer possible, and so the logic around computing cpuset values must be modified. When Nomad detects v2, it manages cpuset values in-process, rather than making use of cgroup heirarchy inheritence via shared/reserved parents. Nomad will only activate the v2 logic when it detects cgroups2 is mounted at /sys/fs/cgroups. This means on systems running in hybrid mode with cgroups2 mounted at /sys/fs/cgroups/unified (as is typical) Nomad will continue to use the v1 logic, and should operate as before. Systems that do not support cgroups v2 are also not affected. When v2 is activated, Nomad will create a parent called nomad.slice (unless otherwise configured in Client conifg), and create cgroups for tasks using naming convention -.scope. These follow the naming convention set by systemd and also used by Docker when cgroups v2 is detected. Client nodes now export a new fingerprint attribute, unique.cgroups.version which will be set to 'v1' or 'v2' to indicate the cgroups regime in use by Nomad. The new cpuset management strategy fixes #11705, where docker tasks that spawned processes on startup would ""leak"". In cgroups v2, the PIDs are started in the cgroup they will always live in, and thus the cause of the leak is eliminated.

But plugins written in other languages (democratic-csi for example) may have more strictly conforming gRPC server libraries and we need to set the authority header manually."

The iterator used for pagination must still return results in some order so that the paginator can properly handle requests where the next_token value is not present in the results anymore (e.g., the eval was GC'ed). In these situations, the paginator will start the returned page in the first element right after where the requested token should've been. This commit moves the logic to generate pagination tokens from the elements being paginated to the iterator itself so that callers can have more control over the token format to make sure they are properly ordered and stable. It also allows configuring the paginator as being ordered in ascending or descending order, which is relevant when looking for a token that may not be present anymore."

2003,CSI: enforce usage at claim time (#12112),"  Remove redundant schedulable check in FreeWriteClaims. If a volume   has been created but not yet claimed, its capabilities will be checked   in WriteSchedulable at both scheduling time and claim time. We don't   need to also check them in the FreeWriteClaims method.   Enforce maximum volume claims for writers.   When the scheduler checks feasibility for CSI volumes, the check is   fairly loose: earlier versions of the same job are not counted as   active claims. This allows the scheduler to place new allocations   for the new version of a job, under the assumption that we'll replace   the existing allocations and their volume claims. But when the alloc runner claims the volume, we need to enforce the   active claims even if they're for allocations of an earlier version of   the job. Otherwise we'll try to mount a volume that's currently being   unmounted, and this will cause replacement allocations to frequently   fail.  Enforce single-node reader check for read-only volumes. When the   alloc runner makes a claim for a read-only volume, we only check that   the volume is potentially schedulable and not that it actually has   free read claims."

Update the data structure for the dynamic registry so that more recent allocations take over as the instance manager singleton, but we still preserve the previous running allocations so that restores work without racing. Multiple allocations can run on a client for the same plugin, even if only during updates. Provide each plugin task a unique path for the control socket so that the tasks don't interfere with each other."

2024,docs: add changelog for #11600,
2025,core: remove all traces of unused protocol version,"Nomad inherited protocol version numbering configuration from Consul and Serf, but unlike those projects Nomad has never used it. Nomad's protocol_version has always been 1. While the code is effectively unused and therefore poses no runtime risks to leave, I felt like removing it was best because:  Nomad's RPC subsystem has been able to evolve extensively without    needing to increment the version number. Nomad's HTTP API has evolved extensively without increment    API{Major,Minor}Version. If we want to version the HTTP API in the    future, I doubt this is the mechanism we would choose. The presence of the server.protocol_version configuration    parameter is confusing since server.raft_protocol is an important    parameter for operators to consider. Even more confusing is that    there is a distinct Serf protocol version which is included in nomad    server members output under the heading Protocol. raft_protocol    is the only protocol version relevant to Nomad developers and    operators. The other protocol versions are either deadcode or have    never changed (Serf). If we were to need to version the RPC, HTTP API, or Serf protocols, I    don't think these configuration parameters and variables are the best    choice. If we come to that point we should choose a versioning scheme    based on the use case and modern best practices -- not this 6+ year    old dead code."

2030,connect: bootstrap envoy using -proxy-id,"This PR modifies the Consul CLI arguments used to bootstrap envoy for Connect sidecars to make use of '-proxy-id' instead of '-sidecar-for'. Nomad registers the sidecar service, so we know what ID it has. The '-sidecar-for' was intended for use when you only know the name of the service for which the sidecar is being created. The improvement here is that using '-proxy-id' does not require an underlying request for listing Consul services. This will make make the interaction between Nomad and Consul more efficient. Closes #10452"
2031,connect: write envoy bootstrap debugging info,"When Consul Connect just works, it's wonderful. When it doesn't work it can be exceeding difficult to debug: operators have to check task events, Nomad logs, Consul logs, Consul APIs, and even then critical information is missing. Using Consul to generate a bootstrap config for Envoy is notoriously difficult. Nomad doesn't even log stderr, so operators are left trying to piece together what went wrong. This patch attempts to provide maximal context which unfortunately includes secrets. Secrets are always restricted to the secrets/ directory. This makes debugging a little harder, but allows operators to know exactly what operation Nomad was trying to perform. What's added:  stderr is sent to alloc/logs/envoy_bootstrap.stderr.0 the CLI is written to secrets/.envoy_bootstrap.cmd the environment is written to secrets/.envoy_bootstrap.env as JSON  Accessing this information is unfortunately awkward: nomad alloc exec -task connect-proxy-count-countdash b36a cat secrets/.envoy_bootstrap.env nomad alloc exec -task connect-proxy-count-countdash b36a cat secrets/.envoy_bootstrap.cmd nomad alloc fs b36a alloc/logs/envoy_bootstrap.stderr.0 The above assumes an alloc id that starts with b36a and a Connect sidecar proxy for a service named count-countdash.

2063,CSI: make gRPC client creation more robust (#12057),"Nomad communicates with CSI plugin tasks via gRPC. The plugin supervisor hook uses this to ping the plugin for health checks which it emits as task events. After the first successful health check the plugin supervisor registers the plugin in the client's dynamic plugin registry, which in turn creates a CSI plugin manager instance that has its own gRPC client for fingerprinting the plugin and sending mount requests. If the plugin manager instance fails to connect to the plugin on its first attempt, it exits. The plugin supervisor hook is unaware that connection failed so long as its own pings continue to work. A transient failure during plugin startup may mislead the plugin supervisor hook into thinking the plugin is up (so there's no need to restart the allocation) but no fingerprinter is started.  Refactors the gRPC client to connect on first use. This provides the   plugin manager instance the ability to retry the gRPC client   connection until success. Add a 30s timeout to the plugin supervisor so that we don't poll   forever waiting for a plugin that will never come back up.  Minor improvements: * The plugin supervisor hook creates a new gRPC client for every probe   and then throws it away. Instead, reuse the client as we do for the   plugin manager. * The gRPC client constructor has a 1 second timeout. Clarify that this   timeout applies to the connection and not the rest of the client   lifetime."

2095,scheduler: prevent panic in spread iterator during alloc stop,"The spread iterator can panic when processing an evaluation, resulting in an unrecoverable state in the cluster. Whenever a panicked server restarts and quorum is restored, the next server to dequeue the evaluation will panic. To trigger this state: * The job must have max_parallel = 0 and a canary >= 1. * The job must not have a spread block. * The job must have a previous version. * The previous version must have a spread block and at least one   failed allocation. In this scenario, the desired changes include (place 1+) (stop 1+), (ignore n) (canary 1). Before the scheduler can place the canary allocation, it tries to find out which allocations can be stopped. This passes back through the stack so that we can determine previous-node penalties, etc. We call SetJob on the stack with the previous version of the job, which will include assessing the spread block (even though the results are unused). The task group spread info state from that pass through the spread iterator is not reset when we call SetJob again. When the new job version iterates over the groupPropertySets, it will get an empty spreadAttributeMap, resulting in an unexpected nil pointer dereference. This changeset resets the spread iterator internal state when setting the job, logging with a bypass around the bug in case we hit similar cases, and a test that panics the scheduler without the patch."

Nomad must create a new Client object on every artifact download, as the Client object controls the Src and Dst among other things. When Caling Client.Get, the Getter modifies its own Client reference, creating the circular reference and race condition. We can still achieve most of the desired connection caching behavior by re-using a shared HTTP client with transport pooling enabled."

2100,CSI: use job status not alloc status for plugin updates from summary (#12027),"When an allocation is updated, the job summary for the associated job is also updated. CSI uses the job summary to set the expected count for controller and node plugins. We incorrectly used the allocation's server status instead of the job status when deciding whether to update or remove the job from the plugins. This caused a node drain or other terminal state for an allocation to clear the expected count for the entire plugin. Use the job status to guide whether to update or remove the expected count. The existing CSI tests for the state store incorrectly modeled the updates we received from servers vs those we received from clients, leading to test assertions that passed when they should not. Rework the tests to clarify each step in the lifecycle and rename CSI state store functions for clarity"

This means that developers can't take a given state snapshot and pass an evaluation through it and be guaranteed the same plan results. But the evaluation ID is already random, so if we use this as the seed for shuffling the nodes we can greatly reduce the sources of non-determinism. Unfortunately golang map iteration uses a global source of randomness and not a goroutine-local one, but arguably if the scheduler behavior is impacted by this, that's a bug in the iteration."

2114,scheduler: recover from panic (#12009),"If processing a specific evaluation causes the scheduler (and therefore the entire server) to panic, that evaluation will never get a chance to be nack'd and cleared from the state store. It will get dequeued by another scheduler, causing that server to panic, and so forth until all servers are in a panic loop. This prevents the operator from intervening to remove the evaluation or update the state. Recover the goroutine from the top-level Process methods for each scheduler so that this condition can be detected without panicking the server process. This will lead to a loop of recovering the scheduler goroutine until the eval can be removed or nack'd, but that's much better than taking a downtime."

2118,fix mTLS certificate check on agent to agent RPCs (#11998),"PR #11956 implemented a new mTLS RPC check to validate the role of the certificate used in the request, but further testing revealed two flaws:  client-only endpoints did not accept server certificates so the      request would fail when forwarded from one server to another. the certificate was being checked after the request was forwarded,      so the check would happen over the server certificate, not the      actual source.  This commit checks for the desired mTLS level, where the client level accepts both, a server or a client certificate. It also validates the cercertificate before the request is forwarded."

2159,CSI: node unmount from the client before unpublish RPC (#11892),"When an allocation stops, the csi_hook makes an unpublish RPC to the servers to unpublish via the CSI RPCs: first to the node plugins and then the controller plugins. The controller RPCs must happen after the node RPCs so that the node has had a chance to unmount the volume before the controller tries to detach the associated device. But the client has local access to the node plugins and can independently determine if it's safe to send unpublish RPC to those plugins. This will allow the server to treat the node plugin as abandoned if a client is disconnected and stop_on_client_disconnect is set. This will let the server try to send unpublish RPCs to the controller plugins, under the assumption that the client will be trying to unmount the volume on its end first. Note that the CSI NodeUnpublishVolume/NodeUnstageVolume RPCs can  return ignorable errors in the case where the volume has already been unmounted from the node. Handle all other errors by retrying until we get success so as to give operators the opportunity to reschedule a failed node plugin (ex. in the case where they accidentally drained a node without -ignore-system). Fan-out the work for each volume into its own goroutine so that we can release a subset of volumes if only one is stuck."
2160,CSI: move terminal alloc handling into denormalization (#11931), The volume claim GC method and volumewatcher both have logic collecting terminal allocations that duplicates most of the logic that's now in the state store's CSIVolumeDenormalize method. Copy this logic into the state store so that all code paths have the same view of the past claims. Remove logic in the volume claim GC that now lives in the state store's CSIVolumeDenormalize method. Remove logic in the volumewatcher that now lives in the state store's CSIVolumeDenormalize method. Remove logic in the node unpublish RPC that now lives in the state store's CSIVolumeDenormalize method.
2161,csi: ensure that PastClaims are populated with correct mode (#11932),"In the client's (*csiHook) Postrun() method, we make an unpublish RPC that includes a claim in the CSIVolumeClaimStateUnpublishing state and using the mode from the client. But then in the (*CSIVolume) Unpublish RPC handler, we query the volume from the state store (because we only get an ID from the client). And when we make the client RPC for the node unpublish step, we use the current volume's view of the mode. If the volume's mode has been changed before the old allocations can have their claims released, then we end up making a CSI RPC that will never succeed. Why does this code path get the mode from the volume and not the claim? Because the claim written by the GC job in (*CoreScheduler) csiVolumeClaimGC doesn't have a mode. Instead it just writes a claim in the unpublishing state to ensure the volumewatcher detects a ""past claim"" change and reaps all the claims on the volumes. Fix this by ensuring that the CSIVolumeDenormalize creates past claims for all nil allocations with a correct access mode set."
2162,CSI: resolve invalid claim states (#11890)," csi: resolve invalid claim states on read  It's currently possible for CSI volumes to be claimed by allocations that no longer exist. This changeset asserts a reasonable state at the state store level by registering these nil allocations as ""past claims"" on any read. This will cause any pass through the periodic GC or volumewatcher to trigger the unpublishing workflow for those claims.  csi: make feasibility check errors more understandable  When the feasibility checker finds we have no free write claims, it checks to see if any of those claims are for the job we're currently scheduling (so that earlier versions of a job can't block claims for new versions) and reports a conflict if the volume can't be scheduled so that the user can fix their claims. But when the checker hits a claim that has a GCd allocation, the state is recoverable by the server once claim reaping completes and no user intervention is required; the blocked eval should complete. Differentiate the scheduler error produced by these two conditions."
2163,csi: update leader's ACL in volumewatcher (#11891),"The volumewatcher that runs on the leader needs to make RPC calls rather than writing to raft (as we do in the deploymentwatcher) because the unpublish workflow needs to make RPC calls to the clients. This requires that the volumewatcher has access to the leader's ACL token. But when leadership transitions, the new leader creates a new leader ACL token. This ACL token needs to be passed into the volumewatcher when we enable it, otherwise the volumewatcher can find itself with a stale token."

2185,client: change test to not poke cgroupv2 edge case,"This PR tweaks the TestCpusetManager_AddAlloc unit test to not break when being run on a machine using cgroupsv2. The behavior of writing an empty cpuset.cpu changes in cgroupv2, where such a group now inherits the value of its parent group, rather than remaining empty. The test in question was written such that a task would consume all available cores shared on an alloc, causing the empty set to be written to the shared group, which works fine on cgroupsv1 but breaks on cgroupsv2. By adjusting the test to consume only 1 core instead of all cores, it no longer triggers that edge case. The actual fix for the new cgroupsv2 behavior will be in #11933"

2206,fix integer bounds checks (#11815)," driver: fix integer conversion error  The shared executor incorrectly parsed the user's group into int32 and then cast to uint32 without bounds checking. This is harmless because an out-of-bounds gid will throw an error later, but it triggers security and code quality scans. Parse directly to uint32 so that we get correct error handling.  helper: fix integer conversion error  The autopilot flags helper incorrectly parses a uint64 to a uint which is machine specific size. Although we don't have 32-bit builds, this sets off security and code quality scaans. Parse to the machine sized uint.  driver: restrict bounds of port map  The plugin server doesn't constrain the maximum integer for port maps. This could result in a user-visible misconfiguration, but it also triggers security and code quality scans. Restrict the bounds before casting to int32 and return an error.  cpuset: restrict upper bounds of cpuset values  Our cpuset configuration expects values in the range of uint16 to match the expectations set by the kernel, but we don't constrain the values before downcasting. An underflow could lead to allocations failing on the client rather than being caught earlier. This also make security and code quality scanners happy.  http: fix integer downcast for per_page parameter  The parser for the per_page query parameter downcasts to int32 without bounds checking. This could result in underflow and nonsensical paging, but there's no server-side consequences for this. Fixing this will silence some security and code quality scanners though."

2283,deps: adjust to gzip handler zero length response body,"After swapping gzip handler to use the gorilla library, we must account for a quirk in how zero/minimal length response bodies are delivered. The previous gzip handler was configured to compress all responses regardless of size - even if the data was zero length or below the network MTU. This behavior changed in v1.1.0 which is why we could not upgrade. The Nomad HTTP Client mutates the http.Response.Body object, making a strong assumption that if the Content-Encoding header is set to ""gzip"", the response will be readable via gzip decoder. This is no longer true for the nytimes gzip handler, and is also not true for the gorilla gzip handler. It seems in practice this only makes a difference on the /v1/operator/license endpoint which returns an empty response in OSS Nomad. The fix here is to simply not wrap the response body reader if we encounter an io.EOF while creating the gzip reader - indicating there is no data to decode."
2284,deps: swap gzip handler for gorilla,"This has been pinned since the Go modules migration, because the nytimes gzip handler was modified in version v1.1.0 in a way that is no longer compatible. Pretty sure it is this commit: https://github.com/nytimes/gziphandler/commit/c551b6c3b4b976eafa1a18220b5e21692784d8e2 Instead use handler.CompressHandler from gorilla, which is a web toolkit we already make use of for other things."

2342,Un-break templates when using vault stanza change_mode noop (#11783),"Templates in nomad jobs make use of the vault token defined in the vault stanza when issuing credentials like client certificates. When using change_mode ""noop"" in the vault stanza, consul-template is not informed in case a vault token is re-issued (which can happen from time to time for various reasons, as described in https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/vault). As a result, consul-template will keep using the old vault token to renew credentials and - once the token expired - stop renewing credentials. The symptom of this problem is a vault_token file that is newer than the issued credential (e.g., TLS certificate) in a job's /secrets directory. This change corrects this, so that h.updater.updatedVaultToken(token) is called, which will inform stakeholders about the new token and make sure, the new token is used by consul-template. Example job template fragment: vault {     policies = [""nomad-job-policy""]     change_mode = ""noop"" }  template {   data = <<-EOH     {{ with secret ""pki_int/issue/nomad-job""     ""common_name=myjob.service.consul"" ""ttl=90m""     ""alt_names=localhost"" ""ip_sans=127.0.0.1""}}     {{ .Data.certificate }}     {{ .Data.private_key }}     {{ .Data.issuing_ca }}     {{ end }}   EOH   destination = ""${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}/myjob.crt""   change_mode = ""noop"" }  This fix does not alter the meaning of the three change modes of vault  ""noop"" - Take no action ""restart"" - Restart the job ""signal"" - send a signal to the task  as the switch statement following line 232 contains the necessary logic. It is assumed that ""take no action"" was never meant to mean ""don't tell consul-template about the new vault token"".

2377,scheduler: fix quadratic performance with spread blocks (#11712),"When the scheduler picks a node for each evaluation, the LimitIterator provides at most 2 eligible nodes for the MaxScoreIterator to choose from. This keeps scheduling fast while producing acceptable results because the results are binpacked. Jobs with a spread block (or node affinity) remove this limit in order to produce correct spread scoring. This means that every allocation within a job with a spread block is evaluated against all eligible nodes. Operators of large clusters have reported that jobs with spread blocks that are eligible on a large number of nodes can take longer than the nack timeout to evaluate (60s). Typical evaluations are processed in milliseconds. In practice, it's not necessary to evaluate every eligible node for every allocation on large clusters, because the RandomIterator at the base of the scheduler stack produces enough variation in each pass that the likelihood of an uneven spread is negligible. Note that feasibility is checked before the limit, so this only impacts the number of eligible nodes available for scoring, not the total number of nodes. This changeset sets the iterator limit for ""large"" spread block and node affinity jobs to be equal to the number of desired allocations. This brings an example problematic job evaluation down from ~3min to ~10s. The included tests ensure that we have acceptable spread results across a variety of large cluster topologies."

Provide a -no-shutdown-delay flag on the nomad alloc stop and nomad job stop commands that bypasses the delay. This sets a new desired transition state on the affected allocations that the allocation/task runner will identify during pre-kill on the client.

In the meantime callers can get the X-Nomad-NextToken. Add pagination to the Eval.List RPC by checking for pagination token and page size in QueryOptions. This will allow resuming from the last ID seen so long as the query parameters and the state store itself are unchanged between requests. Add filtering by job ID or evaluation status over the results we get out of the state store. Parse the query parameters of the Eval.List API into the arguments expected for filtering in the RPC call."

This param is optional and override the use of the job priority to set the eval priority. In order to ensure all evaluations as a result of the request use the same eval priority, the priority is shared to the allocReconciler and deploymentWatcher. This creates a new distinction between eval priority and job priority. The Nomad agent HTTP API has been modified to allow setting the eval priority on job update and delete. To keep consistency with the current v1 API, job update accepts this as a payload param; job delete accepts this as a query param. Any user supplied value is validated within the agent HTTP handler removing the need to pass invalid requests to the server. The register and deregister opts functions now all for setting the eval priority on requests. The change includes a small change to the DeregisterOpts function which handles nil opts. This brings the function inline with the RegisterOpts."

2632,rpc: set the deregistration eval priority to the job priority.,"Previously when creating an eval for job deregistration, the eval priority was set to the default value irregardless of the job priority. In situations where an operator would want to deregister a high priority job so they could re-register; the evaluation may get blocked for some time on a busy cluster because of the deregsiter priority. If a job had a lower than default priority and was deregistered, the deregister eval would get a priority higher than that of the job. If we attempted to register another job with a higher priority than this, but still below the default, the deregister would be actioned before the register. Both situations described above seem incorrect and unexpected from a user prespective. This fix modifies to behaviour to set the deregister eval priority to that of the job, if available. Otherwise the default value is still used."

2647,logging: Log the cause behind agent startup failure (#11353),"Log the failure error when the agent fails to start. Previously, the agent startup failure error would be emitted to the command UI but not logged. So it doesn't get emitted to syslog or log_file if they are set, and it makes debugging much harder. Also, logging the error again before exit makes the error more visible: previously, the operator needed to scroll to the top to find the error. On a sample failure, the output will look like: ==> WARNING: Bootstrap mode enabled!

The conditions are a bit complicated: A job with higher priority that schedule multiple allocations that preempt other multiple allocations on the same node, due to port/network/device assignments. The cause of the bug is incidental mutation of internal cached data. RankedNode computes and cache proposed allocations  in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.1.6/scheduler/rank.go#L42-L53 . But scheduler then mutates the list to remove pre-emptable allocs in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.1.6/scheduler/rank.go#L293-L294, and  RemoveAllocs mutates and sets the tail of cached slice with nils triggering a nil-pointer derefencing case. I fixed the issue by avoiding the mutation in RemoveAllocs - the micro-optimization there doesn't seem necessary. Fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/11342"

2680,client: never embed alloc_dir in chroot,"Fixes #2522 Skip embedding client.alloc_dir when building chroot. If a user configures a Nomad client agent so that the chroot_env will embed the client.alloc_dir, Nomad will happily infinitely recurse while building the chroot until something horrible happens. The best case scenario is the filesystem's path length limit is hit. The worst case scenario is disk space is exhausted. A bad agent configuration will look something like this: ```hcl data_dir = ""/tmp/nomad-badagent"" client {   enabled = true chroot_env {     # Note that the source matches the data_dir     ""/tmp/nomad-badagent"" = ""/ohno""     # ...   } } ``` Note that /ohno/client (the state_dir) will still be created but not /ohno/alloc (the alloc_dir). While I cannot think of a good reason why someone would want to embed Nomad's client (and possibly server) directories in chroots, there should be no cause for harm. chroots are only built when Nomad runs as root, and Nomad disables running exec jobs as root by default. Therefore even if client state is copied into chroots, it will be inaccessible to tasks. Skipping the data_dir and {client,server}.state_dir is possible, but this PR attempts to implement the minimum viable solution to reduce risk of unintended side effects or bugs. When running tests as root in a vm without the fix, the following error occurs: === RUN   TestAllocDir_SkipAllocDir     alloc_dir_test.go:520:                 Error Trace:    alloc_dir_test.go:520                 Error:          Received unexpected error:                                 Couldn't create destination file /tmp/TestAllocDir_SkipAllocDir1457747331/001/nomad/test/testtask/nomad/test/testtask/.../nomad/test/testtask/secrets/.nomad-mount: open /tmp/TestAllocDir_SkipAllocDir1457747331/001/nomad/test/.../testtask/secrets/.nomad-mount: file name too long                 Test:           TestAllocDir_SkipAllocDir --- FAIL: TestAllocDir_SkipAllocDir (22.76s) Also removed unused Copy methods on AllocDir and TaskDir structs.

Logmon FileRotator buffers the task stdout/stderr streams and periodically flushing them to log files. Logmon creates a new FileRotator for each stream for each task run. However, the flushPeriodically goroutine is leaked when a task restarts, holding a reference to a no-longer-needed FileRotator instance along with its 64kb buffer. The cause is that the code assumed time.Ticker.Stop() closes the ticker channel, thereby terminating the goroutine, but the documentation says otherwise:  Stop turns off a ticker. After Stop, no more ticks will be sent. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a concurrent goroutine reading from the channel from seeing an erroneous ""tick"". https://pkg.go.dev/time#Ticker.Stop"

2791,allow configuration of Docker hostnames in bridge mode (#11173),"Add a new hostname string parameter to the network block which allows operators to specify the hostname of the network namespace. Changing this causes a destructive update to the allocation and it is omitted if empty from API responses. This parameter also supports interpolation. In order to have a hostname passed as a configuration param when creating an allocation network, the CreateNetwork func of the DriverNetworkManager interface needs to be updated. In order to minimize the disruption of future changes, rather than add another string func arg, the function now accepts a request struct along with the allocID param. The struct has the hostname as a field. The in-tree implementations of DriverNetworkManager.CreateNetwork have been modified to account for the function signature change. In updating for the change, the enhancement of adding hostnames to network namespaces has also been added to the Docker driver, whilst the default Linux manager does not current implement it."

This changes the conditional logic to check for a wildcard namespace instead of an empty one.

Currently, if client fingerprinting is fast and finishes before the client connect to a server, node registration may be delayed by 15 seconds or so! Ideally, we'd wait until the client discovers the servers and then retry immediately, but that requires significant code changes. Here, we simply retry the node registration request every second. That's basically the equivalent of check if the client discovered servers every second. Should be a cheap operation. When testing this change on my local computer and where both servers and clients are co-located, the time from startup till node registration dropped from 34 seconds to 8 seconds!"

For long lived gRPC connections the proxy could reasonably expect to stay open until the context was cancelled. For the HTTP connections used by connect native tasks, we experience connection disconnects. The proxy gets recreated as needed on follow up requests, however we also emit a WARN log when the connection is broken. This PR lowers the WARN to a TRACE, because these disconnects are to be expected. Ideally we would be able to proxy at the HTTP layer, however Consul or the connect native task could be configured to expect mTLS, preventing Nomad from MiTM the requests. We also can't mange the proxy lifecycle more intelligently, because we have no control over the HTTP client or server and how they wish to manage connection state. What we have now works, it's just noisy. Fixes #10933"

Like the name implies, sysbatch can be thought of as a hybrid between system and batch jobs - it is for running short lived jobs intended to run on every compatible node in the cluster. As with batch jobs, sysbatch jobs can also be periodic and/or parameterized dispatch jobs. A sysbatch job is considered complete when it has been run on all compatible nodes until reaching a terminal state (success or failed on retries). Feasibility and preemption are governed the same as with system jobs. In this PR, the update stanza is not yet supported. The update stanza is sill limited in functionality for the underlying system scheduler, and is not useful yet for sysbatch jobs. Further work in #4740 will improve support for the update stanza and deployments. Closes #2527"

2925,api: revert to defaulting to http/1 (#10958)," api: revert to defaulting to http/1  PR #10778 incidentally changed the api http client to connect with HTTP/2 first. However, the websocket libraries used in alloc exec features don't handle http/2 well, and don't downgrade to http/1 gracefully. Given that the switch is incidental, and not requested by users. Furthermore, api consumers can opt-in to forcing http/2 by setting custom http clients. Fixes #10922"

2930,nomad: only activate one-time auth tokens with 1.1.0 (#10952),"Fix a panic in handling one-time auth tokens, used to support nomad ui --authenticate. If the nomad leader is a 1.1.x with some servers running as 1.0.x, the pre-1.1.0 servers risk crashing and the cluster may lose quorum. That can happen when nomad authenticate -ui command is issued, or when the leader scans for expired tokens every 10 minutes. Fixed #10943 ."

2932,Update client.mdx,"Missing ""-"" symbol, ""bridge_ Network name"" should be ""bridge_ network_name""."
2933,edit fuzzy search callback logic,"Namespaces are set-up in Nomad to be an object that has an id property. However, namespaces actually don't have that shape. Our search was expecting a namespace object, but we actually don't have a namespace assigned to jobs in our config and namespace is set to null. Normally, these namespaces would be set to default, but that would require us to refactor our Mirage config if we wanted to assert that namespaces are 'default' and not null. So this is a bandaid solution."
2934,Merge pull request #10931 from hashicorp/b-hcl1-backport-fields,"Support the new post-1.0.0 job spec fields in the HCLv1 parser. The HCLv1 parser is still the default (or only!) parser in many downstream tools, e.g. Levant, and terraform-provider-nomad . While we initially intended to deprecate HCLv1 parser in 1.0.0, we never communicated that publicly. We did not fully anticipate the public usage of jobspec package (we assumed it's a private package), or the friction that HCLv2 introduced in some cases (e.g. https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/10777, https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/9838). So moving forward we intend to ensure that new job spec fields are honored in both the HCLv1 and HCLv2 parser until we solidify the migration path and communicate it properly."

2936,cli: Use glint to determine if os.Stdout is tty (#10926),"Use glint to determine if os.Stdout is a terminal. glint Terminal renderer expects os.Stdout not only to be a terminal, but also to have non-zero size. It's unclear how this condition arises, but this additional check causes Nomad to render deployments progress through glint when glint cannot support it. By using golint to perform the check, we eliminate the risk of mis-judgement."

2960,refactoring for same regression in job versions,"In job versions, if you have an ACL token with a write policy you should be able to revert a job, however, that was not the case here. This is because we're using ember-can to check if the user can run a job. That permission relies on policiesSupportRunning which uses a function called namespaceIncludesCapability. We're going to need to refactor any cases that use this function."
2961,client: avoid acting on stale data after launch (#10907),"When the client launches, use a consistent read to fetch its own allocs, but allow stale read afterwards as long as reads don't revert into older state. This change addresses an edge case affecting restarting client. When a client restarts, it may fetch a stale data concerning its allocs: allocs that have completed prior to the client shutdown may still have ""run/running"" desired/client status, and have the client attempt to re-run again. An alternative approach is to track the indices such that the client set MinQueryIndex on the maximum index the client ever saw, or compare received allocs against locally restored client state. Garbage collection complicates this approach (local knowledge is not complete), and the approach still risks starting ""dead"" allocations (e.g. the allocation may have been placed when client just restarted and have already been reschuled by the time the client started. This approach here is effective against all kinds of stalness problems with small overhead."

2994,add name property back to agent schema in ember mirage,The name property had to be added back to the agent schema in the Agent Factory because the /agent/monitor endpoint in the config finds agents by their names and since member is not a proper entity in our Mirage Config we can't just findBy name of the member. So although we're following the correct schema we're set-up to rely on this.
2995,Handle successful/canceled/blocked deployments in CLI output,"Otherwise the spinner would just end, which felt a bit awkward. I wanted to see a  ""✓"" to know that everything was ok, and a ""!"" (maybe something else?) if something went wrong."
2996,consul/connect: fix bug causing high cpu with multiple connect sidecars in group,"This PR fixes a bug where the underlying Envoy process of a Connect gateway would consume a full core of CPU if there is more than one sidecar or gateway in a group. The utilization was being caused by Consul injecting an envoy_ready_listener on 127.0.0.1:8443, of which only one of the Envoys would be able to bind to. The others would spin in a hot loop trying to bind the listener. As a workaround, we now specify -address during the Envoy bootstrap config step, which is how Consul maps this ready listener. Because there is already the envoy_admin_listener, and we need to continue supporting running gateways in host networking mode, and in those case we want to use the same port value coming from the service.port field, we now bind the admin listener to the 127.0.0.2 loop-back interface, and the ready listener takes 127.0.0.1. This shouldn't make a difference in the 99.999% use case where envoy is being run in its official docker container. Advanced users can reference ${NOMAD_ENVOY_ADMIN_ADDR_} (as they 'ought to) if needed, as well as the new variable ${NOMAD_ENVOY_READY_ADDR_} for the envoy_ready_listener."

3007,cli: -namespace should override job namespace,"When a jobspec doesn't include a namespace, we provide it with the default namespace, but this ends up overriding the explicit -namespace flag. This changeset uses the same logic as region parsing to create an order of precedence: the query string parameter (the -namespace flag) overrides the API request body which overrides the jobspec."

3009,consul/connect: Avoid assumption of parent service when filtering connect proxies,This PR uses regex-based matching for sidecar proxy services and checks when syncing with Consul. Previously we would check if the parent of the sidecar was still being tracked in Nomad. This is a false invariant - one which we must not depend when we make #10845 work. Fixes #10843

Alloc logs currently accepts either, but alloc signal and restart only accept task as an arg. This adds -task as a flag to the other alloc commands to make the cli UX consistent. If task is passed as a flag and an arg, it ignores the arg."
3021,consul: avoid extra sync operations when no action required,"This PR makes it so the Consul sync logic will ignore operations that do not specify an action to take (i.e. [de-]register [services|checks]). Ideally such noops would be discarded at the callsites (i.e. users of [Create|Update|Remove]Workload], but we can also be defensive at the commit point. Also adds 2 trace logging statements which are helpful for diagnosing sync operations with Consul - when they happen and why. Fixes #10797"

3030,consul: avoid triggering unnecessary sync when removing workload,"There are bits of logic in callers of RemoveWorkload on group/task cleanup hooks which call RemoveWorkload with the ""Canary"" version of the workload, in case the alloc is marked as a Canary. This logic triggers an extra sync with Consul, and also doesn't do the intended behavior - for which no special casing is necessary anyway. When the workload is marked for removal, all associated services and checks will be removed regardless of the Canary status, because the service and check IDs do not incorporate the canary-ness in the first place. The only place where canary-ness matters is when updating a workload, where we need to compute the hash of the services and checks to determine whether they have been modified, the Canary flag of which is a part of that. Fixes #10842"
3031,Adopt go-changelog in Nomad (#10825),"Adopts go-changelog for managing Nomad's changelog. go-changelog is becoming the HashiCorp defacto standard tool for managing changelog, e.g. Consul, Vault, Waypoint. Consul seems to be the first product to adopt it, and its PR has the most context - though I've updated .changelog/README.md with the relevant info here. Changes to developers workflow When opening PRs, developers should add a changelog entry in .changelog/<PR#>.txt. Check .changelog/README.md.  For the WIP release, entries can be amended even after the PR merged, and new files may be added post-hoc (e.g. during transition period, missed accidentally, community PRs, etc). Transitioning Pending PRs can start including the changelog entry files immediately. For 1.1.3/1.0.9 cycle, the release coordinator should create the entries for any PR that gets merged without a changelog entry file. They should also move any 1.1.3 entry in CHANGELOG.md to a changelog entry file, as this PR done for GH-10818. Changes to release process Before cutting a release, release coordinator should update the changelog by inserting the output of make changelog to CHANGELOG.md with appropriate headers. See .changelog/README.md for more details. Details go-changelog is a basic templating engine for maintaining changelog in HashiCorp environment. It expects the changelog entries as files indexed by their PR number. The CLI generates the changelog section for a release by comparing two git references (e.g. HEAD and the latest release, e.g. v1.1.2), and still requires manual process for updating CHANGELOG.md and final formatting. The approach has many nice advantages: * Avoids changelog related merge conflicts: Each PR touches different file! * Copes with amendments and post-PR updates: Just add or update a changelog entry file using the original PR numbers. * Addresses the release backporting scenario: Cherry-picking PRs will cherry-pick the relevant changelog entry automatically! * Only relies on data available through git - no reliance on GitHub metadata or require GitHub credentials The approach has few downsides though: * CHANGELOG.md going stale during development and must be updated manually before cutting the release   * Repository watchers can no longer glance at the CHANGELOG.md to see upcoming changes   * We can periodically update the file, but go-changelog tool does not aid with that * go-changelog tool does not offer good error reporting. If an entry is has an invalid tag (e.g. uses release-note:bugfix instead of release-note:bug), the entry will be dropped silently   * We should update go-changelog to warn against unexpected entry tags   * TODO: Meanwhile, PR reviewers and release coordinators should watch out Potential follow ups We should follow up with CI checks to ensure PR changes include a warning. I've opted not to include that now. We still make many non-changelog-worth PRs for website/docs, for large features that get merged in multiple small PRs. I did not want to include a check that fails often. Also, we should follow up to have go-changelog emit better warnings on unexpected tag."

3034,Don't treat a failed recover + successful destroy as a successful,"recover This code just seems incorrect. As it stands today it reports a successful restore if RecoverTask fails and then DestroyTask succeeds. This can result in a really annoying bug where it then calls RecoverTask again, whereby it will probably get ErrTaskNotFound and call DestroyTask once more. I think the only reason this has not been noticed so far is because most drivers like Docker will return Success, then nomad will call RecoverTask, get an error (not found) and call DestroyTask again, and get a ErrTasksNotFound err."

The fix is to check if upstreams have been modified between Nomad's view of the sidecar service definition, and the service definition for the sidecar that is actually registered in Consul. Fixes #8754"
3085,docker: generate /etc/hosts file for bridge network mode (#10766),"When network.mode = ""bridge"", we create a pause container in Docker with no networking so that we have a process to hold the network namespace we create in Nomad. The default /etc/hosts file of that pause container is then used for all the Docker tasks that share that network namespace. Some applications rely on this file being populated. This changeset generates a /etc/hosts file and bind-mounts it to the container when Nomad owns the network, so that the container's hostname has an IP in the file as expected. The hosts file will include the entries added by the Docker driver's extra_hosts field. In this changeset, only the Docker task driver will take advantage of this option, as the exec/java drivers currently copy the host's /etc/hosts file and this can't be changed without breaking backwards compatibility. But the fields are available in the task driver protobuf for community task drivers to use if they'd like."

This adds a check to make sure a deployment exists before monitoring. Also fixes some formatting. Co-authored-by: Tim Gross tgross@hashicorp.com"
3098,deployment watcher: Reuse allocsCh if allocIndex remains the same (#10756),"Fix deployment watchers to avoid creating unnecessary deployment watcher goroutines and blocking queries. deploymentWatcher.getAllocsCh creates a new goroutine that makes a blocking query to fetch updates of deployment allocs. Background When operators submit a new or updated service job, Nomad create a new deployment by default. The deployment object controls how fast to place the allocations through max_parallel and health checks configurations. The scheduler and deploymentwatcher package collaborate to achieve deployment logic: The scheduler only places the canaries and max_parallel allocations for a new deployment; the deploymentwatcher monitors for alloc progress and then enqueues a new evaluation whenever the scheduler should reprocess a job and places the next max_parallel round of allocations. The deploymentwatcher package makes blocking queries against the state store, to fetch all deployments and the relevant allocs for each running deployments. If deploymentwatcher fails or is hindered from fetching the state, the deployments fail to make progress. Deploymentwatcher logic only runs on the leader. Why unnecessary deployment watchers can halt cluster progress Previously, getAllocsCh is called on every for loop iteration in deploymentWatcher.watch() function. However, the for-loop may iterate many times before the allocs get updated. In fact, whenever a new deployment is created/updated/deleted, all deploymentWatchers get notified through w.deploymentUpdateCh. The getAllocsCh goroutines and blocking queries spike significantly and grow quadratically with respect to the number of running deployments. The growth leads to two adverse outcomes:  it spikes the CPU/Memory usage resulting potentially leading to OOM or very slow processing it activates the query rate limiter, so later the watcher fails to get updates and consequently fails to make progress towards placing new allocations for the deployment!  So the cluster fails to catch up and fails to make progress in almost all deployments. The cluster recovers after a leader transition: the deposed leader stops all watchers and free up goroutines and blocking queries; the new leader recreates the watchers without the quadratic growth and remaining under the rate limiter.  Well, until a spike of deployments are created triggering the condition again. Relevant Code References Path for deployment monitoring: * Watcher.watchDeployments loops waiting for deployment updates. * On every deployment update, w.getDeploys returns all deployments in the system * watchDeployments calls w.add(d) on every active deployment * which in turns, updates existing watcher if one is found. * The deployment watcher updates local local deployment field and trigger deploymentUpdateCh channel * The deployment watcher deploymentUpdateCh selector is activated. Most of the time the selector clause is a no-op, because the flow was triggered due to another deployment update * The watch for-loop iterates again and in the previous code we create yet another goroutine and blocking call that risks being rate limited.

3099,edit the computed agent version property,"This PR edits the computed agent version that is returned upon hitting the agent self request endpoint. The reason is because we believe that the Agent Member Tag property sometimes returns null because we may have cases where there are only clients and no servers and only servers are included in the Serf Gossip Protocol. There may be other cases where we do in fact have servers but the node is erased for some reason. We are unsure how to replicate that issue, however. edit mirage config This commit updates the Mirage Config because our acceptance tests depend on the Mirage Config, while we rely on Mirage Factories to populate fixture data for us to use when to run the Nomad UI locally Revert ""update the open-button disability functionality depending on a job's state"" This reverts commit 5190b308a51d55a7b0617854164c155d36d7e513."

3102,quotas: evaluate quota feasibility last in scheduler (#10753),"The QuotaIterator is used as the source of nodes passed into feasibility checking for constraints. Every node that passes the quota check counts the allocation resources agains the quota, and as a result we count nodes which will be later filtered out by constraints. Therefore for jobs with constraints, nodes that are feasibility checked but fail have been counted against quotas. This failure mode is order dependent; if all the unfiltered nodes happen to be quota checked first, everything works as expected. This changeset moves the QuotaIterator to happen last among all feasibility checkers (but before ranking). The QuotaIterator will never receive filtered nodes so it will calculate quotas correctly."

3117,deflake TestNomad_BootstrapExpect and other leader tests,"The test fails reliably locally on my machine. The test uses non-dev mode where Raft actions get committed to disk, causing operations to exceed the 50ms tight Raft deadlines. So, here we ensure that non-dev servers use default Raft config files with longer timeouts. Also, noticed that the test queries a server, that may a follower with a stale state. I've updated the test to ensure we query the leader for its state. The Barrier call ensures that the leader is a ""stable"" leader with committed entries. Protects against a window where a new leader reports the previous term before it commits a raft log entry."
3118,tests: deflake TestAgentProfile_RemoteClient,"TestAgentProfile_RemoteClient test must wait for the client node to be registered in raft state store, and not merely that the server has a network connection from the client. In https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/15539/workflows/8dcbc3f3-946b-4da0-b089-9093788bc0c9/jobs/147919, notice how node registration complete log line occured after the test already have failed. This is another case of flakiness due to not waiting for client registration."
3119,tests: deflake TestMonitor_Monitor_RemoteServer and cross-region tests,"Ensure that all servers are joined to each other before test proceed, instead of just joining them to the first server and relying on background serf propagation. Relying on backgorund serf propagation is a cause of flakiness, specially for tests with multiple regions. The server receiving the RPC may not be aware of the region and fail to forward RPC accordingly. For example, consider TestMonitor_Monitor_RemoteServer failure in https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/16402/workflows/7f327235-7d0c-40ba-9757-600522afca51/jobs/158045  you can observe: * nomad-117 is joined to nomad-118 and nomad-119 * nomad-119 is the foreign region * nomad-117 gains leadership in the default region, nomad-118 is the non-leader *  search logs for nomad: adding server and notice that nomad-118    only added nomad-118 and nomad-118, but not nomad-119! * so the query to the non-leader in the test fails to be forwarded to   the appopriate region."
3120,tests: deflake CSI forwarding tests,"This updates client.Ready() so it returns once the client node got registered at the servers. Previously, it returns when the fingerprinters first batch completes, wtihout ensuring that the node is stored in the Raft data. The tests may fail later when it with unknown node errors later. client.Reedy() seem to be only called in CSI and some client stats now. This class of bug, assuming client is registered without checking, is a source of flakiness elsewhere. Other tests use other mechanisms for checking node readiness, though not consistently."

3131,cli: add monitor flag to deployment status,"Adding '-verbose' will print out the allocation information for the deployment. This also changes the job run command so that it now blocks until deployment is complete and adds timestamps to the output so that it's more in line with the output of node drain. This uses glint to print in place in running in a tty. Because glint doesn't yet support cmd/powershell, Windows workflows use a different library to print in place, which results in slightly different formatting: 1) different margins, and 2) no spinner indicating deployment in progress."

The most important thing about the metric is what we're waiting on    before taking a snapshot: the raft index of the object to be    processed (plan or eval).  The new description tries to cram all of that context into the tiny space provided. See #5791 for details about the wait_for_index mechanism in general."

Nomad v1.1.0 introduced a regression where Nomad would fail the validation when submitting Connect jobs and allow_unauthenticated set to true, with Consul OSS - because it would do the namespace check against the Consul ACL token assuming the ""default"" namespace, which does not work because Consul OSS does not have namespaces.

3155,consul: probe consul namespace feature before using namespace api,"This PR changes Nomad's wrapper around the Consul NamespaceAPI so that it will detect if the Consul Namespaces feature is enabled before making a request to the Namespaces API. Namespaces are not enabled in Consul OSS, and require a suitable license to be used with Consul ENT. Previously Nomad would check for a 404 status code when makeing a request to the Namespaces API to ""detect"" if Consul OSS was being used. This does not work for Consul ENT with Namespaces disabled, which returns a 500. Now we avoid requesting the namespace API altogether if Consul is detected to be the OSS sku, or if the Namespaces feature is not licensed. Since Consul can be upgraded from OSS to ENT, or a new license applied, we cache the value for 1 minute, refreshing on demand if expired. Fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-enterprise/issues/575 Note that the ticket originally describes using attributes from https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/10688. This turns out not to be possible due to a chicken-egg situation between bootstrapping the agent and setting up the consul client. Also fun: the Consul fingerprinter creates its own Consul client, because there is no [currently] no way to pass the agent's client through the fingerprint factory."

3170,consul/connect: add support for connect mesh gateways,"This PR implements first-class support for Nomad running Consul Connect Mesh Gateways. Mesh gateways enable services in the Connect mesh to make cross-DC connections via gateways, where each datacenter may not have full node interconnectivity. Consul docs with more information: https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway The following group level service block can be used to establish a Connect mesh gateway. service {   connect {     gateway {       mesh {         // no configuration       }     }   } } Services can make use of a mesh gateway by configuring so in their upstream blocks, e.g. service {   connect {     sidecar_service {       proxy {         upstreams {           destination_name = """"           local_bind_port  =            datacenter       = """"           mesh_gateway {             mode = """"           }         }       }     }   } } Typical use of a mesh gateway is to create a bridge between datacenters. A mesh gateway should then be configured with a service port that is mapped from a host_network configured on a WAN interface in Nomad agent config, e.g. client {   host_network ""public"" {     interface = ""eth1""   } } Create a port mapping in the group.network block for use by the mesh gateway service from the public host_network, e.g. network {   mode = ""bridge""   port ""mesh_wan"" {     host_network = ""public""   } } Use this port label for the service.port of the mesh gateway, e.g. service {   name = ""mesh-gateway""   port = ""mesh_wan""   connect {     gateway {       mesh {}     }   } } Currently Envoy is the only supported gateway implementation in Consul. By default Nomad client will run the latest official Envoy docker image supported by the local Consul agent. The Envoy task can be customized by setting meta.connect.gateway_image in agent config or by setting the connect.sidecar_task block. Gateways require Consul 1.8.0+, enforced by the Nomad scheduler.

Having this attribute available will enable Nomad to schedule Connect tasks only on nodes with a Consul agent that has the grpc listener enabled.

The PR itself exercised test code which had not been hit before. The particular problem is when identifying whether the event received is a heartbeat; this was performed using standard Golang conditionals. Unfortunately the operator == is not defined on byte arrays, resulting in the check always returning false. To overcome this issue the code now uses the bytes.Equal function to correctly compare the data."

These options replicate the functionality already present in the docker task driver. Important: this change also reduces the default set of capabilities enabled by the exec driver to match the default set enabled by the docker driver. Until v1.0.5 the exec task driver would enable all capabilities supported by the operating system. v1.0.5 removed NET_RAW from that list of default capabilities, but left may others which could potentially also be leveraged by compromised tasks. Important: the ""root"" user is still special cased when used with the exec driver. Older versions of Nomad enabled enabled all capabilities supported by the operating system for tasks set with the root user. To maintain compatibility with existing clusters we continue supporting this ""feature"", however we maintain support for the legacy set of capabilities rather than enabling all capabilities now supported on modern operating systems."

This issue affect to raw_exec driver, as noted in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/10430 . We fix this issue by ensuring that the TaskRunner only calls driver.WaitTask once. The TaskRunner monitors the completion of the task by calling driver.WaitTask which should return the task exit code on completion. However, it also could return a ""context canceled"" error if the agent/executor is shutdown. Previously, when a task is to be stopped, the killTask path makes two WaitTask calls, and the second returns ""context canceled"" occasionally because of a ""race"" in task shutting down and depending on driver, and how fast it shuts down after task completes. By having a single WaitTask call and consistently waiting for the task, we ensure we capture the exit code reliably before the executor is shutdown or the contexts expired. I opted to change the TaskRunner implementation to avoid changing the driver interface or requiring 3rd party drivers to update. Additionally, the PR ensures that attempts to kill the task terminate when the task ""naturally"" dies. Without this change, if the task dies at the right moment, the killTask call may retry to kill an already-dead task for up to 5 minutes before giving up."

This PR adds a scheduler configuration field to control memory oversubscription. It's additional field that can be set in the API via Scheduler Config, or the agent server config. I opted to have the memory oversubscription be an opt-in, but happy to change it.  To enable it, operators should call the API with: json {   ""MemoryOversubscriptionEnabled"": true } If memory oversubscription is disabled, submitting jobs specifying memory_max will get a ""Memory oversubscription is not enabled"" warnings, but the jobs will be accepted without them accessing the additional memory. The warning message is like: ``` $ nomad job run /tmp/j Job Warnings: 1 warning(s):  Memory oversubscription is not enabled; Task cache.redis memory_max value will be ignored  ==> Monitoring evaluation ""7c444157""     Evaluation triggered by job ""example"" ==> Monitoring evaluation ""7c444157""     Evaluation within deployment: ""9d826f13""     Allocation ""aa5c3cad"" created: node ""9272088e"", group ""cache""     Evaluation status changed: ""pending"" -> ""complete"" ==> Evaluation ""7c444157"" finished with status ""complete"" then you can examine the Alloc AllocatedResources to validate whether the task is allowed to exceed memory: $ nomad alloc status -json aa5c3cad | jq '.AllocatedResources.Tasks[""redis""].Memory' {   ""MemoryMB"": 256,   ""MemoryMaxMB"": 0 } ```"

It doesn’t use everything returned by the API: * deployments and evaluations: these match by id, doesn’t seem like   people would know those or benefit from quick navigation to them * namespaces: doesn’t seem useful as they currently function * scaling policies * tasks: the response doesn’t include an allocation id, which means they   can’t be navigated to in the UI without an additional query * CSI volumes: aren’t actually returned by the API Since there’s no API to check the server configuration and know whether the feature has been disabled, this adds another query in route:application#beforeModel that acts as feature detection: if the attempt to query fails (500), the global search field is hidden. Upon having added another query on load, I realised that beforeModel was being triggered any time service:router#transitionTo was being called, which happens upon navigating to a search result, for instance, because of refreshModel being present on the region query parameter. This PR adds a check for transition.queryParamsOnly and skips rerunning the onload queries (token permissions check, license check, fuzzy search feature detection). Implementation notes:  there are changes to unrelated tests to ignore the on-load feature   detection query some lifecycle-related guards against undefined were required to   address failures when navigating to an allocation the minimum search length of 2 characters is hard-coded as there’s   currently no way to determine min_term_length in the UI"

3372,api: /v1/jobs always include namespaces (#10434),"Add Namespace as a top-level field in /v1/jobs stub. The /v1/jobs endpoint already includes the namespace under JobSummary, though the API is odd, as typically the job ID and Namespace are in the same level, and the oddity complicates the UI frontend development. The downside of adding it is redundant field, that makes the response body a bit bigger, specially for clusters with large jobs. Though, it should compress nicely and I expect the overhead to be small to overall response size. The benefit of a cleaner and more consistent API seem worth it. Fixes #10431"
3373,api: Ignore User provided ParentID (#10424),"ParentID is an internal field that Nomad sets for dispatched or parameterized jobs. Job submitters should not be able to set it directly, as that messes up children tracking. Fixes #10422 . It specifically stops the scheduler from honoring the ParentID. The reason failure and why the scheduler didn't schedule that job once it was created is very interesting and requires follow up with a more technical issue."

In released binaries, we use code-generated msgpack serializers to improve performance.  However, in development, code generated serializers are a pain. If a developer forgets to re-generate code, the code generated gets out of sync with the go structs, and result into subtle bugs where some values appear not to persist as expected. The CI and release scripts will continue to use the msgpack code-generation. Devs who want to test locally can set GO_TAGS=codegen_generated as well."

3567,Add exchange of one-time token on UI load (#10066),"This adds UI support for receiving the one-time token passed via query parameter, as in #10134 and related PRs, and exchanging it for its corresponding secret ID. When this works, it’s mostly invisible, with a brief flash of the OTT onscreen. The authentication failure message now suggests the -authenticate flag. When OTT exchange fails, it shows a whole-page error. This includes a known UX shortcoming in that the OTT will not disappear from the URL when an identifier is specified on the command line, like nomad ui -authenticate jobname. The goal is to address that shortcoming in a forthcoming pull request."

This fixes a bug in Ceph support where the plugin can only suport create/delete but we assume that it also supports attach/detach."
3580,CSI: volume creation/registration should not validate attachment,"The CSI specification requires that we validate a list of Capability (access mode + accessibility) when we create volume, but the existing volume registration workflow incorrectly validates a single capability. The specific capability required by a volume claim is checked at the time we make the claim, so remove the check for AttachmentMode/AcccessMode."

3628,Update to v4 of Ember Power Select (#10226),"This closes #10146. Because of cibernox/ember-power-select#1203, which documents the current impossibility of attaching test selectors to a PowerSelect invocation, this uses test selectors on parent containers instead, occasionally adding wrappers when needed. I chose to leave the existing test selectors in the hopes that we can return to using them eventually, but I could easily remove them if it seems like extra noise now. Presumably for the same reason, @class no longer works, so this adjusts the scoping of global search CSS to preserve the style of the search control. I also included an update to the latest version of ember-test-selectors, since we were far behind and I tried that before finding the aforelinked issue. Finally, this replaces ember-cli-uglify with ember-cli-terser to address production build failures as described at ember-cli/ember-cli#9290."

3637,periodic: always reset periodic children status,"Fixes a bug where Nomad reports negative or incorrect running children counts for periodic jobs. The periodic dispatcher derives a child job without reseting the status. If the periodic job has a running status, the derived job will start as running status and transition to pending.  Since this is unexpected transition, the counting in StateStore.setJobSummary gets out of sync and result in negative/incorrect values. Note that this only affects periodic jobs after a leader transition. During the first job registration, the job is added with pending or """" status. However, after a leader transition, the new leader repopulates the dispatcher heap with ""running"" status and triggers the bug."

3656,Refactor stats-time-series to allow for multiple series,
3657,Sort and index multi-series data correctly in line chart, Sorting must be done on copies to preserve orders. Indices should be reversed since rendering is also reversed (the back    layer (the tallest) is rendered first to create the stacking effect).
3658,Stacked percentages of tasks for alloc charts,This leverages the existing pre-processing being done in the allocation-stats-tracker to also create additive percentages relative to the allocation resources vs. the task resources. This can then be used in a chart to create a stacked area representation of consumption.
3659,Simple bind helper,"This binds a function to a target before passing it along to another component. It's normal to expect to get to use this within functions on components and controllers, but (sans actions) that doesn't happen automatically."

This can result in random failure to fail feasibility checking, depending on how the map of volumes was being ordered at runtime. Remove the early return from the feasibility check. Add a test to verify that missing volumes in the map will cause a failure; this test will not catch a regression every test run because of the random map ordering, but any failure will be caught over the course of several CI runs."

When the deployment is promoted, if group A is done it will not contribute to the next deadline cutoff. Group B's old deadline will be used instead, which will be in the past and immediately trigger a deployment progress failure. Reset the progress deadline when the job is promotion to avoid this bug, and to better conform with implicit user expectations around how the progress deadline should interact with promotions."

Nomad would directly compare the tags between its copy of the sidecar service definition and the tags of the sidecar service reported by Consul. This does not work, because Consul will under-the-hood set the sidecar service tags to inherit the parent service tags if the sidecar service tags are unset. The comparison then done by Nomad would not match, if the parent sidecar tags are set. Fixes #10025"

It can be read commit-by-commit, though many of them are mechanical and skimmable. For the new linting exclusions, I’ve added them to the Tech Debt list. The decrease in test count is because linting is no longer included in ember test.

Since two tasks are created for this module, it’s only a 1% chance of no CPU task, but that means 1% flakiness!"

Before we would check that sidecar_task had not been set (indicating that something other than envoy may be in use, which would not support envoy's expose feature). However Consul has not added support for anything other than envoy and probably never will, so having the restriction in place seems like an unnecessary hindrance. If Consul ever does support something other than Envoy, they will likely find a way to provide the expose feature anyway. Fixes #9854"
3874,Fix exec escaping for emoji task name (#7813),"This closes #7459. While emoji don’t actually need escaping, expanding the expression that enumerates all task name characters that don’t need escaping to include emoji is prohibitive, since it’s a discontinuous range. The emoji-regex project has such an expression and it’s 12kB. This fixes the regular expression to property escape emoji as a single character instead of as its component bytes.

For example, block attribute identifiers may not contain dots, ., which frequently used in meta fields, and sometimes in environment variable fields. By adding attribute syntax support, we maintain backward compatibility and relax the block attribute key restrictions. This change attempts to parse env/meta both as an attribute and as a block. Additionally, the change allows better expressivity for env/meta blocks, using functions and for expressions. For example, one can reuse a set of environment variables for multiple tasks, using a local common_envs value: hcl env = merge(local.common_envs, {""more_env_key"", ""...""}) Note that the map/attribute compatibility workaround is currently a pattern we recommend for driver config blocks: https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/hcl2#blocks . :( Sadly, the document isn't accurate, as only meta appearing inside driver config was handled in 1.0.1.

We were previously using 33a6cfb after the maintainer merged my PR to allow the comment to be read from a file, there was no released version with that, but it’s now included in v2.0.0."
3989,e2e: Disable Connect tests,"The connect tests are very disruptive: restart consul/nomad agents with new tokens.  The test seems particularly flaky, failing 32 times out of 73 in my sample. The tests are particularly problematic because they are disruptive and affect other tests. On failure, the nomad or consul agent on the client can get into a wedged state, so health/deployment info in subsequent tests may be wrong. In some cases, the node will be deemed as fail, and then the subsequent tests may fail when the node is deemed lost and the test allocations get migrated unexpectedly."
3990,e2e: deflake nodedrain test,"The nodedrain deadline test asserts that all allocations are migrated by the deadline. However, when the deadline is short (e.g. 10s), the test may fail because of scheduler/client-propagation delays. In one failing test, it took ~15s from the RPC call to the moment to the moment the scheduler issued migration update, and then 3 seconds for the alloc to be stopped. Here, I increase the timeouts to avoid such false positives."
3991,e2e: vault increase timeout,"Increase the timeout for vaultsecrets.  As the default  interval is 0.1s, 10 retries mean it only retries for one second, a very short time for some waiting scenarios in the test (e.g. starting allocs, etc)."
3992,e2e: prefer testutil.WaitForResultRetries,"Prefer testutil.WaitForResultRetries that emits more descriptive errors on failures. require.Evatually fails with opaque ""Condition never satisfied"" error message."
3993,"e2e: special case ""Unexpected EOF"" errors","This is an attempt at deflaking the e2e exec tests, and a way to improve messages. e2e occasionally fail with ""unexpected EOF"" even though the exec output matches expectations. I suspect there is a race in handling EOF in server/http handling. Here, we special case this error and ensures we get all failures, to help debug the case better."
3994,e2e: tweak failure messages,"Tweak the error messages for the flakiest tests, so that on test failure, we get more output"
3995,e2e: use testify requires instead of t.Fatal,testify requires offer better error message that is easier to notice when seeing a wall of text in the builds.

4003,Merge pull request #9798 from hashicorp/e2e-terraform-tweaks-20200113,"This PR makes two ergonomics changes, meant to get e2e builds more reproducible and ease changes. AMI Management First, we pin the server AMIs to the commits associated with the build.  No more using the latest AMI a developer build in a test branch, or accidentally using a stale AMI because we forgot to build one!  Packer is to tag the AMI images with the commit sha used to generate the image, and then Terraform would look up only the AMIs associated with that sha. To minimize churn, we use the SHA associated with the latest Packer configurations, rather than SHA of all. This has few benefits: reproducibility and avoiding accidental AMI changes and contamination of changes across branches. Also, the change is a stepping stone to an e2e pipeline that builds new AMIs automatically if Packer files changed. The downside is that new AMIs will be generated even for irrelevant changes (e.g. spelling, commits), but I suspect that's OK. Also, an engineer will be forced to build the AMI whenever they change Packer files while iterating on e2e scripts; this hasn't been an issue for me yet, and I'll be open for iterating on that later if it proves to be an issue. Config Files and Packer Second, this PR moves e2e config hcl management to Terraform instead of Packer. Currently, the config files live in ./terraform/config, but they are baked into the servers by Packer and changes are ignored.  This current behavior surprised me, as I spent a bit of time debugging why my config changes weren't applied.  Having Terraform manage them would ease engineer's iteration.  Also, make Packer management more consistent (Packer only works e2e/terraform/packer), and easing the logic for AMI change detection. The config directory is very small (100KB), and having it as an upload step adds negligible time to terraform apply."

4008,consul/connect: Add support for Connect terminating gateways,"This PR implements Nomad built-in support for running Consul Connect terminating gateways. Such a gateway can be used by services running inside the service mesh to access ""legacy"" services running outside the service mesh while still making use of Consul's service identity based networking and ACL policies. https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/gateways/terminating-gateway These gateways are declared as part of a task group level service definition within the connect stanza. service {   connect {     gateway {       proxy {         // envoy proxy configuration       }       terminating {         // terminating-gateway configuration entry       }     }   } } Currently Envoy is the only supported gateway implementation in Consul. The gateay task can be customized by configuring the connect.sidecar_task block. When the gateway.terminating field is set, Nomad will write/update the Configuration Entry into Consul on job submission. Because CEs are global in scope and there may be more than one Nomad cluster communicating with Consul, there is an assumption that any terminating gateway defined in Nomad for a particular service will be the same among Nomad clusters. Gateways require Consul 1.8.0+, checked by a node constraint. Closes #9445"

The check watcher for group services triggers the alloc runner to restart all tasks, but the alloc runner's Restart method doesn't trigger any of the alloc hooks, including the group service hook. The result is that after the first time a check triggers a restart, we'll never restart the tasks of an allocation again. This commit adds a RunnerTaskRestartHook interface so that alloc runner hooks can act if a task within the alloc is restarted. The only implementation is in the group service hook, which will force a re-registration of the alloc's services and fix check restarts."

(i.e. the Write()'d data will be inserted somewhere in the middle of the data being Flush()'d) It's also the case that, because Write() only has a read lock, if you had multiple threads trying to write (""read"") at the same time you might have data loss because the w.buf that was read would not necessarily be up-to-date by the time p2 was appended to it and it was re-assigned to w.buf. You can see this if you run the new gatedwriter tests with -race against the old implementation: WARNING: DATA RACE Read at 0x00c0000c0420 by goroutine 11:   runtime.growslice()       /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/slice.go:125 +0x0   github.com/hashicorp/nomad/helper/gated-writer.(*Writer).Write()       /home/hicks/workspace/nomad/helper/gated-writer/writer.go:41 +0x2b6   github.com/hashicorp/nomad/helper/gated-writer.TestWriter_WithMultipleWriters.func1()       /home/hicks/workspace/nomad/helper/gated-writer/writer_test.go:90 +0xea This race condition is fixed in this change."

4139,tests: deflake test-api job (#9742),"Deflake test-api job, currently failing at around 7.6% (44 out of 578 workflows), by ensuring that test nomad agent use a small dedicated port range that doesn't conflict with the kernel ephemeral range. The failures are disproportionatly related to port allocation, where a nomad agent fails to start when the http port is already bound to another process. The failures are intermitent and aren't specific to any test in particular. The following is a representative failure: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/13995/workflows/6cf6eb38-f93c-46f8-8aa0-f61e62fe7694/jobs/128169 . Upon investigation, the issue seems to be that the api freeport library picks a port block within 10,000-14,500, but that overlaps with the kernel ephemeral range 32,769-60,999! So, freeport may allocate a free port to the nomad agent, just to be used by another process before the nomad agent starts! This happened for example in https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/14111/workflows/e1fcd7ff-f0e0-4796-8719-f57f510b1ffa/jobs/129684 .  freeport allocated port 41662 to serf, but google_accounts raced to use it to connect to the CirleCI vm metadata service. We avoid such races by using a dedicated port range that's disjoint from the kernel ephemeral port range."
4140,tests: deflake TestTaskRunner_StatsHook_Periodic (#9734),"This PR deflakes TestTaskRunner_StatsHook_Periodic tests and adds backoff when the driver closes the channel. TestTaskRunner_StatsHook_Periodic is currently the most flaky test - failing ~4% of the time (20 out of 486 workflows). A sample failure: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/14028/workflows/957b674f-cbcc-4228-96d9-1094fdee5b9c/jobs/128563 . This change has two components: First, it updates the StatsHook so that it backs off when stats channel is closed. In the context of the test where the mock driver emits a single stats update and closes the channel, the test may make tens of thousands update during the period. In real context, if a driver doesn't implement the stats handler properly or when a task finishes, we may generate way too many Stats queries in a tight loop. Here, the backoff reduces these queries. I've added a failing test that shows 154,458 stats updates within 500ms in https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hashicorp/nomad/14092/workflows/50672445-392d-4661-b19e-e3561ed32746/jobs/129423 . Second, the test ignores the first stats update after a task exit. Due to the asynchronicity of updates and channel/context use, it's possible that an update is enqueued while the test marks the task as exited, resulting into a spurious update."

It keeps a fix in the tests around the use of an HTTPS enabled client for when the server is listening on HTTPS.

The state of the client connection and the server socket depends on when the connection is closed and how far along the handshake was."

This PR restores that functionality. There was a missing layer of interpolation that needs to occur for these parameters. Since Nomad 1.0 now supports dynamic envoy versioning through the ${NOMAD_envoy_version} psuedo variable, we basically need to first interpolate ${connect.sidecar_image} => envoyproxy/envoy:v${NOMAD_envoy_version} then use Consul at runtime to resolve to a real image, e.g. envoyproxy/envoy:v${NOMAD_envoy_version} => envoyproxy/envoy:v1.16.0 Of course, if the version of Consul is too old to provide an envoy version preference, we then need to know to fallback to the old version of envoy that we used before. envoyproxy/envoy:v${NOMAD_envoy_version} => envoyproxy/envoy:v1.11.2@sha256:a7769160c9c1a55bb8d07a3b71ce5d64f72b1f665f10d81aa1581bc3cf850d09 Beyond that, we also need to continue to support jobs that set the sidecar task themselves, e.g. sidecar_task { config { image: ""custom/envoy"" } } which itself could include teh pseudo envoy version variable."

4321,client/fingerprint/cpu: use fallback total compute value if cpu not detected,"Previously, Nomad would fail to startup if the CPU fingerprinter could not detect the cpu total compute (i.e. cores * mhz). This is common on some EC2 instance types (graviton class), where the env_aws fingerprinter will override the detected CPU performance with a more accurate value anyway. Instead of crashing on startup, have Nomad use a low default for available cpu performance of 1000 ticks (e.g. 1 core * 1 GHz). This enables Nomad to get past the useless cpu fingerprinting on those EC2 instances. The crashing error message is now a log statement suggesting the setting of cpu_total_compute in client config. Fixes #7989"

As detailed in there, the collection query GET /v1/volumes?type=csi doesn’t return ReadAllocs and WriteAllocs, so the # Allocs cell was always showing 0 upon first load because it was derived from the lengths of those arrays. This uses the heretofore-ignored CurrentReaders and CurrentWriters values to calculate the total instead. The single-resource query GET /v1/volume/csi%2F:id doesn’t return CurrentReaders and CurrentWriters that absence doesn’t override the stored values when visiting an individual item. Thanks to @apollo13 for reporting this and to @tgross for the API logs and suggestion."

The Netlify setup had two “sites”: nomad-storybook and nomad-ui. I attempted to replicate that here but ran into some platform limitations with Vercel: two “projects” cannot share the same root directory without also sharing the same vercel.json that lets us specify configuration such as the rewrite needed to handle deep linking into the Ember UI. I tried having Storybook use /ui/storybook as the root directory (and adding a symbolically-linked package.json to bypass Vercel’s refusal to build without it) but that produced broken Storybook deployments. This instead combines the two projects into one (nomad-storybook-and-ui), defaults to forwarding / to /ui/, and adds the header link to the UI to navigate to Storybook. Rather than have a complex build script in the Vercel configuration UI, this delegates to a script in the repository."

These fields mirror the fields in nomad/structs.CSIVolume. Returning a separate list of stubs for read and write would be ideal, but this can't be done without either bloating the API response with repeated full Allocation data, or causing a panic in previous versions of the CLI. The nomad/structs fields are persisted with nil values and are populated during RPC, so we'll do the same in the HTTP API and populate the ReadAllocs and WriteAllocs fields with a map of allocation IDs, but with null values. The web UI will then create its ReadAllocations and WriteAllocations fields by mapping from those IDs to the values in Allocations, instead of flattening the map into a list."

I encountered an odd behavior related to RPC_REQUEST_RESPONSE_UNIQUE and RPC_REQUEST_STANDARD_NAME.  Apparently, if they target a stream type, we must separate them into separate lines so that the ignore comment targets the type specifically."
4440,csi/ui: show Node Only for volumes when controllers aren't required (#9416),"Plugin health for controllers should show ""Node Only"" in the UI only when both conditions are true: controllers are not required, and no controllers have registered themselves (0 expected controllers). This accounts for ""monolith"" plugins which might register as both controllers and nodes but not necessarily have ControllerRequired = true because they don't implement the Controller RPC endpoints we need (this requirement was added in #7844) This changeset includes the following fixes:  Update the Plugins tab of the UI so that monolith plugins don't show ""Node   Only"" once they've registered. Add the missing ""Node Only"" logic to the Volumes tab of the UI."
4441,client: always wait 200ms before sending updates,"Always wait 200ms before calling the Node.UpdateAlloc RPC to send allocation updates to servers. Prior to this change we only reset the update ticker when an error was encountered. This meant the 200ms ticker was running while the RPC was being performed. If the RPC was slow due to network latency or server load and took >=200ms, the ticker would tick during the RPC. Then on the next loop only the select would randomly choose between the two viable cases: receive an update or fire the RPC again. If the RPC case won it would immediately loop again due to there being no updates to send. When the update chan receive is selected a single update is added to the slice. The odds are then 50/50 that the subsequent loop will send the single update instead of receiving any more updates. This could cause a couple of problems:  Since only a small number of updates are sent, the chan buffer may    fill, applying backpressure, and slowing down other client    operations. The small number of updates sent may already be stale and not    represent the current state of the allocation locally.  A risk here is that it's hard to reason about how this will interact with the 50ms batches on servers when the servers under load. A further improvement would be to completely remove the alloc update chan and instead use a mutex to build a map of alloc updates. I wanted to test the lowest risk possible change on loaded servers first before making more drastic changes."

4443,CSI: fix transaction handling in state store (#9438),"When making updates to CSI plugins, the state store methods that have open write transactions were querying the state store using the same methods used by the CSI RPC endpoint, but these method creates their own top-level read transactions. During concurrent plugin updates (as happens when a plugin job is stopped), this can cause write skew in the plugin counts.  Refactor the CSIPlugin query methods to have an implementation method that accepts a transaction, which can be called with either a read txn or a write txn. Refactor the CSIVolume query methods to have an implementation method that accepts a transaction, which can be called with either a read txn or a write txn. CSI volumes need to be ""denormalized"" with their plugins and (optionally) allocations. Read-only RPC endpoints should take a snapshot so that we can make multiple state store method calls with a consistent view."

Diagnosing this was also compounded by a warning being fired by systemd for the Nomad unit file.  Update the location of the StartLimitIntervalSec field to it's   post-systemd-230 location. Ensure that the weekly AMI build is up-to-date to reduce the risk of   unexpected system software changes. Move the host volume to a directory we can set up at AMI build time rather   than in userdata."

4495,client: fix interpolation in template source,"While Nomad v0.12.8 fixed NOMAD_{ALLOC,TASK,SECRETS}_DIR use in template.destination, interpolating these variables in template.source caused a path escape error. Why not apply the destination fix to source? The destination fix forces destination to always be relative to the task directory. This makes sense for the destination as a destination outside the task directory would be unreachable by the task. There's no reason to ever render a template outside the task directory. (Using .. does allow destinations to escape the task directory if template.disable_file_sandbox = true. That's just awkward and unsafe enough I hope no one uses it.) There is a reason to source a template outside a task directory. At least if there weren't then I can't think of why we implemented template.disable_file_sandbox. So v0.12.8 left the behavior of template.source the more straightforward ""Interpolate and validate."" However, since outside of raw_exec every other driver uses absolute paths for NOMAD_*_DIR interpolation, this means those variables are unusable unless disable_file_sandbox is set. The Fix The variables are now interpolated as relative paths only for the purpose of rendering templates. This is an unfortunate special case, but reflects the fact that the templates view of the filesystem is completely different (unconstrainted) vs the task's view (chrooted). Arguably the values of these variables should be context-specific. I think it's more reasonable to think of the ""hack"" as templating running uncontainerized than that giving templates different paths is a hack. TODO  [ ] E2E tests [ ] Job validation may still be broken and prevent my fix from       working?  raw_exec raw_exec is actually broken a different way as exercised by tests in this commit. I think we should probably remove these tests and fix that in a followup PR/release, but I wanted to leave them in for the initial review and discussion. Since non-containerized source paths are broken anyway, perhaps there's another solution to this entire problem I'm overlooking?"

4571,Don't ignore nil devices in plugin fingerprint,"Even if a plugin sends back an empty []*device.DeviceGroup, it's transformed to nil during the RPC. Our custom device plugin is returning empty FingerprintResponse.Devices very often. Our temporary fix is to send a dummy *DeviceGroup if the slice is empty. This has the effect of never triggering the ""first fingerprint"" and therefore timing out after 50s. In turn, this made our node exceed its hearbeat grace period when restarting it, revoking all vault tokens for its allocations, causing a restart of all our allocations because the token couldn't be renewed.

As Nomad now uses Go modules, it won't necessarily be cloned to $GOPATH. (Additionally, if you had go-gotten Nomad at some point, protoc compilation would have possibly used the wrong protos, as those wouldn't necessarily be the most up-to-date ones.) This change modifies the proto files and the protoc invocation to handle discovering dependent protos via protoc plugin modifier statements that are specific to the protoc plugin being used. In this change, make proto was run to recompile the protos, which results in changes only to the gzipped FileDescriptorProto."

The fingerprinter only checked in /proc/modules which is a list of loaded modules. In some cases, the bridge kernel module is builtin rather than dynamically loaded. The fix for that case is in #8721. However we were still missing the case where the bridge module is dynamically loaded, but not yet loaded during the startup of the Nomad agent. In this case the fingerprinter would believe the bridge module was unavailable when really it gets loaded on demand. This PR now has the fingerprinter scan the kernel module dependency file, which will contain an entry for the bridge module even if it is not yet loaded. In summary, the client now looks for the bridge kernel module in  - /proc/modules  - /lib/modules//modules.builtin  - /lib/modules//modules.dep Closes #8423"

It seems less useful to match within the node, so this changes id search to only match at the beginning of the id."

In the recent security patch we treated the destination absolute path as valid if it didn't escape the working directory, but this breaks backwards compatibility and interpolation of destination fields. This changeset partially reverts the behavior so that we always append the destination, but we also perform the escape check on that new destination after interpolation so the security hole is closed.

4923,consul/connect: dynamically select envoy sidecar at runtime,"As newer versions of Consul are released, the minimum version of Envoy it supports as a sidecar proxy also gets bumped. Starting with the upcoming Consul v1.9.X series, Envoy v1.11.X will no longer be supported. Current versions of Nomad hardcode a version of Envoy v1.11.2 to be used as the default implementation of Connect sidecar proxy. This PR introduces a change such that each Nomad Client will query its local Consul for a list of Envoy proxies that it supports (https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8545) and then launch the Connect sidecar proxy task using the latest supported version of Envoy. If the SupportedProxies API component is not available from Consul, Nomad will fallback to the old version of Envoy supported by old versions of Consul. Setting the meta configuration option meta.connect.sidecar_image or setting the connect.sidecar_task stanza will take precedence as is the current behavior for sidecar proxies. Setting the meta configuration option meta.connect.gateway_image will take precedence as is the current behavior for connect gateways. meta.connect.sidecar_image and meta.connect.gateway_image may make use of the special ${NOMAD_envoy_version} variable interpolation, which resolves to the newest version of Envoy supported by the Consul agent.

This data was incomplete and incorrect depending on region. The AWS API has the correct data but requires API keys to use (i.e. should not be queried directly from Nomad). This change introduces a lookup table generated by a small command line tool in Nomad's tools module which uses the Amazon AWS API. Running the tool requires AWS_* environment variables set.   $ # in nomad/tools/cpuinfo   $ go run . Going forward, Nomad can incorporate regeneration of the lookup table somewhere in the CI pipeline so that we remain up-to-date on the latest offerings from EC2. Fixes #7830"
4942,csi: loosen ValidateVolumeCapability requirements (#9049),"The CSI specification for ValidateVolumeCapability says that we shall ""reconcile successful capability-validation responses by comparing the validated capabilities with those that it had originally requested"" but leaves the details of that reconcilation unspecified. This API is not implemented in Kubernetes, so controller plugins don't have a real-world implementation to verify their behavior against. We have found that CSI plugins in the wild may return ""successful"" but incomplete VolumeCapability responses, so we can't require that all capabilities we expect have been validated, only that the ones that have been validated match. This appears to violate the CSI specification but until that's been resolved in upstream we have to loosen our validation requirements. The tradeoff is that we're more likely to have runtime errors during NodeStageVolume instead of at the time of volume registration."

But block-device mode volumes don't have this option. When RPCs are made to plugins, we are silently dropping the mount options we don't expect to see, but this results in a poor operator experience when the mount options aren't honored. This changeset makes passing mount options to a block-device volume a validation error."
4945,docs: CSI mount_options are available only for filesystem vols (#9043),"The CSI specification allows only the file-system attachment mode to have mount options.

The underlying memberlist library supports the larger key size, and is ultimatley preferable from a security standpoint. Consul also uses 32 bytes by default: https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/commit/1a14b94441dbd715fcb83d78c99fe87de9ad01ea"

This situation arises in the Vagrant setup, where the code repository live on special file sharing volume. Somewhat unrelated, remove f.Sync() invocation from a test copyFile helper function.  Sync is useful only for crash recovery, and isn't necessary in our test setup.  The sync invocation is a significant overhead as it requires the OS to flush any cached writes to disk."

Note that this assumes that the systemd resolver (default to 127.0.0.53) is accessible within the container. This is the case here because exec containers share the same network namespace by default.

The resulting management token is exported as an environment var with $(terraform output environment) and tests that want stricter ACLs will be able to write them using that token.

FWIW, in contexts where we anticipate lots of traffic (e.g. logs, or exec), the api package attempts contacting the client directly but then fallsback to using the server. This approach seems excessive in these simple GET/PUT requests. Fixes #8894"

The logic was that someone might wonder “why isn’t my main task starting?” and this table would show that the prestart tasks hadn’t yet completed. One might wonder the same about any task that has prerequisites, so should a poststart task have a table that shows main tasks? And so on. Since the route hierarchy guarantees that one has already passed through a template that shows the lifecycle chart before one can reach the template where this table is displayed, I believe this table is redundant. It also conveys information in a more abstract way than the chart, which is dense and more easily understood, to me."

Until the deployment is promoted, we ought to replace the canaries with version 0 job (which isn't associated with a deployment)."

Currently Envoy is the only supported gateway implementation in Consul, and Nomad only supports running Envoy as a gateway using the docker driver. Aims to address #8294 and tangentially #8647"

5310,E2E: move Nomad installation to script on remote hosts (#8706),"This changeset moves the installation of Nomad binaries out of the provisioning framework and into scripts that are installed on the remote host during AMI builds. This provides a few advantages:  The provisioning framework can be reduced in scope (with the goal of moving   most of it into the Terraform stack entirely). The scripts can be arbitrarily complex if we don't have to stuff them into   ssh commands, so it's easier to make them idempotent. In this changeset, the   scripts check the version of the existing binary and don't re-download when   using the --nomad_sha or --nomad_version flags. The scripts can be OS/distro specific, which helps in building new test   targets."

This lets us eliminate a bunch of code and associated tests.

This changeset tries all known controllers on ready nodes before giving up, and adds tests that exercise the client RPC routing and retries."

5444,vault: log once per interval if batching revocation,"This log line should be rare since:  Most tokens should be logged synchronously, not via this async    batched method. Async revocation only takes place when Vault    connectivity is lost and after leader election so no revocations are    missed. There should rarely be >1 batch (1,000) tokens to revoke since the    above conditions should be brief and infrequent. Interval is 5 minutes, so this log line will be emitted at most    once every 5 minutes.  What makes this log line rare is also what makes it interesting: due to a bug prior to Nomad 0.11.2 some tokens may never get revoked. Therefore Nomad tries to re-revoke them on every leader election. This caused a massive buildup of old tokens that would never be properly revoked and purged. Nomad 0.11.3 mostly fixed this but still had a bug in purging revoked tokens via Raft (fixed in #8553). The nomad.vault.distributed_tokens_revoked metric is only ticked upon successful revocation and purging, making any bugs or slowness in the process difficult to detect. Logging before a potentially slow revocation+purge operation is performed will give users much better indications of what activity is going on should the process fail to make it to the metric."

The issue has three contributing factors: 1. The plan endpoint doesn't populate the required scaling policy ID; unlike the job register endpoint 2. The plan endpoint suppresses errors on job insertion - the job insertion fails here, because the scaling policy is missing the required ID 3. The scheduler reports no update necessary when the relevant job isn't in store (because the insertion failed) This PR fixes the first two factors.  Changing the scheduler to be more strict might make sense, but may violate some idempotency invariant or make the scheduler more brittle."

This PR establishes a connection proxy between the Consul HTTP listener and a unix socket inside the alloc fs, bypassing the network namespace for any Connect Native task. Similar to and re-uses a bunch of code from the gRPC listener version for envoy sidecar proxies. Proxy is established only if the alloc is configured for bridge networking and there is at least one Connect Native task in the Task Group. Fixes #8290"

5513,vault: expired tokens count toward batch limit,"As of 0.11.3 Vault token revocation and purging was done in batches. However the batch size was only limited by the number of non-expired tokens being revoked. Due to bugs prior to 0.11.3, expired tokens were not properly purged. Long-lived clusters could have thousands to millions of very old expired tokens that never got purged from the state store. Since these expired tokens did not count against the batch limit, very large batches could be created and overwhelm servers. This commit ensures expired tokens count toward the batch limit with this one line change: - if len(revoking) >= toRevoke { + if len(revoking)+len(ttlExpired) >= toRevoke { However, this code was difficult to test due to being in a periodically executing loop. Most of the changes are to make this one line change testable and test it."

In MRD, deployments will make one pass though the loop while ""pending"", and were not ever getting DesiredCanaries set. We can't set it in the initial DeploymentState constructor because the first pass through setting up canaries expects it's not there yet. However, this value is static for a given version of a job because it's coming from the update stanza, so it's safe to re-assign the value on subsequent passes."
5625,refactor: make it clear where we're accessing dstate,"The field name Deployment.TaskGroups contains a map of DeploymentState, which makes it a little harder to follow state updates when combined with inconsistent naming conventions, particularly when we also have the state store or actual TaskGroups in scope.

The ends up triggering an eval from deploymentwatcher when it verifies their health. Although this eval is a no-op, we were only treating pending deployments the same as paused when the deployment was a new MRD. This means that any eval after the initial one will kick off the deployment, and that caused pending deployments to ""jump the queue"" and run ahead of schedule, breaking MRD invariants and resulting in a state with all regions blocked. This behavior can be replicated even in the case of job updates with no in-place updates by patching deploymentwatcher to inject a spurious no-op eval. This changeset fixes the behavior by treating pending deployments the same as paused in all cases in the reconciler."

5680,Atomic eval insertion with job (de-)registration,"This fixes a bug where jobs may get ""stuck"" unprocessed that dispropotionately affect periodic jobs around leadership transitions. When registering a job, the job registration and the eval to process it get applied to raft as two separate transactions; if the job registration succeeds but eval application fails, the job may remain unprocessed. Operators may detect such failure, when submitting a job update and get a 500 error code, and they could retry; periodic jobs failures are more likely to go unnoticed, and no further periodic invocations will be processed until an operator force evaluation. This fixes the issue by ensuring that the job registration and eval application get persisted and processed atomically in the same raft log entry. Also, applies the same change to ensure atomicity in job deregistration. Backward Compatibility We must maintain compatibility in two scenarios: mixed clusters where a leader can handle atomic updates but followers cannot, and a recent cluster processes old log entries from legacy or mixed cluster mode. To handle this constraints: ensure that the leader continue to emit the Evaluation log entry until all servers have upgraded; also, when processing raft logs, the servers honor evaluations found in both spots, the Eval in job (de-)registration and the eval update entries. When an updated server sees mix-mode behavior where an eval is inserted into the raft log twice, it ignores the second instance. I made one compromise in consistency in the mixed-mode scenario: servers may disagree on the eval.CreateIndex value: the leader and updated servers will report the job registration index while old servers will report the index of the eval update log entry. This discripency doesn't seem to be material - it's the eval.JobModifyIndex that matters."

The connect stanza now includes a native parameter, which can be set to the name of task that backs the Connect Native Consul service. There is a new Client configuration parameter for the consul stanza called share_ssl. Like allow_unauthenticated the default value is true, but recommended to be disabled in production environments. When enabled, the Nomad Client's Consul TLS information is shared with Connect Native tasks through the normal Consul environment variables. This does NOT include auth or token information. If Consul ACLs are enabled, Service Identity Tokens are automatically and injected into the Connect Native task through the CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN environment variable. Any of the automatically set environment variables can be overridden by the Connect Native task using the env stanza. Fixes #6083"

5934,Add a key to the alloc table on the task group detail page,"Adding keys tells Ember to rerender matching entries instead of destroying and recreating. Without this key, every time the allocation collection changes, every allocation row gets destroyed and recreated. This happens a lot, since each allocation needs to be reloaded which dirties the collection. Since allocation rows fetch stats on init, each of these many many renders results in a stats request. By using key and rerendering matching records, this all goes away. Since the rows aren't being destroyed and recreated, the init stats request isn't being made overnumerously."

This means we cannot use the tidy target in nomad enterprise, which will be unable to reach private repositories like consul-enterprise.

When it creates the in-place updates to those allocations at the end, it causes the allocation to be treated as running over in the planner, which causes the initial stop_after_client_disconnect evaluation to be retried by the worker."

Using Contexts provide a consistent idiomatic way to manage lifecycle for both internal and external drivers. Also, I discovered few places where we don't clean up a temporary driver instance in the plugin catalog code, where we dispense a driver to inspect and validate the schema config without properly cleaning it up."

It posts or updates a comparison of times and test count. It’s somewhat slow to report back as it runs the test suite three times to even out variability in a shared environment. If we end up being unhappy with that slowness, we could try running the repetitions in parallel as well, but that would involve more changes to ember-test-audit."

6258,volumes: return better error messages for unsupported task drivers (#8030),"When an allocation runs for a task driver that can't support volume mounts, the mounting will fail in a way that can be hard to understand. With host volumes this usually means failing silently, whereas with CSI the operator gets inscrutable internals exposed in the nomad alloc status. This changeset adds a MountConfig field to the task driver Capabilities response. We validate this when the csi_hook or volume_hook fires and return a user-friendly error. Note that we don't currently have a way to get driver capabilities up to the server, except through attributes. Validating this when the user initially submits the jobspec would be even better than what we're doing here (and could be useful for all our other capabilities), but that's out of scope for this changeset. Also note that the MountConfig enum starts with ""supports all"" in order to support community plugins in a backwards compatible way, rather than cutting them off from volume mounting unexpectedly."

This fixes a situation where there is a long backlog of Vault tokens to be revoked on when leadership is gained.  In such case, revoking the tokens will significantly slow down leadership establishment and slow down processing.  Worse, the revocation call does not honor leadership stopCh signals, so it will not stop when the leader loses leadership."

6265,csi: don't pass volume claim releases thru GC eval (#8021),"Following the new volumewatcher in #7794 and performance improvements to it that landed afterwards, there's no particular reason we should be threading claim releases through the GC eval rather than writing an empty CSIVolumeClaimRequest with the mode set to CSIVolumeClaimRelease, just as the GC evaluation would do. Also, by batching up these raft messages, we can reduce the amount of raft writes by 1 and cross-server RPCs by 1 per volume we release claims on."
6266,add notes about delay requirement for reschedule,
6267,"stats_hook: log normal shutdown condition as debug, not error (#8028)","The stats_hook writes an Error log every time an allocation becomes terminal. This is a normal condition, not an error. A real error condition like a failure to collect the stats is logged later. It just creates log noise, and this is a particularly bad operator experience for heavy batch workloads."
6268,docs: notice to operators about script check timeouts (#8015),"The tasklet passes the timeout for the script check into the task driver's Exec, and its up to the task driver to enforce that via a golang context.WithDeadline. In practice, this deadline is started before the task driver starts setting up the execution environment (because we need it to do things like timeout Docker API calls). Under even moderate load, the time it takes to set up the execution context for the script check regularly exceeds a full second or two. This can cause script checks to unexpected timeout or even never execute if the context expires before the task driver ever gets a chance to execve. This changeset adds a notice to operators about setting script check timeouts with plenty of padding and what to monitor for problems."
6269,csi: check for empty arguments on CSI endpoint (#8027),Some of the CSI RPC endpoints were missing validation that the ID or the Volume definition was present. This could result in nonsense CSIVolume structs being written to raft during registration. This changeset corrects that bug and adds validation checks to present nicer error messages to operators in some other cases.

It works by setting a template that requires keys 0,1,2,3,4 and then eventually sets keys 0,1,2,3 and ensures that we get a final event indicating that keys 3 and 4 are still missing. The test waits to get a blocked event for the final state, but it can fail if receives a blocked event for a transitional state (e.g. one reporting 2,3,4,5 are missing). This fixes the test by ensuring that it waits until the final message before assertion. Also, it clarifies the intent of the test with stricter assertions and additional comments."

This is done for two reasons: First, consitency with the CLI: nomad node status --allocs only shows running allocs. Second, and more importantly, the count is useful to estimate how loaded the clients are.  Allocs that have completed (but not GCed yet) have very little value to operators."
6519,csi: fix plugin counts on node update (#7844),"In this changeset:  If a Nomad client node is running both a controller and a node   plugin (which is a common case), then if only the controller or the   node is removed, the plugin was not being updated with the correct   counts. The existing test for plugin cleanup didn't go back to the state   store, which normally is ok but is complicated in this case by   denormalization which changes the behavior. This commit makes the   test more comprehensive. Set ""controller required"" when plugin has PUBLISH_READONLY. All   known controllers that support PUBLISH_READONLY also support   PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME but we shouldn't assume this. Only create plugins when the allocs for those plugins are   healthy. If we allow a plugin to be created for the first time when   the alloc is not healthy, then we'll recreate deleted plugins when   the job's allocs all get marked terminal. Terminal plugin alloc updates should cleanup the plugin. The client   fingerprint can't tell if the plugin is unhealthy intentionally (for   the case of updates or job stop). Allocations that are   server-terminal should delete themselves from the plugin and trigger   a plugin self-GC, the same as an unused node."

6550,csi: check returned volume capability validation (#7831),"This changeset corrects handling of the ValidationVolumeCapabilities response:   The CSI spec for the ValidationVolumeCapabilities requires that   plugins only set the Confirmed field if they've validated all   capabilities. The Nomad client improperly assumes that the lack of a   Confirmed field should be treated as a failure. This breaks the   Azure and Linode block storage plugins, which don't set this   optional field.   The CSI spec also requires that the orchestrator check the validation   responses to guard against older versions of a plugin reporting   ""valid"" for newer fields it doesn't understand. "

6560,csi: move volume claim release into volumewatcher (#7794),"This changeset adds a subsystem to run on the leader, similar to the deployment watcher or node drainer. The Watcher performs a blocking query on updates to the CSIVolumes table and triggers reaping of volume claims. This will avoid tying up scheduling workers by immediately sending volume claim workloads into their own loop, rather than blocking the scheduling workers in the core GC job doing things like talking to CSI controllers The volume watcher is enabled on leader step-up and disabled on leader step-down. The volume claim GC mechanism now makes an empty claim RPC for the volume to trigger an index bump. That in turn unblocks the blocking query in the volume watcher so it can assess which claims can be released for a volume."

6576,env_aws: use best-effort lookup table for CPU performance in EC2,"Fixes #7681 The current behavior of the CPU fingerprinter in AWS is that it reads the current speed from /proc/cpuinfo (CPU MHz field). This is because the max CPU frequency is not available by reading anything on the EC2 instance itself. Normally on Linux one would look at e.g. sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq or perhaps parse the values from the CPU max MHz field in /proc/cpuinfo, but those values are not available. Furthermore, no metadata about the CPU is made available in the EC2 metadata service. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html Since go-psutil cannot determine the max CPU speed it defaults to the current CPU speed, which could be basically any number between 0 and the true max. This is particularly bad on large, powerful reserved instances which often idle at ~800 MHz while Nomad does its fingerprinting (typically IO bound), which Nomad then uses as the max, which results in severe loss of available resources. Since the CPU specification is unavailable programmatically (at least not without sudo) use a best-effort lookup table. This table was generated by going through every instance type in AWS documentation and copy-pasting the numbers. https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ This approach obviously is not ideal as future instance types will need to be added as they are introduced to AWS. However, using the table should only be an improvement over the status quo since right now Nomad miscalculates available CPU resources on all instance types."

I'm not certain how we get into the state, except for being very unlucky.  I suspect that this case may be the result of a concurrent restart or the docker engine API not being fully consistent (e.g. an earlier call purged the container, but docker didn't free up resources yet to create a new container with the same name immediately yet).

6652,core: fix node reservation scoring,"The BinPackIter accounted for node reservations twice when scoring nodes which could bias scores toward nodes with reservations. Pseudo-code for previous algorithm: proposed  = reservedResources + sum(allocsResources)     available = nodeResources - reservedResources     score     = 1 - (proposed / available) The node's reserved resources are added to the total resources used by allocations, and then the node's reserved resources are later substracted from the node's overall resources. The new algorithm is: proposed  = sum(allocResources)     available = nodeResources - reservedResources     score     = 1 - (proposed / available) The node's reserved resources are no longer added to the total resources used by allocations. My guess as to how this bug happened is that the resource utilization variable (util) is calculated and returned by the AllocsFit function which needs to take reserved resources into account as a basic feasibility check. To avoid re-calculating alloc resource usage (because there may be a large number of allocs), we reused util in the ScoreFit function. ScoreFit properly accounts for reserved resources by subtracting them from the node's overall resources. However since util also took reserved resources into account the score would be incorrect. Prior to the fix the added test output: Node: reserved     Score: 1.0000 Node: reserved2    Score: 1.0000 Node: no-reserved  Score: 0.9741 The scores being 1.0 for both nodes with reserved resources is a good hint something is wrong as they should receive different scores. Upon further inspection the double accounting of reserved resources caused their scores to be >1.0 and clamped. After the fix the added test outputs: Node: no-reserved  Score: 0.9741 Node: reserved     Score: 0.9480 Node: reserved2    Score: 0.8717"

6656,structs: fix compatibility between api and nomad/structs proxy definitions,"The field names within the structs representing the Connect proxy definition were not the same (nomad/structs/ vs api/), causing the values to be lost in translation for the 'nomad job inspect' command. Since the field names already shipped in v0.11.0 we cannot simply fix the names. Instead, use the json struct tag on the structs/ structs to remap the name to match the publicly expose api/ package on json encoding. This means existing jobs from v0.11.0 will continue to work, and the JSON API for job submission will remain backwards compatible."

Before this change, if the agent is taking an unexpectedly long time to shutdown, the operator cannot query the http server directly: they cannot access agent specific http endpoints and need to query another agent about the troublesome agent. Unexpectedly long shutdown can happen in normal cases, e.g. a client might hung is if one of the allocs it is running has a long shutdown_delay. Here, we switch to ensuring that the http server is shutdown last. I believe this doesn't require extra care in agent shutting down logic while operators may be able to submit write http requests.  We already need to cope with operators submiting these http requests to another agent or by servers updating the client allocations."

6717,tests: deflake some SetServer related tests,"Some tests assert on numbers on numbers of servers, e.g. TestHTTP_AgentSetServers and TestHTTP_AgentListServers_ACL . Though, in dev and test modes, the agent starts with servers having duplicate entries for advertised and normalized RPC values, then settles with one unique value after Raft/Serf re-sets servers with one single unique value. This leads to flakiness, as the test will fail if assertion runs before Serf update takes effect.

Instead, arrow keys are ignored. It also ignores ^A and ^E, which are cursor manipulations that pose similar problems to arrow keys. It does support ^U, which deletes the entire command. It also allows a command to be pasted, which was previously unsupported. This is accomplished by migrating from Xterm.js’s onKey handler to onData, which is recommended here: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/2673#issuecomment-574897733 onData is a higher-level handler that issues events with the final interpreted data instead of the individual key events. That means the processing in this PR has changed from inspecting DOM key events to inspecting their ASCII equivalents, which I’ve extracted into a utility dictionary for use in tests and implementation. One consequence of ignoring most control characters is that if you paste a string that includes a control character, that character will be stripped. It’s somewhat strange for compound sequences like arrow keys;  if you run copy('/bin/b' + '\x1b[D' + 'ash') in a Javascript console and paste what’s on the clipboard, you get ""/bin/b[Dash"". That’s because the left arrow key, as in that centre portion of the string, is represented by the escape character and a coded sequence. Stripping the control character leaves the coded sequence as part of the paste. That seems like an acceptable compromise vs either ignoring any pasted string with control characters (confusing UX) or trying to interpret and strip all such compound control sequences (difficult to be exhaustive)."

6779,backend: support WS authentication handshake in alloc/exec,"The javascript Websocket API doesn't support setting custom headers (e.g. X-Nomad-Token).  This change adds support for having an authentication handshake message: clients can set ws_handshake URL query parameter to true and send a single handshake message with auth token first before any other mssage. This is a backward compatible change: it does not affect nomad CLI path, as it doesn't set ws_handshake parameter."

This changeset addresses this issue with a redesign of the client-side for CSI. Rather than unmounting in the alloc runner hook, the alloc runner hook will simply exit. When the server gets the Node.UpdateAlloc for the terminal allocation that had a volume claim, it creates a volume claim GC job. This job will made client RPCs to a new node plugin RPC endpoint, and only once that succeeds, move on to making the client RPCs to the controller plugin. If the node plugin is unavailable, the GC job will fail and be requeued."

6850,docs: note why check.Expose is not part of chech.Hash,
6851,connect: enable automatic expose paths for individual group service checks,"Part of #6120 Building on the support for enabling connect proxy paths in #7323, this change adds the ability to configure the 'service.check.expose' flag on group-level service check definitions for services that are connect-enabled. This is a slight deviation from the ""magic"" that Consul provides. With Consul, the 'expose' flag exists on the connect.proxy stanza, which will then auto-generate expose paths for every HTTP and gRPC service check associated with that connect-enabled service. A first attempt at providing similar magic for Nomad's Consul Connect integration followed that pattern exactly, as seen in #7396. However, on reviewing the PR we realized having the expose flag on the proxy stanza inseperably ties together the automatic path generation with every HTTP/gRPC defined on the service. This makes sense in Consul's context, because a service definition is reasonably associated with a single ""task"". With Nomad's group level service definitions however, there is a reasonable expectation that a service definition is more abstractly representative of multiple services within the task group. In this case, one would want to define checks of that service which concretely make HTTP or gRPC requests to different underlying tasks. Such a model is not possible with the course proxy.expose flag. Instead, we now have the flag made available within the check definitions themselves. By making the expose feature resolute to each check, it is possible to have some HTTP/gRPC checks which make use of the envoy exposed paths, as well as some HTTP/gRPC checks which make use of some orthongonal port-mapping to do checks on some other task (or even some other bound port of the same task) within the task group. Given this example, group ""server-group"" {   network {     mode = ""bridge""     port ""forchecks"" {       to = -1     }   } service {     name = ""myserver""     port = 2000 connect {   sidecar_service {   } }  check {   name     = ""mycheck-myserver""   type     = ""http""   port     = ""forchecks""   interval = ""3s""   timeout  = ""2s""   method   = ""GET""   path     = ""/classic/responder/health""   expose   = true }  } } Nomad will automatically inject (via job endpoint mutator) the extrapolated expose path configuration, i.e. expose {   path {     path            = ""/classic/responder/health""     protocol        = ""http""     local_path_port = 2000     listener_port   = ""forchecks""   } } Documentation is coming in #7440 (needs updating, doing next) Modifications to the countdash examples in https://github.com/hashicorp/demo-consul-101/pull/6 which will make the examples in the documentation actually runnable. Will add some e2e tests based on the above when it becomes available."
6852,jobspec: parse multi expose.path instead of explicit slice,
6853,connect: enable proxy.passthrough configuration,"Enable configuration of HTTP and gRPC endpoints which should be exposed by the Connect sidecar proxy. This changeset is the first ""non-magical"" pass that lays the groundwork for enabling Consul service checks for tasks running in a network namespace because they are Connect-enabled. The changes here provide for full configuration of the connect {     sidecar_service {       proxy {         expose {           paths = [{         path =                  protocol =                  local_path_port =                  listener_port =        }, ... ]        }     }   } stanza. Everything from expose and below is new, and partially implements the precedent set by Consul:   https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/registration/service-registration.html#expose-paths-configuration-reference Combined with a task-group level network port-mapping in the form: port ""exposeExample"" { to = -1 } it is now possible to ""punch a hole"" through the network namespace to a specific HTTP or gRPC path, with the anticipated use case of creating Consul checks on Connect enabled services. A future PR may introduce more automagic behavior, where we can do things like 1) auto-fill the 'expose.path.local_path_port' with the default value of the    'service.port' value for task-group level connect-enabled services. 2) automatically generate a port-mapping 3) enable an 'expose.checks' flag which automatically creates exposed endpoints    for every compatible consul service check (http/grpc checks on connect    enabled services)."

This fixes cases where tests panic with a trace like: ``` panic: Log in goroutine after TestAllocGarbageCollector_MakeRoomFor_MaxAllocs has completed goroutine 30 [running]: testing.(common).logDepth(0xc000aa9e60, 0xc000c4a000, 0xab, 0x3)         /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:680 +0x4d3 testing.(common).log(...)         /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:662 testing.(common).Logf(0xc000aa9e60, 0x690b941, 0x4, 0xc001366c00, 0x2, 0x2)         /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14/libexec/src/testing/testing.go:701 +0x7e github.com/hashicorp/nomad/helper/testlog.(writer).Write(0xc000a82a60, 0xc0000b48c0, 0xab, 0x13f, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/helper/testlog/testlog.go:34 +0x106 github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog.(writer).Flush(0xc000a80900, 0xbf9870f000000001, 0x20a87556e, 0x8b12bc0)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog/writer.go:29 +0x14f github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog.(intLogger).log(0xc000e2c180, 0xc0003b6880, 0x17, 0x1, 0x6974edc, 0x22, 0xc000db57a0, 0x6, 0x6)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog/intlogger.go:139 +0x15d github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog.(intLogger).Trace(0xc000e2c180, 0x6974edc, 0x22, 0xc000db57a0, 0x6, 0x6)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog/intlogger.go:446 +0x7a github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog.(interceptLogger).Trace(0xc0002f1ad0, 0x6974edc, 0x22, 0xc000db57a0, 0x6, 0x6)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/go-hclog/interceptlogger.go:48 +0x9c github.com/hashicorp/nomad/nomad/drainer.(*drainingJobWatcher).watch(0xc0002f2380)         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/nomad/drainer/watch_jobs.go:147 +0x1125 created by github.com/hashicorp/nomad/nomad/drainer.NewDrainingJobWatcher         /Users/notnoop/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/nomad/nomad/drainer/watch_jobs.go:89 +0x1e3 FAIL    github.com/hashicorp/nomad/client       10.605s FAIL ```"

Two factors some at play: First, in [1], we accidentally switched the ultimate AWS test from checking ami-id to instance-id.  This means that nomad started treating more environments as AWS; e.g. Hetzner implements instance-id but not ami-id. Second, some of these environments return empty values instead of errors!  Hetzner returns empty 200 response for local-ipv4, resulting into bad networking configuration. This change fix the situation by restoring the check to ami-id and ensuring that we only set network configuration when the ip address is not-empty.  Also, be more defensive around response whitespace input. [1] https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/6779"

It also updates existing volume related views on job and allocation pages to handle both Host Volumes and CSI Volumes.

7094,csi: add mount_options to volumes and volume requests (#7398),"Add mount_options to both the volume definition on registration and to the volume block in the group where the volume is requested. If both are specified, the options provided in the request replace the options defined in the volume. They get passed to the NodePublishVolume, which causes the node plugin to actually mount the volume on the host. Individual tasks just mount bind into the host mounted volume (unchanged behavior).

We deploy a job that writes to the volume, stop that job, and reuse the volume for another job which should be able to read the data written by the first job. The EFS test launches the EFS plugin (nodes-only) and registers an EFS volume as a Nomad CSI volume.

7119,csi: VolumeCapabilities for ControllerPublishVolume,This commit introduces support for providing VolumeCapabilities during requests to ControllerPublishVolumes as this is a required field.
7120,csi: Fix Controller RPCs,"Currently the handling of CSINode RPCs does not correctly handle forwarding RPCs to Nodes. This commit fixes this by introducing a shim RPC (nomad/client_csi_enpdoint) that will correctly forward the request to the owning node, or submit the RPC to the client. In the process it also cleans up handling a little bit by adding the CSIControllerQuery embeded struct for required forwarding state. The CSIControllerQuery embeding the requirement of a PluginID also means we could move node targetting into the shim RPC if wanted in the future."
7121,client: Rename ClientCSI -> CSIController,
7122,csi: Add /dev mounts to CSI Plugins,"CSI Plugins that manage devices need not just access to the CSI directory, but also to manage devices inside /dev. This commit introduces a /dev:/dev mount to the container so that they may do so."
7123,csi: volume claim garbage collection (#7125),"When an alloc is marked terminal (and after node unstage/unpublish have been called), the client syncs the terminal alloc state with the server via Node.UpdateAlloc RPC. For each job that has a terminal alloc, the Node.UpdateAlloc RPC handler at the server will emit an eval for a new core job to garbage collect CSI volume claims. When this eval is handled on the core scheduler, it will call a volumeReap method to release the claims for all terminal allocs on the job. The volume reap will issue a ControllerUnpublishVolume RPC for any node that has no alloc claiming the volume. Once this returns (or is skipped), the volume reap will send a new CSIVolume.Claim RPC that releases the volume claim for that allocation in the state store, making it available for scheduling again. This same volumeReap method will be called from the core job GC, which gives us a second chance to reclaim volumes during GC if there were controller RPC failures."

7128,"csi_endpoint: Provide AllocID in req, and return Volume","Currently, the client has to ship an entire allocation to the server as part of performing a VolumeClaim, this has a few problems: Firstly, it means the client is sending significantly more data than is required (an allocation contains the entire contents of a Nomad job, alongside other irrelevant state) which has a non-zero (de)serialization cost. Secondly, because the allocation was never re-fetched from the state store, it means that we were potentially open to issues caused by stale state on a misbehaving or malicious client. The change removes both of those issues at the cost of a couple of more state store lookups, but they should be relatively cheap. We also now provide the CSIVolume in the response for a claim, so the client can perform a Claim without first going ahead and fetching all of the volumes."

This allows us to validate the capabilities before users attempt to use the volumes during most cases, and also prevents registering volumes without first setting up a plugin, which should help to catch typos and the like during registration. This does have the downside of requiring users to wait for (1) instance of a plugin to be running in their cluster before they can register volumes."

We pass the attachment/access mode seperately from the volume as it simplifies some handling and doesn't necessarily force every attachment to use the same mode should more be supported (I.e if we let each volume ""foo"" {} specify an override in the future)."

It takes a relatively simplistic approach to performing NodeUnpublishVolume calls, optimising for cleaning up any leftover state rather than terminating early in the case of errors.

It should eventually probably be replaced with something a little bit more message based, but for things that only come from pre-run hooks, and don't change, it's probably fine for now."
7143,csi_hook: Stage/Mount volumes as required,"This commit introduces the first stage of volume mounting for an allocation. The csimanager.VolumeMounter interface manages the blocking and actual minutia of the CSI implementation allowing this hook to do the minimal work of volume retrieval and creating mount info. In the future the CSIVolume.Get request should be replaced by CSIVolume.Claim(Batch?) to minimize the number of RPCs and to handle external triggering of a ControllerPublishVolume request as required. We also need to ensure that if pre-run hooks fail, we still get a full unwinding of any publish and staged volumes to ensure that there are no hanging references to volumes. That is not handled in this commit."
7144,client: Pass an RPC Client to AllocRunners,"As part of introducing support for CSI, AllocRunner hooks need to be able to communicate with Nomad Servers for validation of and interaction with storage volumes.

7145,csi: server-to-controller publish/unpublish RPCs (#7124),"Nomad servers need to make requests to CSI controller plugins running on a client for publish/unpublish.

Right now this is an empty method body without even a config file stanza. Later changesets will implement the logic of volume publication GC.
7169,volume_manager: NodeStageVolume Support,This commit introduces support for staging volumes when a plugin implements the STAGE_UNSTAGE_VOLUME capability. See the following for further reference material:  https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/4731db0e0bc53238b93850f43ab05d9355df0fd9/spec.md#nodestagevolume
7170,csi: Expose grpc.CallOptions for NodeStageVolume,
7171,volume_manager: Introduce helpers for staging,This commit adds helpers that create and validate the staging directory for a given volume. It is currently missing usage options as the interfaces are not yet in place for those. The staging directory is only required when a volume has the STAGE_UNSTAGE Volume capability and has to live within the plugin root as the plugin needs to be able to create mounts inside it from within the container.
7172,helper/mount: Add mount helper package,"This package introduces some basic abstractions around mount utilties for various platforms. Initially it only supports linux, but the plan is to expand this as CSI expands across to other platforms."

7175,csi: Add VolumeManager (#6920),"This changeset is some pre-requisite boilerplate that is required for introducing CSI volume management for client nodes. It extracts out fingerprinting logic from the csi instance manager. This change is to facilitate reusing the csimanager to also manage the node-local CSI functionality, as it is the easiest place for us to guaruntee health checking and to provide additional visibility into the running operations through the fingerprinter mechanism and goroutine. It also introduces the VolumeMounter interface that will be used to manage staging/publishing unstaging/unpublishing of volumes on the host."

These fields have a few special characteristics that I've tried to model here - specificially, we make a basic attempt to avoid printing data that should be redacted during debug logs (additional mount flags), and also attempt to make debuggability of other integer fields easier by implementing the fmt.Stringer and fmt.GoStringer interfaces as necessary. We do not currnetly implement a CSI Protobuf -> Nomad implementation transformation as this is currently not needed by any used RPCs."

7216,CSI Plugin Registration (#6555),"This changeset implements the initial registration and fingerprinting of CSI Plugins as part of #5378. At a high level, it introduces the following:   A csi_plugin stanza as part of a Nomad task configuration, to   allow a task to expose that it is a plugin.   A new task runner hook: csi_plugin_supervisor. This hook does two   things. When the csi_plugin stanza is detected, it will   automatically configure the plugin task to receive bidirectional   mounts to the CSI intermediary directory. At runtime, it will then   perform an initial heartbeat of the plugin and handle submitting it to   the new dynamicplugins.Registry for further use by the client, and   then run a lightweight heartbeat loop that will emit task events   when health changes.   The dynamicplugins.Registry for handling plugins that run   as Nomad tasks, in contrast to the existing catalog that requires   go-plugin type plugins and to know the plugin configuration in   advance.   The csimanager which fingerprints CSI plugins, in a similar way to   drivermanager and devicemanager. It currently only fingerprints   the NodeID from the plugin, and assumes that all plugins are   monolithic.   Missing features   We do not use the live updates of the dynamicplugin registry in   the csimanager yet.   We do not deregister the plugins from the client when they shutdown   yet, they just become indefinitely marked as unhealthy. This is   deliberate until we figure out how we should manage deploying new   versions of plugins/transitioning them. "

7233,health tracker: account for group service checks,
7234,health check account for task lifecycle,"In service jobs, lifecycles non-sidecar task tweak health logic a bit: they may terminate successfully without impacting alloc health, but fail the alloc if they fail. Sidecars should be treated just like a normal task."
7235,health: fail health if any task is pending,"Fixes a bug where an allocation is considered healthy if some of the tasks are being restarted and as such, their checks aren't tracked by consul agent client. Here, we fix the immediate case by ensuring that an alloc is healthy only if tasks are running and the registered checks at the time are healthy. Previously, health tracker tracked task ""health"" independently from checks and leads to problems when a task restarts.  Consider the following series of events:  all tasks start running -> tracker.tasksHealthy is true one task has unhealthy checks and get restarted remaining checks are healthy -> tracker.checksHealthy is true propagate health status now that tracker.tasksHealthy and tracker.checksHealthy.  This change ensures that we accurately use the latest status of tasks and checks regardless of their status changes. Also, ensures that we only consider check health after tasks are considered healthy, otherwise we risk trusting incomplete checks. This approach accomodates task dependencies well.  Service jobs can have prestart short-lived tasks that will terminate before main process runs. These dead tasks that complete successfully will not negate health status."

We must wait until the server side recognizes the connection closing and free up a limits slot.

As such, I change the logic so it retries on connection rejection but force the first non-EOF failure to be a deadline error."

7309,server: node connections must not be forwarded,"This fixes a bug where a forwarded node update request may be assumed to be the actual direct client connection if the server just lost leadership. When a nomad non-leader server receives a Node.UpdateStatus request, it forwards the RPC request to the leader, and holds on the request Yamux connection in a cache to allow for server<->client forwarding. When the leader handles the request, it must differentiate between a forwarded connection vs the actual connection.  This is done in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v0.10.4/nomad/node_endpoint.go#L412 Now, consider if the non-leader server forwards to the connection to a recently deposed nomad leader, which in turn forwards the RPC request to the new leader. Without this change, the deposed leader will mistake the forwarded connection for the actual client connection and cache it mapped to the client ID.  If the server attempts to connect to that client, it will attempt to start a connection/session to the other server instead and the call will hang forever. This change ensures that we only add node connection mapping if the request is not a forwarded request, regardless of circumstances."

7391,Simplify Bootstrap logic in tests,"This change updates tests to honor BootstrapExpect exclusively when forming test clusters and removes test only knobs, e.g. config.DevDisableBootstrap. Background: Test cluster creation is fragile.  Test servers don't follow the BootstapExpected route like production clusters.  Instead they start as single node clusters and then get rejoin and may risk causing brain split or other test flakiness. The test framework expose few knobs to control those (e.g. config.DevDisableBootstrap and config.Bootstrap) that control whether a server should bootstrap the cluster.  These flags are confusing and it's unclear when to use: their usage in multi-node cluster isn't properly documented.  Furthermore, they have some bad side-effects as they don't control Raft library: If config.DevDisableBootstrap is true, the test server may not immediately attempt to bootstrap a cluster, but after an election timeout (~50ms), Raft may force a leadership election and win it (with only one vote) and cause a split brain. The knobs are also confusing as Bootstrap is an overloaded term.  In BootstrapExpect, we refer to bootstrapping the cluster only after N servers are connected.  But in tests and the knobs above, it refers to whether the server is a single node cluster and shouldn't wait for any other server. Changes: This commit makes two changes: First, it relies on BootstrapExpected instead of Bootstrap and/or DevMode flags.  This change is relatively trivial. Introduce a Bootstrapped flag to track if the cluster is bootstrapped. This allows us to keep BootstrapExpected immutable.  Previously, the flag was a config value but it gets set to 0 after cluster bootstrap completes."

7522,client: enable configuring enable_tag_override for services,"Consul provides a feature of Service Definitions where the tags associated with a service can be modified through the Catalog API, overriding the value(s) configured in the agent's service configuration. To enable this feature, the flag enable_tag_override must be configured in the service definition. Previously, Nomad did not allow configuring this flag, and thus the default value of false was used. Now, it is configurable. Because Nomad itself acts as a state machine around the the service definitions of the tasks it manages, it's worth describing what happens when this feature is enabled and why. Consider the basic case where there is no Nomad, and your service is provided to consul as a boring JSON file. The ultimate source of truth for the definition of that service is the file, and is stored in the agent. Later, Consul performs ""anti-entropy"" which synchronizes the Catalog (stored only the leaders). Then with enable_tag_override=true, the tags field is available for ""external"" modification through the Catalog API (rather than directly configuring the service definition file, or using the Agent API). The important observation is that if the service definition ever changes (i.e. the file is changed & config reloaded OR the Agent API is used to modify the service), those ""external"" tag values are thrown away, and the new service definition is once again the source of truth. In the Nomad case, Nomad itself is the source of truth over the Agent in the same way the JSON file was the source of truth in the example above. That means any time Nomad sets a new service definition, any externally configured tags are going to be replaced. When does this happen? Only on major lifecycle events, for example when a task is modified because of an updated job spec from the 'nomad job run ' command. Otherwise, Nomad's periodic re-sync's with Consul will now no longer try to restore the externally modified tag values (as long as enable_tag_override=true). Fixes #2057"

Though, some more rigorous testing is required before merging this. I want to call out some implementation details: First, the current connection pool reuses the Yamux stream for multiple RPC calls, and doesn't close them until an error is encountered.  This commit doesn't change it, and sets the RpcNomad byte only at stream creation. Second, the StreamingRPC session gets closed by callers and cannot be reused. Every StreamingRPC opens a new Yamux session."

7664,core: add limits to unauthorized connections,"Introduce limits to prevent unauthorized users from exhausting all ephemeral ports on agents:  {https,rpc}_handshake_timeout {http,rpc}_max_conns_per_client  The handshake timeout closes connections that have not completed the TLS handshake by the deadline (5s by default). For RPC connections this timeout also separately applies to first byte being read so RPC connections with TLS enabled have rpc_handshake_time * 2 as their deadline. The connection limit per client prevents a single remote TCP peer from exhausting all ephemeral ports. The default is 100, but can be lowered to a minimum of 26. Since streaming RPC connections create a new TCP connection (until MultiplexV2 is used), 20 connections are reserved for Raft and non-streaming RPCs to prevent connection exhaustion due to streaming RPCs. All limits are configurable and may be disabled by setting them to 0. This also includes a fix that closes connections that attempt to create TLS RPC connections recursively. While only users with valid mTLS certificates could perform such an operation, it was added as a safeguard to prevent programming errors before they could cause resource exhaustion."

7758,e2e: document e2e provisioning process (#6976),
7759,Handle Nomad leadership flapping,"Fixes a deadlock in leadership handling if leadership flapped. Raft propagates leadership transition to Nomad through a NotifyCh channel. Raft blocks when writing to this channel, so channel must be buffered or aggressively consumed[1]. Otherwise, Raft blocks indefinitely in raft.runLeader until the channel is consumed[1] and does not move on to executing follower related logic (in raft.runFollower). While Raft runLeader defer function blocks, raft cannot process any other raft operations.  For example, run{Leader|Follower} methods consume raft.applyCh, and while runLeader defer is blocked, all raft log applications or config lookup will block indefinitely. Sadly, leaderLoop and establishLeader makes few Raft calls! establishLeader attempts to auto-create autopilot/scheduler config [3]; and leaderLoop attempts to check raft configuration [4].  All of these calls occur without a timeout. Thus, if leadership flapped quickly while leaderLoop/establishLeadership is invoked and hit any of these Raft calls, Raft handler deadlock forever. Depending on how many times it flapped and where exactly we get stuck, I suspect it's possible to get in the following case:  Agent metrics/stats http and RPC calls hang as they check raft.Configurations raft.State remains in Leader state, and server attempts to handle RPC calls   (e.g. node/alloc updates) and these hang as well  As we create goroutines per RPC call, the number of goroutines grow over time and may trigger a out of memory errors in addition to missed updates.

This changeset also makes the test safe to run multiple times by namespacing the file with the alloc ID, which has the added bonus of exercising our alloc interpolation code for group script checks."
7765,e2e: update framework to allow deploying Nomad (#6969),"The e2e framework instantiates clients for Nomad/Consul but the provisioning of the actual Nomad cluster is left to Terraform. The Terraform provisioning process uses remote-exec to deploy specific versions of Nomad so that we don't have to bake an AMI every time we want to test a new version. But Terraform treats the resulting instances as immutable, so we can't use the same tooling to update the version of Nomad in-place. This is a prerequisite for upgrade testing. This changeset extends the e2e framework to provide the option of deploying Nomad (and, in the future, Consul/Vault) with specific versions to running infrastructure. This initial implementation is focused on deploying to a single cluster via ssh (because that's our current need), but provides interfaces to hook the test run at the start of the run, the start of each suite, or the start of a given test case. Terraform work includes: * provides Terraform output that written to JSON used by the framework   to configure provisioning via terraform output provisioning. * provides Terraform output that can be used by test operators to   configure their shell via $(terraform output environment) * drops remote-exec provisioning steps from Terraform * makes changes to the deployment scripts to ensure they can be run   multiple times w/ different versions against the same host."
7766,UI: Migrate to Storybook (#6507),"I originally planned to add component documentation, but as this dragged on and I found that JSDoc-to-Markdown sometimes needed hand-tuning, I decided to skip it and focus on replicating what was already present in Freestyle. Adding documentation is a finite task that can be revisited in the future. My goal was to migrate everything from Freestyle with as few changes as possible. Some adaptations that I found necessary: • the DelayedArray and DelayedTruth utilities that delay component rendering until slightly after initial render because without them:   ◦ charts were rendering with zero width   ◦ the JSON viewer was rendering with empty content • Storybook in Ember renders components in a routerless/controllerless context by default, so some component stories needed changes:   ◦ table pagination/sorting stories access to query params, which necessitates some reaching into Ember internals to start routing and dynamically generate a Storybook route/controller to render components into   ◦ some stories have a faux controller as part of their Storybook context that hosts setInterval-linked dynamic computed properties • some jiggery-pokery with anchor tags   ◦ inert href='#' had to become href='javascript:;   ◦ links that are actually meant to navigate need target='_parent' so they don’t navigate inside the Storybook iframe Maybe some of these could be addressed by fixes in ember-cli-storybook but I’m wary of digging around in there any more than I already have, as I’ve lost a lot of time to Storybook confusion and frustrations already 😞 The STORYBOOK=true environment variable tweaks some environment settings to get things working as expected in the Storybook context. I chose to: • use angle bracket invocation within stories rather than have to migrate them soon after having moved to Storybook • keep Freestyle around for now for its palette and typeface components"

Make the service file update do a systemd daemon-reload so that we   can update an already-running cluster with the same script we use to   deploy it initially.

The reason is that we have flag parsing library effectively writes to ui.Error in a goroutine.  This is problematic: first, we lose the sequencing between help usage and error message; second, cli.Ui methods are not concurrent safe. Here, we introduce a custom error writer that buffers result and calls ui.Error() in the write method and in the same goroutine. For context, we need to wrap ui.Error because it's line-oriented, while flags library expects a io.Writer which is bytes oriented."

This is problematic for Nomad, because interacting with the EC2 API is in our client start path. Here we revert to our pre-existing behaviour of not performing retries in the fast path, as if the metadata service is unavailable, it's likely that nomad is not running in AWS."

7892,UI: Fix client sorting (#6817),"There are two changes here, and some caveats/commentary:   The “State“ table column was actually sorting only by status. The state was not an actual property, just something calculated in each client row, as a product of status, isEligible, and isDraining. This PR adds isDraining as a component of compositeState so it can be used for sorting.   The Sortable mixin declares dependent keys that cause the sort to be live-updating, but only if the members of the array change, such as if a new client is added, but not if any of the sortable properties change. This PR adds a SortableFactory function that generates a mixin whose listSorted computed property includes dependent keys for the sortable properties, so the table will live-update if any of the sortable properties change, not just the array members. There’s a warning if you use SortableFactory without dependent keys and via the original Sortable interface, so we can eventually migrate away from it. "

7897,Merge pull request #6838 from hashicorp/f-parallelize-state-store-tests,tests: parallelize state store tests
7898,executor: stop joining executor to container cgroup,"Stop joining libcontainer executor process into the newly created task container cgroup, to ensure that the cgroups are fully destroyed on shutdown, and to make it consistent with other plugin processes. Previously, executor process is added to the container cgroup so the executor process resources get aggregated along with user processes in our metric aggregation. However, adding executor process to container cgroup adds some complications with much benefits: First, it complicates cleanup.  We must ensure that the executor is removed from container cgroup on shutdown.  Though, we had a bug where we missed removing it from the systemd cgroup.  Because executor uses containerState.CgroupPaths on launch, which includes systemd, but cgroups.GetAllSubsystems which doesn't. Second, it may have advese side-effects.  When a user process is cpu bound or uses too much memory, executor should remain functioning without risk of being killed (by OOM killer) or throttled. Third, it is inconsistent with other drivers and plugins.  Logmon and DockerLogger processes aren't in the task cgroups.  Neither are containerd processes, though it is equivalent to executor in responsibility. Fourth, in my experience when executor process moves cgroup while it's running, the cgroup aggregation is odd.  The cgroup memory.usage_in_bytes doesn't seem to capture the full memory usage of the executor process and becomes a red-harring when investigating memory issues. For all the reasons above, I opted to have executor remain in nomad agent cgroup and we can revisit this when we have a better story for plugin process cgroup management."

7913,tests: swap lib/freeport for tweaked helper/freeport,"Copy the updated version of freeport (sdk/freeport), and tweak it for use in Nomad tests. This means staying below port 10000 to avoid conflicts with the lib/freeport that is still transitively used by the old version of consul that we vendor. Also provide implementations to find ephemeral ports of macOS and Windows environments. Ports acquired through freeport are supposed to be returned to freeport, which this change now also introduces. Many tests are modified to include calls to a cleanup function for Server objects. This should help quite a bit with some flakey tests, but not all of them. Our port problems will not go away completely until we upgrade our vendor version of consul. With Go modules, we'll probably do a 'replace' to swap out other copies of freeport with the one now in 'nomad/helper/freeport'."

7918,driver: allow disabling log collection,"Operators commonly have docker logs aggregated using various tools and don't need nomad to manage their docker logs.  Worse, Nomad uses a somewhat heavy docker api call to collect them and it seems to cause problems when a client runs hundreds of log collections. Here we add a knob to disable log aggregation completely for nomad. When log collection is disabled, we avoid running logmon and docker_logger for the docker tasks in this implementation. The downside here is once disabled, nomad logs ... commands and API no longer return logs and operators must corrolate alloc-ids with their aggregated log info. This is meant as a stop gap measure.  Ideally, we'd follow up with at least two changes: First, we should optimize behavior when we can such that operators don't need to disable docker log collection.  Potentially by reverting to using pre-0.9 syslog aggregation in linux environments, though with different trade-offs. Second, when/if logs are disabled, nomad logs endpoints should lookup docker logs api on demand.  This ensures that the cost of log collection is paid sparingly."

7960,scheduler: fix job update placement on prev node penalized (#6781),"Fixes #5856 When the scheduler looks for a placement for an allocation that's replacing another allocation, it's supposed to penalize the previous node if the allocation had been rescheduled or failed. But we're currently always penalizing the node, which leads to unnecessary migrations on job update. This commit leaves in place the existing behavior where if the previous alloc was itself rescheduled, its previous nodes are also penalized. This is conservative but the right behavior especially on larger clusters where a group of hosts might be having correlated trouble (like an AZ failure).

Since RemoveAllocs nils elements of the proposed alloc slice and is called twice, it could panic on the second call when erroneously accessing a nil'd alloc. The fix is to not copy the proposed alloc slice and pass the slice returned by the 1st RemoveAllocs call to the 2nd call, thus maintaining the trimmed length."

8040,tests: remove TestClient_RestoreError test,"TestClient_RestoreError is very slow, taking ~81 seconds. It has few problematic patterns.  It's unclear what it tests, it simulates a failure condition where all state db lookup fails and asserts that alloc fails.  Though starting from https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/6216 , we don't fail allocs in that condition but rather restart them. Also, the drivers used in second client c2 are the same singleton instances used in c1 and already shutdown.  We ought to start healthy new driver instances."

In a scheduler versions more often represent the earliest release all required features/APIs are available in a system. Whether the constraint or the version being evaluated are prereleases has no impact on ordering. This commit adds a new constraint - semver - which will use Semver v2.0 ordering when evaluating constraints. Given the above examples:  1.3.0-beta1 satisfies "">= 0.6.1"" using semver 1.7.0-rc1 satisfies "">= 1.6.0-beta1"" using semver  Since existing jobspecs may rely on the old behavior, a new constraint was added and the implicit Consul Connect and Vault constraints were updated to use it."

We're also running all the provisioning scripts inside the userdata by polling for the zip file to show up (gross!). This is because remote-exec provisioners are failing on Windows with the same symptoms as: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17728 If we can't fix this, it'll prevent us from having multiple Windows clients running until TF supports count interpolation in the template_file, which is planned for a later 0.12 release."

8151,Allow UI to query client directly,"Nomad web UI currently fails when querying client nodes for allocation state end endpoints, due to CORS policy. The issue is that CORS requests that are marked withCredentials need the http server to include a Access-Control-Allow-Credentials [1]. But Nomad Task Logs and filesystem requests include authenticating information and thus marked with credentials=true[2][3]. It's worth noting that the browser currently sends credentials and authentication token to servers anyway; it's just that the response is not made available to caller nomad ui javascript.  For task logs specifically, nomad ui retries again by querying the web ui address (typically pointing to a nomad server) which will forward the request to the nomad client agent appropriately.

8244,client: fix panic from 0.8 -> 0.10 upgrade,makeAllocTaskServices did not do a nil check on AllocatedResources which causes a panic when upgrading directly from 0.8 to 0.10. While skipping 0.9 is not supported we intend to fix serious crashers caused by such upgrades to prevent cluster outages. I did a quick audit of the client package and everywhere else that accesses AllocatedResources appears to be properly guarded by a nil check.

Merging all runtime provisioning scripts into a single script for each of server/client solves the following:  Userdata scripts can't take arguments, they can only be templated   and that means we have to do TF escaping in bash/powershell scripts. TF provisioning scripts race with userdata scripts."

If needed, that can be passed using the named blocks syntax.  https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#block Unfortunately, using a contextual component doesn’t help as the yield inside that component will still result in content rendering that would show when the source isn’t empty.

8342,docker: periodically reconcile containers,"When running at scale, it's possible that Docker Engine starts containers successfully but gets wedged in a way where API call fails. The Docker Engine may remain unavailable for arbitrary long time. Here, we introduce a periodic reconcilation process that ensures that any container started by nomad is tracked, and killed if is running unexpectedly. Basically, the periodic job inspects any container that isn't tracked in its handlers.  A creation grace period is used to prevent killing newly created containers that aren't registered yet. Also, we aim to avoid killing unrelated containters started by host or through raw_exec drivers.  The logic is to pattern against containers environment variables and mounts to infer if they are an alloc docker container. Lastly, the periodic job can be disabled to avoid any interference if need be."

8365,volumes: Add support for mount propagation,"This commit introduces support for configuring mount propagation when mounting volumes with the volume_mount stanza on Linux targets. Similar to Kubernetes, we expose 3 options for configuring mount propagation:   private, which is equivalent to rprivate on Linux, which does not allow the            container to see any new nested mounts after the chroot was created.   host-to-task, which is equivalent to rslave on Linux, which allows new mounts                 that have been created outside of the container to be visible                 inside the container after the chroot is created.   bidirectional, which is equivalent to rshared on Linux, which allows both                  the container to see new mounts created on the host, but                  importantly allows the container to create mounts that are                  visible in other containers an don the host   private and host-to-task are safe, but bidirectional mounts can be dangerous, as if the code inside a container creates a mount, and does not clean it up before tearing down the container, it can cause bad things to happen inside the kernel. To add a layer of safety here, we require that the user has ReadWrite permissions on the volume before allowing bidirectional mounts, as a defense in depth / validation case, although creating mounts should also require a priviliged execution environment inside the container."

The allocation endpoints perform ACL checks against the request namespace, not the allocation namespace, and performs the allocation lookup independently from namespaces. Here, we check that the requested can access the alloc namespace regardless of the declared request namespace. Ideally, we'd enforce that the declared request namespace matches the actual allocation namespace.  Unfortunately, we haven't documented alloc endpoints as namespaced functions; we suspect starting to enforce this will be very disruptive and inappropriate for a nomad point release.  As such, we maintain current behavior that doesn't require passing the proper namespace in request.  A future major release may start enforcing checking declared namespace."

Allocation and FS endpoint are handled by the client; one can query the relevant client directly, or query a server to have it forwarded transparently to relevant client.  Querying the client directly is benefecial to avoid loading servers with IO. As an optimization, the CLI attempts to query the client directly, but then falls back to using server forwarding path if it encounters network or connection errors (e.g. clients are locked down or in a separate inaccessible network). Here, we fix a bug where if the CLI fails to find to lookup the client details because it lacks ACL capability or other unexpected reasons, the CLI will not go through fallback path."

There’s no direct Ember Data-style relationship between a TaskState and its Task; instead, it’s determined by searching for a Task with the matching name. The related Task was sometimes stored before everything was ready and not recalculated when the name became known. This ensures the relationship is accurate if the TaskState’s name property changes."
8503,command: Improve metrics fail logging,
8504,client_stats: Always emit client stats,
8505,client: Return empty values when host stats fail,"Currently, there is an issue when running on Windows whereby under some circumstances the Windows stats API's will begin to return errors (such as internal timeouts) when a client is under high load, and potentially other forms of resource contention / system states (and other unknown cases). When an error occurs during this collection, we then short circuit further metrics emission from the client until the next interval. This can be problematic if it happens for a sustained number of intervals, as our metrics aggregator will begin to age out older metrics, and we will eventually stop emitting various types of metrics including nomad.client.unallocated.* metrics. However, when metrics collection fails on Linux, gopsutil will in many cases (e.g cpu.Times) silently return 0 values, rather than an error. Here, we switch to returning empty metrics in these failures, and logging the error at the source. This brings the behaviour into line with Linux/Unix platforms, and although making aggregation a little sadder on intermittent failures, will result in more desireable overall behaviour of keeping metrics available for further investigation if things look unusual."

8538,docs: Remove config from volumes,
8539,config: Hoist volume.config.source into volume,"Currently, using a Volume in a job uses the following configuration: ``` volume ""alias-name"" {   type = ""volume-type""   read_only = true config {     source = ""host_volume_name""   } } ``` This commit migrates to the following: volume ""alias-name"" {   type = ""volume-type""   source = ""host_volume_name""   read_only = true } The original design was based due to being uncertain about the future of storage plugins, and to allow maxium flexibility. However, this causes a few issues, namely: - We frequently need to parse this configuration during submission, scheduling, and mounting - It complicates the configuration from and end users perspective - It complicates the ability to do validation As we understand the problem space of CSI a little more, it has become clear that we won't need the source to be in config, as it will be used in the majority of cases:  Host Volumes: Always need a source Preallocated CSI Volumes: Always needs a source from a volume or claim name Dynamic Persistent CSI Volumes*: Always needs a source to attach the volumes                                    to for managing upgrades and to avoid dangling. Dynamic Ephemeral CSI Volumes: Less thought out, but source will probably point                                   to the plugin name, and a config block will                                   allow you to pass meta to the plugin. Or will                                   point to a pre-configured ephemeral config. If implemented  The new design simplifies this by merging the source into the volume stanza to solve the above issues with usability, performance, and error handling."

8586,dev: avoid codecgen code in downstream projects,"This is an attempt to ease dependency management for external driver plugins, by avoiding requiring them to compile ugorji/go generated files.  Plugin developers reported some pain with the brittleness of ugorji/go dependency in particular, specially when using go mod, the default go mod manager in golang 1.13. Context Nomad uses msgpack to persist and serialize internal structs, using ugorji/go library.  As an optimization, we use ugorji/go code generation to speedup process and aovid the relection-based slow path. We commit these generated files in repository when we cut and tag the release to ease reproducability and debugging old releases.  Thus, downstream projects that depend on release tag, indirectly depends on ugorji/go generated code. Sadly, the generated code is brittle and specific to the version of ugorji/go being used.  When go mod picks another version of ugorji/go then nomad (go mod by default uses release according to semver), downstream projects face compilation errors. Interestingly, downstream projects don't commonly serialize nomad internal structs.  Drivers and device plugins use grpc instead of msgpack for the most part.  In the few cases where they use msgpag (e.g. decoding task config), they do without codegen path as they run on driver specific structs not the nomad internal structs.  Also, the ugorji/go serialization through reflection is generally backward compatible (mod some ugorji/go regression bugs that get introduced every now and then :( ). Proposal The proposal here is to keep committing ugorji/go codec generated files for releases but to use a go tag for them. All nomad development through the makefile, including releasing, CI and dev flow, has the tag enabled. Downstream plugin projects, by default, will skip these files and life proceed as normal for them. The downside is that nomad developers who use generated code but avoid using make must start passing additional go tag argument.  Though this is not a blessed configuration."

8657,support script checks for task group services (#6197),"In Nomad prior to Consul Connect, all Consul checks work the same except for Script checks. Because the Task being checked is running in its own container namespaces, the check is executed by Nomad in the Task's context. If the Script check passes, Nomad uses the TTL check feature of Consul to update the check status. This means in order to run a Script check, we need to know what Task to execute it in. To support Consul Connect, we need Group Services, and these need to be registered in Consul along with their checks. We could push the Service down into the Task, but this doesn't work if someone wants to associate a service with a task's ports, but do script checks in another task in the allocation. Because Nomad is handling the Script check and not Consul anyways, this moves the script check handling into the task runner so that the task runner can own the script check's configuration and lifecycle. This will allow us to pass the group service check configuration down into a task without associating the service itself with the task. When tasks are checked for script checks, we walk back through their task group to see if there are script checks associated with the task. If so, we'll spin off script check tasklets for them. The group-level service and any restart behaviors it needs are entirely encapsulated within the group service hook."

Without this, such users will have their tasks run unexpectedly on upgrade and only see the bug resolved after subsequent restart. If, on restore, the client sees a pending alloc without any other persisted info, then err on the side that it's an corrupt persisted state of an alloc instead of the client happening to be killed right when alloc is assigned to client. Few reasons motivate this behavior: Statistically speaking, corruption being the cause is more likely.  A long running client will have higher chance of having allocs persisted incorrectly with pending state.  Being killed right when an alloc is about to start is relatively unlikely. Also, delaying starting an alloc that hasn't started (by hopefully seconds) is not as severe as launching too many allocs that may bring client down. More importantly, this helps customers upgrade their clients without risking taking their clients down and destablizing their cluster. We don't want existing users to force triggering the bug while they upgrade and restart cluster."

8745,Don't persist allocs of destroyed alloc runners,"This fixes a bug where allocs that have been GCed get re-run again after client is restarted.  A heavily-used client may launch thousands of allocs on startup and get killed. The bug is that an alloc runner that gets destroyed due to GC remains in client alloc runner set.  Periodically, they get persisted until alloc is gced by server.  During that  time, the client db will contain the alloc but not its individual tasks status nor completed state.  On client restart, client assumes that alloc is pending state and re-runs it. Here, we fix it by ensuring that destroyed alloc runners don't persist any alloc to the state DB. This is a short-term fix, as we should consider revamping client state management.  Storing alloc and task information in non-transaction non-atomic concurrently while alloc runner is running and potentially changing state is a recipe for bugs.

8928,api: add follow param to file stream endpoint (#6049),"The /v1/client/fs/stream endpoint supports tailing a file by writing chunks out as they come in. But not all browsers support streams (ex IE11) so we need to be able to tail a file without streaming. The fs stream and logs endpoint use the same implementation for filesystem streaming under the hood, but the fs stream always passes the follow parameter set to true. This adds the same toggle to the fs stream endpoint that we have for logs. It defaults to true for backwards compatibility."

9099,consul: fix deadlock in check-based restarts,"Fixes #5395 Alternative to #5957 Make task restarting asynchronous when handling check-based restarts. This matches the pre-0.9 behavior where TaskRunner.Restart was an asynchronous signal. The check-based restarting code was not designed to handle blocking in TaskRunner.Restart. 0.9 made it reentrant and could easily overwhelm the buffered update chan and deadlock. Many thanks to @byronwolfman for his excellent debugging, PR, and reproducer! I created this alternative as changing the functionality of TaskRunner.Restart has a much larger impact. This approach reverts to old known-good behavior and minimizes the number of places changes are made."

9129,rpc: use tls wrapped connection for streaming rpc,"This ensures that server-to-server streaming RPC calls use the tls wrapped connections. Prior to this, streamingRpcImpl function uses tls for setting header and invoking the rpc method, but returns unwrapped tls connection. Thus, streaming writes fail with tls errors. This tls streaming bug existed since 0.8.0[1], but PR #5654[2] exacerbated it in 0.9.2.  Prior to PR #5654, nomad client used to shuffle servers at every heartbeat -- servers.Manager.setServers[3] always shuffled servers and was called by heartbeat code[4].  Shuffling servers meant that a nomad client would heartbeat and establish a connection against all nomad servers eventually.  When handling streaming RPC calls, nomad servers used these local connection to communicate directly to the client.  The server-to-server forwarding logic was left mostly unexercised. PR #5654 means that a nomad client may connect to a single server only and caused the server-to-server forward streaming RPC code to get exercised more and unearthed the problem.

9210,Fail alloc if alloc runner prestart hooks fail,"When an alloc runner prestart hook fails, the task runners aren't invoked and they remain in a pending state. This leads to terrible results, some of which are: * Lockup in GC process as reported in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/5861 * Lockup in shutdown process as TR.Shutdown() waits for WaitCh to be closed * Alloc not being restarted/rescheduled to another node (as it's still in   pending state) * Unexpected restart of alloc on a client restart, potentially days/weeks after   alloc expected start time! Here, we treat all tasks to have failed if alloc runner prestart hook fails. This fixes the lockups, and permits the alloc to be rescheduled on another node. While it's desirable to retry alloc runner in such failures, I opted to treat it out of scope.  I'm afraid of some subtles about alloc and task runners and their idempotency that's better handled in a follow up PR.

9211,Block rpc handling until state store is caught up,"Here, we ensure that when leader only responds to RPC calls when state store is up to date.  At leadership transition or launch with restored state, the server local store might not be caught up with latest raft logs and may return a stale read. The solution here is to have an RPC consistency read gate, enabled when establishLeadership completes before we respond to RPC calls. establishLeadership is gated by a raft.Barrier which ensures that all prior raft logs have been applied. Conversely, the gate is disabled when leadership is lost. This is very much inspired by https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/3154/files"

9224,client: defensive against getting stale alloc updates,"When fetching node alloc assignments, be defensive against a stale read before killing local nodes allocs. The bug is when both client and servers are restarting and the client requests the node allocation for the node, it might get stale data as server hasn't finished applying all the restored raft transaction to store. Consequently, client would kill and destroy the alloc locally, just to fetch it again moments later when server store is up to date. The bug can be reproduced quite reliably with single node setup (configured with persistence).  I suspect it's too edge-casey to occur in production cluster with multiple servers, but we may need to examine leader failover scenarios more closely. In this commit, we only remove and destroy allocs if the removal index is more recent than the alloc index. This seems like a cheap resiliency fix we already use for detecting alloc updates. A more proper fix would be to ensure that a nomad server only serves RPC calls when state store is fully restored or up to date in leadership transition cases."

We can't transparently handle this in the CreateAndRead handle, because the Access Is Denied error is too generic to reliably be an IO error. Instead, we add an explict API for opening a reader to an existing FIFO, and check to see if the fifo already exists inside the calling package (e.g logmon)"

SnapshotMinIndex was chosen as it describes the action (snapshot), a constraint (minimum), and the object of the constraint (index)."
9246,nomad: evaluate plans after previous plan index,"The previous commit prevented evaluating plans against a state snapshot which is older than the snapshot at which the plan was created.  This is correct and prevents failures trying to retrieve referenced objects that may not exist until the plan's snapshot. However, this is insufficient to guarantee consistency if the following events occur:  P1, P2, and P3 are enqueued with snapshot @ 100 Leader evaluates and applies Plan P1 with snapshot @ 100 Leader evaluates Plan P2 with snapshot+P1 @ 100 P1 commits @ 101 Leader evaluates applies Plan P3 with snapshot+P2 @ 100  Since only the previous plan is optimistically applied to the state store, the snapshot used to evaluate a plan may not contain the N-2 plan! To ensure plans are evaluated and applied serially we must consider all previous plan's committed indexes when evaluating further plans. Therefore combined with the last PR, the minimum index at which to evaluate a plan is: min(previousPlanResultIndex, plan.SnapshotIndex)"
9247,nomad: include snapshot index when submitting plans,"Plan application should use a state snapshot at or after the Raft index at which the plan was created otherwise it risks being rejected based on stale data. This commit adds a Plan.SnapshotIndex which is set by workers when submitting plan. SnapshotIndex is set to the Raft index of the snapshot the worker used to generate the plan. Plan.SnapshotIndex plays a similar role to PlanResult.RefreshIndex. While RefreshIndex informs workers their StateStore is behind the leader's, SnapshotIndex is a way to prevent the leader from using a StateStore behind the worker's. Plan.SnapshotIndex should be considered the lower bound index for consistently handling plan application. Plans must also be committed serially, so Plan N+1 should use a state snapshot containing Plan N. This is guaranteed for plans after the first plan after a leader election. The Raft barrier on leader election ensures the leader's statestore has caught up to the log index at which it was elected. This guarantees its StateStore is at an index > lastPlanIndex."

With this addon, the expected and result remain the same, but “failed” is replaced with the text of the assertion. The typical way to address this is to supply the optional final argument to the assertion function that customises the failure message.

9315,Avoid de-registering slowly restored services,"When a nomad client restarts/upgraded, nomad restores state from running task and starts the sync loop.  If sync loop runs early, it may deregister services from Consul prematurely even when Consul has the running service as healthy. This is not ideal, as re-registering the service means potentially waiting a whole service health check interval before declaring the service healthy. We attempt to mitigate this by introducing an initialization probation period.  During this time, we only deregister services and checks that were explicitly deregistered, and leave unrecognized ones alone.  This serves as a grace period for restoring to complete, or for operators to restore should they recognize they restored with the wrong nomad data directory."

9322,Use init to handle plugin invocation,"Currently, nomad ""plugin"" processes (e.g. executor, logmon, docker_logger) are started as CLI commands to be handled by command CLI framework.  Plugin launchers use discover.NomadBinary() to identify the binary and start it. This has few downsides: The trivial one is that when running tests, one must re-compile the nomad binary as the tests need to invoke the nomad executable to start plugin.  This is frequently overlooked, resulting in puzzlement. The more significant issue with executor in particular is in relation to external driver:   Plugin must identify the path of invoking nomad binary, which is not trivial; discvoer.NomadBinary() now returns the path to the plugin rather than to nomad, preventing external drivers from launching executors.   The external driver may get a different version of executor than it expects (specially if we make a binary incompatible change in future).   This commit addresses both downside by having the plugin invocation handling through an init() call, similar to how libcontainer init handler is done in [1] and recommened by libcontainer [2].  init() will be invoked and handled properly in tests and external drivers. For external drivers, this change will cause external drivers to launch the executor that's compiled against. There a are a couple of downsides to this approach: * These specific packages (i.e executor, logmon, and dockerlog) need to be careful in use of init(), package initializers.  Must avoid having command execution rely on any other init in the package.  I prefixed files with z_ (golang processes files in lexical order), but ensured we don't depend on order. * The command handling is spread in multiple packages making it a bit less obvious how plugin starts are handled.

We introduced a regression when migrating to stable service identifiers where multiple services with the same name would conflict, and the last definition would take precedence. This commit includes the port label in the stable service identifier to allow the previous behaviour where this was supported, for example providing: ```hcl service {   name = ""redis-cache""   tags = [""global"", ""cache""]   port = ""db""   check {     name     = ""alive""     type     = ""tcp""     interval = ""10s""     timeout  = ""2s""   } } service {   name = ""redis-cache""   tags = [""global"", ""foo""]   port = ""foo"" check {     name     = ""alive""     type     = ""tcp""     port     = ""db""     interval = ""10s""     timeout  = ""2s""   } } service {   name = ""redis-cache""   tags = [""global"", ""bar""]   port = ""bar"" check {     name     = ""alive""     type     = ""tcp""     port     = ""db""     interval = ""10s""     timeout  = ""2s""   } } ``` in a nomad task definition is now completely valid. Each service definition with the same name must still have a unique port label however."

This is trivially reproducible with the dev agent and a job that has 2 tasks, 1 of which fails. The correct logic would be to SnapshotAfter the previous plan's index to ensure consistency. New clusters or newly elected leaders will not have a previous plan, so the index the leader was elected should be used instead."

The new approach does a once.Do call in runAllocs to accomplish the same thing with less work. Able to remove the gate abstraction that did much more than was needed.

9612,client: do not restart dead tasks until server is contacted,"Fixes #1795 Running restored allocations and pulling what allocations to run from the server happen concurrently. This means that if a client is rebooted, and has its allocations rescheduled, it may restart the dead allocations before it contacts the server and determines they should be dead. This commit makes tasks that fail to reattach on restore wait until the server is contacted before restarting."

9621,evalbroker: Simplify nextDelayedEval locking,
9622,evalbroker: No new enqueues when disabled,"Currently when an evalbroker is disabled, it still recieves delayed enqueues via log application in the fsm. This causes an ever growing heap of evaluations that will never be drained, and can cause memory issues in larger clusters, or when left running for an extended period of time without a leader election. This commit prevents the enqueuing of evaluations while we are disabled, and relies on the leader restoreEvals routine to handle reconciling state during a leadership transition. Existing dequeues during an Enabled->Disabled broker state transition are handled by the enqueueLocked function dropping evals."
9623,evalbroker: Flush within update lock,"Primarily a cleanup commit, however, currently there is a potential race condition (that I'm not sure we've ever actually hit) during a flapping SetEnabled/Disabled state where we may never correctly restart the eval broker, if it was being called from multiple routines."

The caller can then use libcontainer.utils.RecvFd() to get tty master end. I chose github.com/kr/pty for managing TTYs here.

Furthermore, the API endpoint operates against the raw core nomad exec streaming datastructures, defined in protobuf, with json serializer.

We check alloc.TaskResources for networking for other tasks in the task group [1], so it's a bit odd that we used the task.Resources struct here.  TaskRunner also uses alloc.TaskResources[2].

9761,consul: Do not deregister external checks,"This commit causes sync to skip deregistering checks that are not managed by nomad, such as service maintenance mode checks.  This is handled in the same way as service registrations - by doing a Nomad specific prefix match."
9762,consul: Use a stable identifier for services,"The current implementation of Service Registration uses a hash of the nomad-internal state of a service to register it with Consul, this means that any update to the service invalidates this name and we then deregister, and recreate the service in Consul. While this behaviour slightly simplifies reasoning about service registration, this becomes problematic when we add consul health checks to a service. When the service is re-registered, so are the checks, which default to failing for at least one check period. This commit migrates us to using a stable identifier based on the allocation, task, and service identifiers, and uses the difference between the remote and local state to decide when to push updates. It uses the existing hashing mechanic to decide when UpdateTask should regenerate service registrations for providing to Sync, but this should be removable as part of a future refactor. It additionally introduces the _nomad-check- prefix for check definitions, to allow for future allowing of consul features like maintenance mode."

9783,add nomad streaming exec core data structures and interfaces,"In this commit, we add two driver interfaces for supporting nomad exec invocation:  A high level ExecTaskStreamingDriver, that operates on io reader/writers.   Drivers should prefer using this interface A low level ExecTaskStreamingRawDriver that operates on the raw stream of   input structs; useful when a driver delegates handling to driver backend (e.g.   across RPC/grpc).  The interfaces are optional for a driver, as nomad exec support is opt-in. Existing drivers continue to compile without exec support, until their maintainer add such support. Furthermore, we create protobuf structures to represent exec stream entities: ExecTaskStreamingRequest and ExecTaskStreamingResponse.  We aim to reuse the protobuf generated code as much as possible, without translation to avoid conversion overhead. ExecTaskStream abstract fetching and sending stream entities.  It's influenced by the grpc bi-directional stream interface, to avoid needing any adapter.  I considered using channels, but the asynchronisity and concurrency makes buffer reuse too complicated, which would put more pressure on GC and slows exec operation."

Thereforce, I opted to use Docker parser only for Windows, and keep Nomad's linux parser to preserve current behavior."

The crash seems to occur at the first log message after the nomad agent dies. To ease debugging we forward executor log messages to executor.log as well as to Stderr.  go-plugin sets up plugins with Stderr pointing to a pipe being read by plugin client, the nomad agent in our case[1]. When the nomad agent dies, the pipe is closed, and any subsequent executor logs fail with ErrClosedPipe and SIGPIPE signal.  SIGPIPE results into executor process dying. I considered adding a handler to ignore SIGPIPE, but hc-log library currently panics when logging write operation fails[2] This we opt to revert to v0.8 behavior of exclusively writing logs to executor.log, while we investigate alternative options.

9909,client: wait for batched driver updated,"Here we retain 0.8.7 behavior of waiting for driver fingerprints before registering a node, with some timeout.  This is needed for system jobs, as system job scheduling for node occur at node registration, and the race might mean that a system job may not get placed on the node because of missing drivers. The timeout isn't strictly necessary, but raising it to 1 minute as it's closer to indefinitely blocked than 1 second.  We need to keep the value high enough to capture as much drivers/devices, but low enough that doesn't risk blocking too long due to misbehaving plugin.

9914,Merge pull request #5573 from hashicorp/dani/update-vol-docs,docs: Clarify docker volume behaviour
9915,Switch to pre-0.9 behaviour for handling volumes,"In Nomad 0.9, we made volume driver handling the same for """", and ""local"" volumes. Prior to Nomad 0.9 however these had slightly different behaviour for relative paths and named volumes. Prior to 0.9 the empty string would expand relative paths within the task dir, and ""local"" volumes that are not absolute paths would be treated as docker named volumes. This commit reverts to the previous behaviour as follows: | Nomad Version | Driver  |   Volume Spec    | Behaviour                 | |------------------------------------------------------------------------- | all           | """"      | testing:/testing | allocdir/testing          | | 0.8.7         | ""local"" | testing:/testing | ""testing"" as named volume | | 0.9.0         | ""local"" | testing:/testing | allocdir/testing          | | 0.9.1         | ""local"" | testing:/testing | ""testing"" as named volume |"
9916,loggging: Attempt to recover logmon failures,"Currently, when logmon fails to reattach, we will retry reattachment to the same pid until the task restart specification is exhausted. Because we cannot clear hook state during error conditions, it is not possible for us to signal to a future restart that it shouldn't attempt to reattach to the plugin. Here we revert to explicitly detecting reattachment seperately from a launch of a new logmon, so we can recover from scenarios where a logmon plugin has failed. This is a net improvement over the current hard failure situation, as it means in the most common case (the pid has gone away), we can recover. Other reattachment failure modes where the plugin may still be running could potentially cause a duplicate process, or a subsequent failure to launch a new plugin. If there was a duplicate process, it could potentially cause duplicate logging. This is better than a production workload outage. If there was a subsequent failure to launch a new plugin, it would fail in the same (retry until restarts are exhausted) as the current failure mode."

Looks like we have a case where docker logger is started even through logmon isn't. In such case, the fifo writer blocks indefinitely and because the open operation happens in the main goroutine, nomad agent blocks indefinitely. This fixes the issue where the fifo open operation happens in goroutine instead of main goroutine. We should follow up independently to ensure logmon <-> dockerlogger ordering and consider having task recovery happen in non-main goroutine with some sensible timeouts."

10123,Merge pull request #5511 from hashicorp/b-executor-path-executable,"This is a follow up work to https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/4813 to fix #4809 and fix a regression introduced in 0.9 in marking files in libcontainer executable. 4809 bug is that lookupBin uses exec.LookPath when not inspecting task dir files.  exec.LookPath only returns a file if it's already marked as an executable path in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.12.1/src/os/exec/lp_unix.go#L24-L27 .  This affects raw exec as if passed an absolute path to file, lookupBin returns an error if file isn't already an executable.  This explains why the error manifests when an absolute interpolated path is used (e.g. ${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}/hellov1) but not when using a task rel dir (e.g. local/hellov1) in the above examples used in ticket. PR #4813 remedied this problem for raw exec but inadvertably broke libcontainer executor, as it made lookupBin returns the paths to host files rather than ones found inside chroot. This PR reorders the evaluation, so we go back to 0.8 behavior of looking up task directories first, but then check for host paths before using exec.LookPath. This PR is broken into three commits to illustrate evolution and confirming hypothesis: 1. 9adab75ac84b5c2a7b84702fae02c2484abb50ad : Adding a test illustrating how libcontainer executor fails at marking processes as executable in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514942694 - note that the test doesn't depend on artifacts or interpolated paths 2. d441cdd52f68912e96dc7ee5baf2dcddb0ac8caa: reverting PR #4809 and showing the test fail now with raw_exec case (as expected) in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514944065 2. 244544b735a8dbac0e14e7ee85e12a39780cbbb9: in where we add the check in appropriate place next to exec.LookPath(...) for absolute paths and have a green job in https://travis-ci.org/hashicorp/nomad/jobs/514945024 Future work Inspecting lookupBin in 0.8 and 0.9 case, we have a bug in using exec.LookPath for the libcontainer executor case.  We should be looking up paths based on the container chroot and container PATH rather than the host's.  However, this is not a 0.9.0 regression and was present in 0.8; so punting to fix it post 0.9."

I implemented (2) first as it's simpler, but @notnoop pointed out since the same destCh in reused in the stats loop there's now a double close panic possible! So this implements (1) by adding a *usageSender struct for handling concurrent senders and closing."

10153,fifo: Use plain fifo file in Unix,"This PR switches to using plain fifo files instead of golang structs managed by containerd/fifo library. The library main benefit is management of opening fifo files.  In Linux, a reader open() request would block until a writer opens the file (and vice-versa).  The library uses goroutines so that it's the first IO operation that blocks. This benefit isn't really useful for us: Given that logmon simply streams output in a separate process, blocking of opening or first read is effectively the same. The library additionally makes further complications for managing state and tracking read/write permission that seems overhead for our use, compared to using a file directly. Looking here, I made the following incidental changes: * document that we do handle if fifo files are already created, as we rely on that behavior for logmon restarts * use type system to lock read vs write: currently, fifo library returns io.ReadWriteCloser even if fifo is opened for writing only!"

The deployment guide also had some strange things like running Nomad as a non-root user. It would be fine for servers but completely breaks clients. For simplicity I simply removed the non-root user references.

10242,Handle when cannot fetch docker logs (#5420),"Fix #5418 When using a docker logger that doesn't support log streaming through API, currently docker logger runs a tight loop of Docker API calls unexpectedly.

10243,Regenerate Proto files (#5421),"Noticed that the protobuf files are out of sync with ones generated by 1.2.0 protoc go plugin. The cause for these files seem to be related to release processes, e.g. 0.9.0-beta1 preperation, and 0.9.0-beta3 preperation. This restores the changes to that of the pinned protoc version and fails build if protobuf files are out of sync.

10283,nomad: compare current eval when setting WaitIndex,"Consider currently dequeued Evaluation's ModifyIndex when determining its WaitIndex. Normally the Evaluation itself would already be in the state store snapshot used to determine the WaitIndex. However, since the FSM applies Raft messages to the state store concurrently with Dequeueing, it's possible the currently dequeued Evaluation won't yet exist in the state store snapshot used by JobsForEval. This can be solved by always considering the current eval's modify index and using it if it is greater than all of the evals returned by the state store."
10284,client: ensure task is cleaned up when terminal,"This commit is a significant change. TR.Run is now always executed, even for terminal allocations. This was changed to allow TR.Run to cleanup (run stop hooks) if a handle was recovered. This is intended to handle the case of Nomad receiving a DesiredStatus=Stop allocation update, persisting it, but crashing before stopping AR/TR. The commit also renames task runner hook data as it was very easy to accidently set state on Requests instead of Responses using the old field names."

10290,drivers/docker: rename logging type to driver,"Docker uses the term logging driver in its public documentations: in docker daemon config[1], docker run arguments [2] and in docker compose file[3]. Interestingly, docker used type in its API [4] instead of everywhere else. It's unfortunate that Nomad used type modeling after the Docker API rather than the user facing documents.  Nomad using type feels very non-user friendly as it's disconnected from how Docker markets the flag and shows internal representation instead. Here, we rectify the situation by introducing driver field and prefering it over type in logging.

10307,client: restart task on logmon failures,This code chooses to be conservative as opposed to optimal: when failing to reattach to logmon simply return a recoverable error instead of immediately trying to restart logmon. The recoverable error will cause the task's restart policy to be applied and a new logmon will be launched upon restart. Trying to do the optimal approach of simply starting a new logmon requires error string comparison and should be tested against a task actively logging to assert the behavior (are writes blocked? dropped?).

The hook data wasn't being saved because it was put on the request    struct, not the response struct. The plugin configuration should only have reattach or a command    set. Not both. Setting Done=true meant the hook was never re-run on agent restart so    reattaching was never attempted."
10332,fingerprint: improve initial fingerpint message,"The initial fingerprint message is actually fairly useful, so I bumped it to Debug and fixed the output formatting."
10333,plugins: squelch context Canceled error logs,"As far as I can tell this is the most straightforward and resilient way to skip error logging on context cancellation with grpc streams. You cannot compare the error against context.Canceled directly as it is of type *status.statusError. The next best solution I found was: go resp, err := stream.Recv() if code, ok := err.(interface{ Code() code.Code }); ok {     if code.Code == code.Canceled {         return     } } However I think checking ctx.Err() directly makes the code much easier to read and is resilient against grpc API changes."

10371,drivers: restore port_map old json support,"This ensures that port_map along with other block like attribute declarations (e.g. ulimit, labels, etc) can handle various hcl and json syntax that was supported in 0.8. In 0.8.7, the following declarations are effectively equivalent: ``` // hcl block port_map {   http = 80   https = 443 } // hcl assignment port_map = {   http  = 80   https = 443 } // json single element array of map (default in API response) {""port_map"": [{""http"": 80, ""https"": 443}]} // json array of individual maps (supported accidentally iiuc) {""port_map: [{""http"": 80}, {""https"": 443}]} ``` We achieve compatbility by using NewAttr(""..."", ""list(map(string))"", false) to be serialized to a map[string]string wrapper, instead of using BlockAttrs declaration.  The wrapper merges the list of maps automatically, to ease driver development. This approach is closer to how v0.8.7 implemented the fields [1][2], and despite its verbosity, seems to perserve 0.8.7 behavior in hcl2. This is only required for built-in types that have backward compatibility constraints.  External drivers should use BlockAttrs instead, as they see fit.

10391,drivers/java: restore 0.8.7 java version detection (#5317),"Restore 0.8.x behavior where java driver is marked as detected when java -version exits with 0 but returns unexpected output. Furthermore, we restore behavior when java -version where we parse the first three lines of java -version but ignore rest. If java -version returns less than 3 lines, Nomad 0.8.7 would panic. In this implementation, we'd still mark java as detected but returns empty version. The 0.8.7 logic for detecting java version is found in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v0.8.7/client/driver/java.go#L132-L172 . I punt on revamping how we can be more resilient to java -version syntax, and aimed for preserving existing behavior instead."

10608,CHANGELOG: added 0.9 ui changes,
10609,test: port TestTaskRunner_CheckWatcher_Restart,"Added ability to adjust the number of events the TaskRunner keeps as there's no way to observe all events otherwise. Task events differ slightly from 0.8 because 0.9 emits Terminated every time a task exits instead of only when it exits on its own (not due to restart or kill). 0.9 does not emit Killing/Killed for restarts like 0.8 which seems fine as Restart Signaled/Terminated/Restarting is more descriptive. Original v0.8 events emitted: expected := []string{         ""Received"",         ""Task Setup"",         ""Started"",         ""Restart Signaled"",         ""Killing"",         ""Killed"",         ""Restarting"",         ""Started"",         ""Restart Signaled"",         ""Killing"",         ""Killed"",         ""Restarting"",         ""Started"",         ""Restart Signaled"",         ""Killing"",         ""Killed"",         ""Not Restarting"",     }"

It joins 2 servers, but then goes out of its way to make sure the test client only interacts with one. There are not enough comments for me to figure out the precise assertions this test is trying to make. A good old fashioned wait-for-the-client-to-register seems to fix the flakiness though. The error was that the node could not be found, so this makes some sense. However, lots of other tests seem to use the same ""wait for node"" logic and don't appear to be flaky, so who knows why waiting fixes this one. Passes with -race."

Here, we add a code generator that imports the relevant constants from nomad/structs. I considered using this approach for other structs, but didn't find a quick viable way to reduce duplication.  nomad/structs use values as struct fields (e.g. string), while api uses value pointer (e.g. *string) instead.  Also, sometimes, api structs contain deprecated fields or additional documentation, so simple copy-paste doesn't work. For these reasons, I opt to keep the status quo."

Pre-0.9, we made all host devices available to exec tasks accidentally, yet most applications only use a small subset, and this choice limits our ability to restrict/isolate GPU and other devices. Starting with 0.9, by default, we only provide the same subset of devices Docker provides, and allow users to provide more devices as needed on case-by-case basis. This reverts commit 5805c64a9f1c3b409693493dfa30e7136b9f547b. This reverts commit ff9a4a17e59388dcab067949e0664f645b2f5bcf."

The root cause is that we have an old root attribute for all drivers like: attr.driver.docker = ""1"" When attributes were opaque variable names it was fine to also have ""nested"" attributes like: attr.driver.docker.version = ""1.2.3"" However in the HCLv2 world the variable names are no longer opaque: they form an object tree. The docker object can no longer both hold a value (""1"") and nested attributes (version = ""1.2.3""). The Fix: Since the old attr.driver.<name> = ""1"" attribues are useless for task config interpolation, create a new precedence rule for creating the task config evaluation context: Maps take precedence over primitives. This means attr.driver.docker.version will always take precedence over attr.driver.docker. The results are determinstic and give users access to the more useful metadata. I made this a general precedence rule instead of special-casing driver attrs because it seemed like better default behavior than spamming WARNings to logs that were likely unactionable by users."

Since driver fingerprinting has been implemented by the driver manager, it is no longer needed in the fingerprint mananger and has been removed."

11084,allocwatcher: Add Group AllocWatcher,"The Group Alloc watcher is an implementation of a PrevAllocWatcher that can wait for multiple previous allocs before terminating. This is to be used when running an allocation that is preempting upstream allocations, and thus only supports being ran with a local alloc watcher. It also currently requires all of its child watchers to correctly handle context cancellation. Should this be a problem, it should be fairly easy to implement a replacement using channels rather than a waitgroup. It obeys the PrevAllocWatcher interface for convenience, but it may be better to extract Migration capabilities into a seperate interface for greater clarity."

Out of disk space) even when the problem is fixed (eg. disk space is available again). That automatically means that FileRotator will stop writing any logs, reporting the same error over and over again, even if it's no longer valid. This PR fixes it by resetting the bufio Writer, which resets any errors and tries to write requested data."

11128,Don't GC running but desired stop allocations,This PR fixes an edge case where we could GC an allocation that was in a desired stop state but had not terminated yet. This can be hit if the client hasn't shutdown the allocation yet or if the allocation is still shutting down (long kill_timeout). Fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4940

11147,consul: add ScriptExecutor context wrapper,"Since d335a82859ca2177bc6deda0c2c85b559daf2db3 ScriptExecutors now take a timeout duration instead of a context. This broke the script check removal code which used context cancelation propagation to remove script checks while they were executing. This commit adds a wrapper around ScriptExecutors that obeys context cancelation again. The only downside is that it leaks a goroutine until the underlying Exec call completes or timeouts. Since check removal is relatively rare, check timeouts usually low, and scripts usually fast, the risk of leaking a goroutine seems very small."
11148,Fix docker tests,"Some tests have containers that die almost immediately, and may die and cleaned up before driver.WaitUntilStarted runs. The causes for container dying seems special for each test: * TestDockerDriver_Cleanup: hello-world image just emits a message and exits immediately * TestDockerDriver_ForcePull_RepoDigest: the busybox image in TestDockerDriver_ForcePull_RepoDigest test didn't support -p 0 argument * TestDockerDriver_Entrypoint: with the entrypoint being /bin/sh -c, the command needs to be the entire string; otherwise, it ignores the comments"
11149,consul: fix script checks exiting after 1 run,Fixes a regression caused in d335a82859ca2177bc6deda0c2c85b559daf2db3 The removal of the inner context made the remaining cancels cancel the outer context and cause script checks to exit prematurely.
11150,Kill all container processes on shutdown,"Currently, libcontainer-based executor, upon shutdown, kills the container initial process.  The children of the killed process remain running, and the executor is never marked as terminated until they do. Also, fix a case where we treat processes as successful, when proc.Wait() fails.  In some attempts, I was getting ""waitid no child processes"" errors and such error shouldn't get process to be considered successful."

11227,Use user provided image name to launch container,"This allows the container to be tagged with a user friendly image name (e.g. redis:3.2) rather than the image ID (e.g. sha256:87856cc39862cec77541d68382e4867d7ccb29a85a17221446c857ddaebca916). Useful for human debugging, as well as some debugging and image scanning tools. This risks two bad changes: 1. Discrepancy in image resolution between docker and Nomad's image loader.   * I checked the image creation paths in Nomad, and noticed that we either pulled the image or inspect the image with the user provided name.  A race in image tagging where the tag is modified between image loading and container creation. I, personally, don't think this case is cause for concern, as it is analogous to the task running a bit later.  As long as the image is still present, creating the container should be good."

This means watchNodeUpdates and watchNodeEvents may not be shutdown when Shutdown() exits. During nomad agent shutdown this does not matter. During tests this means a test may leak those goroutines or be unable to know when those goroutines have exited.

11333,Populate alloc stats API with device stats,"This change makes few compromises:   Looks up the devices associated with tasks at look up time.  Given that nomad alloc status is called rarely generally (compared to stats telemetry and general job reporting), it seems fine.  However, the lookup overhead grows bounded by number of tasks x total-host-devices, which can be significant.   client.Client performs the task devices->statistics lookup.  It passes self to alloc/task runners so they can look up the device statistics allocated to them.  Currently alloc/task runners are responsible for constructing the entire RPC response for stats  The alternatives for making task runners device statistics aware don't seem appealing (e.g. having task runners contain reference to hostStats)   On the alloc aggregation resource usage, I did a naive merging of task device statistics.  Personally, I question the value of such aggregation, compared to costs of struct duplication and bloating the response - but opted to be consistent in the API. With naive concatination, device instances from a single device group used by separate tasks in the alloc, would be aggregated in two separate device group statistics."

11393,Adjust streaming duration,This test expects 11 repeats of the same message emitted at intervals of 200ms; so we need more than 2 seconds to adjust for time sleep variations and the like.  So raising it to 3s here that should be enough.
11394,Handle time.Duration in mock,"Mock driver config uses time.Duration fields but we initialize them inconsistently, as time.Duration sometimes and as duration strings other times.  Previously, mapstructure handles it and does the right thing. This is no longer the case with MsgPack.  I could not find a good way to bring back old behavior without too much complexity.  MsgPack extended types weren't ideal here as we lose type information (e.g. int64 vs string), and the input is a generic map and not a MsgPack serialization of duration. As such, I went with the simple solution of declaring the config field as duration string, and panicing if the test doesn't pass a valid string. I found this to cause the smallest change in tests, but we can alternatively force all to be int64 instead."

11415,Run job deregistering in a single transaction,"Fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/4299 Upon investigating this case further, we determined the issue to be a race between applying JobBatchDeregisterRequest fsm operation and processing job-deregister evals. Processing job-deregister evals should wait until the FSM log message finishes applying, by using the snapshot index.  However, with JobBatchDeregister, any single individual job deregistering was applied accidentally incremented the snapshot index and resulted into processing job-deregister evals.  When a Nomad server receives an eval for a job in the batch that is yet to be deleted, we accidentally re-run it depending on the state of allocation. This change ensures that we delete deregister all of the jobs and inserts all evals in a single transactions, thus blocking processing related evals until deregistering complete."

The second group has count 3, max_parallel=1, and can be placed. Run this first and then update the second group to do a deployment.

11688,tests: test via ServeMux so http codes are set,
11689,client: expose task state to client,"The interesting decision in this commit was to expose AR's state and not a fully materialized Allocation struct. AR.clientAlloc builds an Alloc that contains the task state, so I considered simply memoizing and exposing that method. However, that would lead to AR having two awkwardly similar methods:  - Alloc() - which returns the server-sent alloc  - ClientAlloc() - which returns the fully materialized client alloc Since ClientAlloc() could be memoized it would be just as cheap to call as Alloc(), so why not replace Alloc() entirely? Replacing Alloc() entirely would require Update() to immediately materialize the task states on server-sent Allocs as there may have been local task state changes since the server received an Alloc update. This quickly becomes difficult to reason about: should Update hooks use the TaskStates? Are state changes caused by TR Update hooks immediately reflected in the Alloc? Should AR persist its copy of the Alloc? If so, are its TaskStates canonical or the TaskStates on TR? So! Forget that. Let's separate the static Allocation from the dynamic AR & TR state!  AR.Alloc() is for static Allocation access (often for the Job) AR.AllocState() is for the dynamic AR & TR runtime state (deployment    status, task states, etc).  If code needs to know the status of a task: AllocState() If code needs to know the names of tasks: Alloc() It should be very easy for a developer to reason about which method they should call and what they can do with the return values."

11693,tests: fix races caused by sharing a buffer,"httptest.ResponseRecorder exposes a bytes.Buffer which we were reading and writing concurrently to test streaming log APIs. This is a race, so I wrapped the struct in a lock with some helpers."
11694,tr: fix shutdown/destroy/WaitResult handling,"Multiple receivers raced for the WaitResult when killing tasks which could lead to a deadlock if the ""wrong"" receiver won. Wrap handlers in an ugly little proxy to avoid this. At first I wanted to push this into drivers, but the result is tied to the TR's handle lifecycle -- not the lifecycle of an alloc or task."
11695,client: do not inspect task state to follow logs,"""Ask forgiveness, not permission."" Instead of peaking at TaskStates (which are no longer updated on the AR.Alloc() view of the world) to only read logs for running tasks, just try to read the logs and improve the error handling if they don't exist. This should make log streaming less dependent on AR/TR behavior. Also fixed a race where the log streamer could exit before reading an error. This caused no logs or errors to be displayed sometimes when an error occurred."

11736,"implement stopping, destroying, and disk migration", Stopping an alloc is implemented via Updates but update hooks are   not run. Destroying an alloc is a best effort cleanup. AllocRunner destroy hooks implemented. Disk migration and blocking on a previous allocation exiting moved to   its own package to avoid cycles. Now only depends on alloc broadcaster   instead of also using a waitch. AllocBroadcaster now only drops stale allocations and always keeps the   latest version. Made AllocDir safe for concurrent use  Lots of internal contexts that are currently unused. Unsure if they should be used or removed.

Both these code paths would remove the job from the allocation. Now we use this to also add fields such as FollowupEvalID which did not normalize the job. This is only a performance enhancement. Ignore terminal allocs: Failed allocations are annotated with the followup Eval ID when one is created to replace the failed allocation. However, in the plan applier, when we check if allocations fit, these terminal allocations were not filtered. This could result in the plan being rejected if the node would be overcommited if the terminal allocations resources were considered."

This would undermine checks we had to reduce the number of evaluations created when the latest eval index was greater than any alloc change 2. Fix an issue where the blocking query code was using the incorrect index such that the index was higher than necassary. 3. Special case handling of blocked evaluation since the create/snapshot index is no particularly useful since they can be reblocked.

11969,Failed/paused deployments do not block migrations,"This PR changes behavior of the scheduler such that a task group with a deployment that is failed or paused will not cause the scheduler to skip migrations. The reason for this change is that it causes a bad UX when draining nodes with allocations that are part of a failed/paused deployment. These operations should not be coupled in any way and this remedies that. Prior behavior was still correct, but required either jobs to transistion to a healthy state or for the node to hit its drain deadline."

11983,config: accept CA PEM files with extra whitespace,Previously we did a validation pass over CA PEM files before calling Go's CertPool.AppendCertsFromPEM to provide more detailed error messages than the stdlib provides. Unfortunately our validation was overly strict and rejected valid CA files. This is actually the reason the stdlib PEM parser doesn't return meaningful errors: PEM files are extremely permissive and it's difficult to tell the difference between invalid data and valid metadata. This PR removes our custom validation as it would reject valid data and the extra error messages were not useful in diagnosing the error encountered.

11987,client: set host name when migrating over tls,Not setting the host name led the Go HTTP client to expect a certificate with a DNS-resolvable name. Since Nomad uses ${role}.${region}.nomad names ephemeral dir migrations were broken when TLS was enabled. Added an e2e test to ensure this doesn't break again as it's very difficult to test and the TLS configuration is very easy to get wrong.

12172,New layout helper for associating two elements vertically,"By default, blocks have a margin of 1.5em to create a consistent vertical rhythm. However, sometimes elements need to be associated with the element above them. In this cases, the gap between elements needs to be tighter. There are many ways to do this, but this approach asks the latter content to be marked as associative. The implication is that the association is with the previous block."

12183,Close multiplexer when context is cancelled,"Multiplexer continues to create rpc connections even when the context which is passed to the underlying rpc connections is cancelled by the server. This was causing #4413 - when a SIGHUP causes everything to reload, it uses context to cancel the underlying http/rpc connections so that they may come up with the new configuration. The multiplexer was not being cancelled properly so it would continue to create rpc connections and constantly fail, causing communication issues with other nomad agents. Fixes #4413"
12184,List the new region mirage env var in the environment file,

12222,The application route doesn't need to fetch namespaces,
12223,Sidestep a transpilation bug.,Default params don't make it into arguments which were being splatted into the call to super.
12224,Repeat the new namespace pattern for region,
12225,Clear up the data flow for namespaces,"This is incredibly tricky with query params, since there is a bundle of timing issues, lifecycle issues, missing features, and all around gotchas with query params. This solution has no observers and no instances of the system service being set from the jobs controller. The upside to this is no observers, much easier to follow logic, no more dependent key chain reactions."

12242,vendor: fix blake2b on non-amd64 archs,The blake2b package only includes an asm implementation for amd64. Other architectures use a generic Go implementation. Unfortunately appengine is one of those architectures and we explicitly ignore appengine when vendoring because it is an unsupported platform for Nomad. Commit 925ec07a4 started ignoring appengine to help trim down the vendor package. We now need to include appengine again - despite not building for it - just to avoid accidently breaking other archs we do support.

Sleeping for 970ms It would also delay tests for ~60s during the network information retry period. So skip this when net=none.

12929,consul: remove services with/without canary tags,Guard against Canary being set to false at the same time as an allocation is being stopped: this could cause RemoveTask to be called with the wrong Canary value and leaking a service. Deleting both Canary values is the safest route.
12930,consul: support canary tags for services,Also refactor Consul ServiceClient to take a struct instead of a massive set of arguments. Meant updating a lot of code but it should be far easier to extend in the future as you will only need to update a single struct instead of every single call site. Adds an e2e test for canary tags.

13024,api: never return EOF from Logs error chan,Closing the frames chan is the only race-free way to signal to receivers that all frames have been sent and no errors have occurred. If EOF is sent on error chan receivers may not receive the last frame (or frames since the chan is buffered) before receiving the error. Closing frames is the idiomatic way of signaling there is no more data to be read from a chan.

13093,Merge pull request #4196 from jvrplmlmn/driverContext/add-taskGroup-job-details,DriverContext: Add the TaskGroup and the Job name
13094,Update node-drain logging message to clearer for operators.,This change updates the console log message when performing a node drain and particulary when a node has marked all allocs for migration. Previously it logged 'drain complete' which was a little confusing to operators as the node is not drained at this point. Closes #4183
13095,Test coverage for the changes to the searchable mixin,

13114,consul: periodically reconcile services/checks,"Periodically sync services and checks from Nomad to Consul. This is mostly useful when testing with the Consul dev agent which does not persist state across restarts. However, this is a reasonable safety measure to prevent skew between Consul's state and Nomad's services+checks. Also modernized the test suite a bit."
13115,rkt: create parent cgroup to enable stats,Having the Nomad executor create parent cgroups that rkt is launched within allows the stats collection code used for the exec driver to Just Work. The only downside is that now the Nomad executor's resource utilization counts against the cgroups resource limits just as it does for the exec driver.

But I think the race was in one of two places: * The task could restart which could create new events * I think there could be a race between the updater's version of events   and alloc runners as updates are async I fixed both. Here's hoping that fixes this flaky test.

Since TLSSkipVerify has been supported since Consul 0.7.2, it's safe to relax our handling."

13880,Add #3958 to changelog,
13881,fix: disable swap for executor_linux allocations,"A comment in the nomad source code states that swapping for executor_linux allocations is disabled but it wasn't. Nomad wrote -1 to the memsw.limit_in_bytes cgroup file to disable swapping. This has the following problems: 1.) Writing -1 to the file does not disable swapping. It sets     the limit for memory and swap to unlimited. 2.) On common Linux distributions like Ubuntu 16.04 LTS the     memsw.limit_in_bytes cgroup file does not exist by default.     The memsw.limit_in_bytes file only exist if the Linux kernel is     build with CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP=yes and either     CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED=yes or when the kernel parameter     swapaccount=1 is passed during boot.     Most Linux distributions disable swap accounting by default because     of higher memory usage.     Nomad silently ignores if writing to the memsw.limit_in_bytes file     fails. The allocation succeeds, no message is logged to notify the     user. To ensure that disabling swap works on common Linux kernels, disable swapping by writing 0 to the memory.swappiness file. Using the memory.swappiness file only requires that the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_MEMCG=yes. This is the default in common Linux kernels."

14491,Update changelog for dot env vars,
14492,Update go-envparse to allow dots in env vars,Includes hashicorp/go-envparse#2
14493,Allow . in Environment Variable Names,"From https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/spec/aci.md:  environment (list of objects, optional) represents the app's environment variables (ACE can append). The listed objects must have two key-value pairs: name and value. The name must consist solely of letters, digits, and underscores '_' as outlined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition, with practical considerations dictating that the name may also include periods '.' and hyphens '-'. The value is an arbitrary string. These values are not evaluated in any way, and no substitutions are made.  Dotted environment variables are frequently used as a part of the Spring Boot pattern. (re: ZD-6116) This PR specifically doesn't address the conversion of hyphens (-) due to an issue with rkt [Nomad GH # 2358]."

14514,lxc: cleanup partially configured containers after errors in Start,"If there are any errors in container setup after c.Create() in Start(), the container will be left around, with no way to clean it up because the handle will not be created or returned from Start. Added a wrapper that checks for errors and performs appropriate cleanup. Returning a cleanup function from a wrapped function instead of just doing the cleanup before returning the error helps to ensure that future changes that might add or change error exits can't forget to consider a cleanup function. Adds a check to the invalid config test case to check that a container created with an invalid config doesn't get left behind. Signed-off-by: Michael McCracken mikmccra@cisco.com"
14515,Add changelog entry for #3682,
14516,Drop log level to TRACE,For people not using driver networks these log lines would just be confusing.
14517,Improve invalid port error message for services,Related to #3681 If a user specifies an invalid port label when using address_mode=driver they'll get an error message about the label being an invalid number which is very confusing. I also added a bunch of testing around Service.AddressMode validation since I was concerned by the linked issue that there were cases I was missing. Unfortunately when address_mode=driver is used there's only so much validation that can be done as structs/structs.go validation never peeks into the driver config which would be needed to verify the port labels/map.
14518,Improve driver network logging,
14519,Fix test,
14520,Always advertise driver IP when in driver mode,Fixes #3681 When in drive address mode Nomad should always advertise the driver's IP in Consul even when no network exists. This matches the 0.6 behavior. When in host address mode Nomad advertises the alloc's network's IP if one exists. Otherwise it lets Consul determine the IP. I also added some much needed logging around Docker's network discovery.

14730,Merge pull request #3657 from jrasell/patch-4,Update template.html.md Vault template example
14731,Update template.html.md Vault template example,The change updates the Vault example within the Environment Variables section to use the .value notation rather than the .key notation. This is because the example is calling a specific secret key and populating an env var with this; meaning the value of the secret is required over the value.
14732,Skip tests that require root when not root,"Also skip Chown on allocdir migration on Windows and when non-root. Windows doesn't support it, and it will always fail as a non-root user."

14758,Use the Service.Hash() method in agent service ids,"The allocID and taskName parameters are useless for agents, but it's still nice to reuse the same hash method for agent and task services. This brings in the lowercase mode for the agent hash as well."

14767,Merge pull request #3619 from hashicorp/f-3380-custom-ports,Allow custom ports for services and checks when using driver address_mode

14773,Improve validation and testing of service/check ports,
14774,Expand port and address_mode docs,
14775,Be more defensive in port checks,
14776,Move service hash logic to Service.Hash method,
14777,Hash fields used in task service IDs,"Fixes #3620 Previously we concatenated tags into task service IDs. This could break deregistration of tag names that contained double //s like some Fabio tags. This change breaks service ID backward compatibility so on upgrade all users services and checks will be removed and re-added with new IDs. This change has the side effect of including all service fields in the ID's hash, so we no longer have to track PortLabel and AddressMode changes independently."
14778,Improve port label validation and diff testing,
14779,Prevent using port 0 with address_mode=driver,
14780,Validate port label for host address mode,"Also skip getting an address for script checks which don't use them. Fixed a weird invalid reserved port in a TaskRunner test helper as well as a problem with our mock Alloc/Job. Hopefully the latter doesn't cause other tests to fail, but we were referencing an invalid PortLabel and just not catching it before."
14781,Add Using Driver Address Mode docs,
14782,Document service/check address_mode/port changes,
14783,Fix interpolation bug with service/check updates,"Previously if only an interpolated variable used in a service or check was changed we interpolated the old and new services and checks with the new variable, so nothing appeared to have changed."
14784,Test Consul from TaskRunner thoroughly,Rely less on the mockConsulServiceClient because the real consul.ServiceClient needs all the testing it can get!
14785,Allow custom ports for services and checks,"Fixes #3380 Adds address_mode to checks (but no auto) and allows services and checks to set literal port numbers when using address_mode=driver. This allows SDNs, overlays, etc to advertise internal and host addresses as well as do checks against either."

14860,Fix race in framer and improperly returned err,Fixes #3342 Two bugs were fixed:  Closing the StreamFramer's exitCh before setting the error means other   goroutines blocked on exitCh closing could see the error as nil. This   was not observered. parseFramerError on Windows would fall through and return an   improperly captured nil err variable. There's no need for   parseFramerError to be a closure which fixes the confusion.

Levant is an open source templating and deployment tool for HashiCorp Nomad jobs that provides realtime feedback and detailed failure messages upon deployment issues. Further details about Levant can be seen on the jrasell/levant GitHub page.
14894,Changed Superset to only return the resource name,"The Superset method on Resources used to return a string in the format of “[resource name] exhausted”. This was leading to the output in plan/create job API DimensionExhausted to return keys like ""DimensionExhausted"": {""cpu exhausted"": 1} This was not anywhere documented, however, one of the examples on the website showed it like this. The other side effect of this is that the CLI formats the strings from the name of the key leading to output like * Dimension ""cpu exhausted"" exhausted on 1 nodes"

15005,Handle leader task being dead in RestoreState,"Fixes the panic mentioned in https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3420#issuecomment-341666932 While a leader task dying serially stops all follower tasks, the synchronizing of state is asynchrnous. Nomad can shutdown before all follower tasks have updated their state to dead thus saving the state necessary to hit this panic: have a non-terminal alloc with a dead leader. The actual fix is a simple nil check to not assume non-terminal allocs leader's have a TaskRunner."
15006,Dropped loglevel for AWS fingerprinter env reads,"Certain environments use WARN for serious logging; however, it's very possible to have machines without some of the fingerprinted keys (public-ipv4 and public-hostname specifcally).

15680,Ignore rkt network failure if container died early,"If the container dies before the network can be read, we now ignore the error coming out of the network information polling loop. Nomad will restart the task regardless, so we might be masking the actual error. The polling loop for the rkt network information, inside the Start method, was getting a bit unwieldy. It's been refactored out so it's not a seperate function."
15681,Make rkt port mapping test not exit immediately,"The rkt port mapping test currently starts redis with --version, which obviously makes redis exit again almost immediately. This means that the container exists before the network status can be queried, and so the test fails."

This matches the Docker behavior. If no port map is specified, the warnings will be logged but the task will be allowed to start."
15707,Test for rkt driver setting DriverNetwork,"To test that the rkt driver correctly sets a DriverNetwork, at least when a port mapping is requested, we amend the TestRktDriver_PortsMapping test with a small check."

15733,Expose rkt DriverNetwork,"Currently the rkt driver does not expose a DriverNetwork instance after starting the container, which means that address_mode = 'driver' does not work. To get the container network information, we can call rkt status on the UUID of the container and grab the container IP from there. For the port map, we need to grab the pod manifest as it will tell us which ports the container exposes. We then cross-reference the configured port name with the container port names, and use that to create a correct port mapping. To avoid doing a (bad) reimplementation of the appc schema(which rkt uses for its manifest) and rkt apis, we pull those in as vendored dependencies. The versions used are the same ones that rkt use in their glide dependency configuration for version 1.28.0."
15734,Use rkt prepare + run-prepared instead of run.,"The rkt driver currently executes run and asks that the pod UUID is written to a file that is then polled for changes for up to five seconds. Many container fetches will take longer than this, so this method will often not be able to track the pod UUID reliably. To avoid this problem, rkt allows pods to be first prepared, which will return their UUID, and then run as a second invocation. Here we convert the rkt driver's Start method to use this method instead. This way, the UUID will always be tracked correctly."

15845,RestartDelay isn't needed as checks are re-added on restarts,@dadgar made the excellent observation in #3105 that TaskRunner removes and re-registers checks on restarts. This means checkWatcher doesn't need to do any internal restart tracking. Individual checks can just remove themselves and be re-added when the task restarts.
15846,Simplify from 2 select loops to one,

15878,Non-locked accessors to common Node fields,"This PR removes locking around commonly accessed node attributes that do not need to be locked. The locking could cause nodes to TTL as the heartbeat code path was acquiring a lock that could be held for an excessively long time. An example of this is when Vault is inaccessible, since the fingerprint is run with a lock held but the Vault fingerprinter makes the API calls with a large timeout.

15952,build: Rework Vagrant to support multiple OS boxes,"This commit reworks the Vagrantfile for Nomad in order to support straightforward testing on more than one operating system, whilst retaining the ability to stand up a test cluster running Ubuntu. The following changes are made:   Scripts have been extracted from the Vagrantfile into their own shell   script files, in order that editors lint them.   All scripts have been edited to lint with no warnings or errors for   their respective shells.   Scripts are named according to the operating system and privilege   level which they run. We prefer to run a whole shell script as root   versus prefixing (essentially) every command with sudo or an   equivalent.   The Linux development box has been separated from the test cluster,   removing some of the more gnarly (and less portable) logic. The Linux   development box is still primary and autostarts.   A FreeBSD target has been added. The base box works for both   Virtualbox and VMWare Fusion.   A target is added to the GNUmakefile to stand up a test cluster, using   the default provider, or overriding the provider by setting the PROVIDER   variable in make:  make testcluster make testcluster PROVIDER=vmware_fusion    Machines in the test cluster have Avahi configured for zeroconf   discovery. Each machine can ping each other machine at hostname.local  for example nomad-server02.local, nomad-client03.local."

16296,build: Replace shell scripts with GNUmakefile,"This commit replaces the shell script-driven build process for Nomad with one based around GNU Make (note we do use GNU-specific constructs), requiring no additional scripts for common cases of development. The following targets are implemented: Per-OS/arch combinations: Binaries (Host - Mac OS X): pkg/darwin_amd64/nomad  Binaries (Host - Linux): pkg/linux_386/nomad pkg/linux_amd64/nomad pkg/linux_amd64-lxc/nomad pkg/linux_arm/nomad pkg/linux_arm64/nomad pkg/windows_386/nomad pkg/windows_amd64/nomad  Packages (Host - Mac OS X): pkg/darwin_amd64.zip  Packages (Host - Linux): pkg/linux_386.zip pkg/linux_amd64.zip pkg/linux_amd64-lxc.zip pkg/linux_arm.zip pkg/linux_arm64.zip pkg/windows_386.zip pkg/windows_amd64.zip  Phony targets: dev - Builds for the current host GOOS/GOARCH (unless overriden       in the environment)  release - Builds all appropriate release packages for the           current host GOOS/GOARCH (i.e. Windows and Linux       packages on a Linux host, Darwin packages on an OSX       host)  generate - Generate code for the current host architecture using            `go generate`.  test - Runs the Nomad test suite  clean - Removes build artifacts  travis - Runs `make test` with the wrapper script to prevent          Travis CI from timing out.  help - Displays usage information about commonly used targets.  Note that there are some semantic differences from the previous version.   generate is no longer a dependency of dev builds. This is because    it causes a rebuild every time, even when no code has changed, since    go generate does not appear to leave file timestamps alone.    Regardless, it is insufficient to generate on one host OS - it needs    to be run on each target to ensure everything is generated correctly.   gofmt is no longer checked. This should be enabled as a linter once    the gofmt -s refactoring will pass on the whole code base, in order    to avoid special cased checks versus using go-metalinter.   Example Usages: Make a development build for the current GOOS/GOARCH: make dev  Make release build packages appropriate for the host OS: make release  Update generated code for the host OS: make generate  Run linting checks: make check  Build a specific alternative GOOS/GOARCH/tags combination: make pkg/linux_amd64-pkg/nomad make pkg/linux_amd64-pkg.zip"

16397,Vendor vault test deps,This is a weird one because make bootstrap does a go get vault so CI never fails due to missing Vault dependencies. However developer machines will have whatever version of vault they grabbed last time they bootstrapped a new dev environment. This can lead to surprising build issues and different devs testing slightly different code. So let's vendor all test deps to try to keep the Nomad repo self-contained.

This is important because the destructive change may be due to a lowering of resources. If this is the case, the handling of the destructive changes first may make it possible for the placement to happen. To reason about this imagine there is one node with CPU = 500. If the group originally had: * count = 1 * cpu = 400 And then the job was updated such that the group had: * count = 4 * cpu = 120 If the original alloc isn't discounted first, nothing would be able to place."

16776,Never remove unknown agent services,"Fixes #2827 This is a tradeoff. The pro is that you can run separate client and server agents on the same node and advertise both. The con is that if a Nomad agent crashes and isn't restarted on that node in the same mode its entry will not be cleaned up. That con scenario seems far less likely to occur than the scenario on the pro side, and even if we do leak an agent entry the checks will be failing so nothing should attempt to use it."

16782,Fix deadlock caused by syncing during destroy,"When replacing an alloc the new alloc is blocked until the old alloc is destroyed. This could cause a deadlock:  Destroying the old alloc includes a final sync of its status Syncing status causes a GC A GC looks for terminal allocs to cleanup The GC waits for an alloc to stop completely before GC'ing  If the GC chooses the currently-being-destroyed-alloc to GC, the GC deadlocks. If client.max_parallel deadlocks happen the GC is wedged until the Nomad process is restarted. Performing the final sync asynchronously is an ugly hack but prevents the deadlock by allowing the final sync to occur after the alloc runner has shutdown and been destroyed."

Log lines always need to include the alloc ID, so we often skipped acquiring a lock just to grab the ID and accepted the race. Let's make the race detector a little happier by storing the ID in a single assignment field."
16791,Fix log level,
16792,Don't fail if task dirs don't exist on creation,Task dir metadata is created in AllocRunner.Run which may not run before an alloc is sync'd and Nomad exits. There's no reason not to just create task dir metadata on restore if it doesn't exist.

17034,Properly normalize IPv6 addresses,A fix to #2739 instead of forcing IPv6 users to always specify a port as well. Prior to this commit IPv6 advertise addresses which lacked a port would fail instead of having the default port added because net.SplitHostPort(someipv6) returns a different error than net.SplitHostPort(someipv4).

17040,System jobs should be running until stopped,Prior to this commit they would be marked as dead if they had no currently running allocations -- even though they would spring back to life (running) if the cluster state changed such that a new eval+alloc was created.
17041,Noted that ephemeral storage size not enforced,"This value is strictly used in the job placement, but is not enforced like a quota"
17042,Ephemeral Disks: migrate requires sticky,The migrate option is a no-op when sticky is set to false
17043,Validate job updates,Incurs a local read-before-write but because validation is transitive there's no need to retry the read-validate-write on concurrent updates.
17044,Do not fail when no docker registry auth is available,this amends the behaviour introduced with #2651 and allows pulling public images when docker.auth.helper is set

This would have made for a nasty surprise the next time we updated consul/api.

17242,Fix Vault Client panic when given nonexistant role,The Vault API returns a nil secret and nil error when reading an object that doesn't exist. The old code assumed an error would be returned and thus will panic when trying to validate a non-existant role.

Errors here are only an issue if:  * Consul is being used but is down or misbehaving  * The executor is old (<0.6)  * The task has services  * The services hit a pre-0.6 consul.Syncer bug If all of those conditions are met the pre-0.6 bugs will persist for this task until Nomad is restarted.

The Nomad client agent now handles all Consul operations instead of the executor handling task related operations. When upgrading from an earlier version of Nomad existing executors will be told to deregister from Consul so that the Nomad agent can re-register the task's services and checks. Drivers - other than qemu - now support an Exec method for executing abritrary commands in a task's environment. This is used to implement script checks. Interfaces are used extensively to avoid interacting with Consul in tests that don't assert any Consul related behavior.

17791,Merge pull request #2376 from hashicorp/b-fix-restore-errors,Fix two issues during client restore state
17792,Fix two issues during client restore state,This PR fixes two issues: 1) A close of a nil stopCollection channel when restoring and prestart fails. The failure will cause the killCh to be triggered which will close collection before it has been initialized. 2) Fixes a deadlock in which the handleWaitCh is never triggered since it is not initialized when there is an error in prestart and the killCh is triggered. Both fixes are by maintaining the loop invariant that the two channels are valid after there is a handle.

17870,Fix allocdir Move test and make code more defensive,"A change in the behavior of os.Rename in Go 1.8 brought to light a difference in the logic between {Alloc,Task}Runner and this test: AllocRunner builds the alloc dir, moves dirs if necessary, and then lets TaskRunner call TaskDir.Build(). This test called TaskDir.Build before AllocDir.Move, so in Go 1.8 it failed to os.Rename over the empty {data,local} dirs. I updated the test to behave like the real code, but I defensively added os.Remove calls as a subtle change in call order shouldn't break this code. os.Remove won't remove a non-empty directory, so it's still safe."

I don't think we want to try to support cross-compiling LXC from non-Linux hosts."

18311,GetAllocs uses a blocking query,"This PR makes GetAllocs use a blocking query as well as adding a sanity check to the clients watchAllocation code to ensure it gets the correct allocations. This PR fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2119 and https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2153. The issue was that the client was talking to two different servers, one to check which allocations to pull and the other to pull those allocations.  However the latter call was not with a blocking query and thus the client would not retreive the allocations it requested. The logging has been improved to make the problem more clear as well."
18312,Switch to a less timing dependent test command,/usr/bin/yes could produce output very quickly (100s of MBps on my laptop) and therefore could cause log files to roll over. A bash loop with a sleep avoids that issue. The test is slower but should be much more resilient to the massive timing differences between workstations and Travis.

18362,Fix race when shutting down in dev mode,Client.Shutdown holds the allocLock when destroying alloc runners in dev mode. Client.updateAllocStatus can be called during AllocRunner shutdown and calls getAllocRunners which tries to acquire allocLock.RLock. This deadlocks since Client.Shutdown already has the write lock. Switching Client.Shutdown to use getAllocRunners and not hold a lock during AllocRunner shutdown is the solution.

This doesn't work on Docker For Mac because the docker daemon is running inside a VM, and while /tmp is accessible, the filesystem used to share them doesn't support unix socket files, and thus it doesn't work."
18998,Resolve alloc/state directories to make Docker For Mac happy," In -dev mode, ioutil.TempDir is used for the alloc and state directories. TempDir uses $TMPDIR, which os OS X contains a per user directory which is under /var/folder. /var is actually a symlink to /private/var Docker For Mac validates the directories that are passed to bind and on OS X. That whitelist contains /private, but not /var. It does not expand the path, and so any paths in $TMPDIR fail the whitelist check.  And thusly, by expanding the alloc/state directories the value passed for binding does contain /private and Docker For Mac is happy."

19063,Fixed a bug when giving in another logging driver than syslog.,"Before this commit, if the Logging config did not contain a logging option ""syslog-address"", it would definitely insert this option. If then, you decide to take another logdriver than syslog, docker would fail because it received a wrong log option for the selected driver. Now, nomad will only insert the syslog address in a hard way if there are no logging options at all - this way it keeps the default nomad settings."
19064,"Added support to mount host folders into container. For example if you don't want to bake certificates into the container, you can mount them into the directory directly.","Furthermore, I added support for volumes-from. Currently, there is no support to move the data from one container to another, hence: If a container spawns on another host, it is very likely, that the data will not be found."

19124,Update the sample jobfile syntax," Uses spaces instead of tabs for the sample job file. Even though Nomad   is written in Go, the HCL style guide uses two spaces for indentation,   and this will match Terraform and Vault in terms of configuration. Locks to redis:3.2 instead of floating latest. Running latest in   production is a bad idea and we shouldn't encourage it even via   example. Removes the linux constraint (native docker exists for both Mac and   Windows now)  Aligns equal signs and stuff as per the HCL formatter   Closes #1743 "
19125,Convert example job file constraint to comment,"This improves the ""getting started"" happy path experience for non-linux users who are running the native Docker tools on their machines. There is no need to constrain this job to linux, since driver detection for docker will already (basically) do this."

Consul Discovery is now triggered with a chan instead of using a timer and deadline to trigger. Once discovery is complete a chan is ticked so all goroutines waiting for servers will run. Should speed up bootstraping and recovery while decreasing spinning on timers.

With this change, the ID will also be available when using Jobs().Info(), which returns api.Job. In fact, ParentID is currently the only field present in api.JobListStub that is not part of api.Job. Note: This has the side effect that nomad run -output will now include an empty ParentID."

When 3x the heartbeatTTL has been exceeded, append the Consul server list to the primary primary server list.  When the next RPCProxy rebalance occurs, there is a chance one of the servers discovered from Consul will be in the majority. When client reattaches to a Nomad Server in the majority, it will include a heartbeat and will reset the TTLs AND will clear the primary server list to include only values from the heartbeat."

20323,Move package client/consul/sync to command/agent/consul.,"This has been done to allow the Server and Client to reuse the same Syncer because the Agent may be running Client, Server, or both simultaneously and we only want one Syncer object alive in the agent."
20324,Rename Syncer.SetServiceIdentifier to SetServiceRegPrefix(),"This attribute isn't actually an identifier because it can represent a collection of services.  Rename serviceIdentifier to `serviceRegPrefix which more accurately conveys the intention of this Syncer attribute. While here, also rename SetServiceIdentifier() to SetServiceRegPrefix() and GenerateServiceIdentifier() to GenerateServicePrefix()."
20325,Change the API signature of Syncer.SyncServices().,"SyncServices() immediately attempts to sync whatever information the process has with Consul.  Previously this method would take an argument of the exclusive list of services that should exist, however this is not condusive to having a Nomad Client and Nomad Server share the same consul.Syncer."
20326,Change the signature of the PeriodicCallback to return an error,"I KNEW I should have done this when I wrote it, but didn't want to go back and audit the handlers to include the appropriate return handling, but now that the code is taking shape, make this change."
20327,Rename structs.Services to structs.ConsulServices,
20328,Refine Nomad's Consul port handling.,"Previously this would immediately default to '127.0.0.1' if the config was set to :some-port-number.  Now it uses the BindAddr if available.  Also, if the port option is set to just a port` number (e.g. '1234'), attempt to parse the port number by itself to allow statically configured ports to work, even when no host is specified."
20329,Rename createCheck() to createDelegatedCheck() for clarity,
20330,Change client/consul.NewSyncer() to accept a shutdown channel,"In addition to the API changing, consul.Syncer can now be signaled to shutdown via the Shutdown() method, which will call the Run()'ing sync task to exit gracefully."

20340,Fix up the comments,Pointed out by: @dadgar
20341,Make the locking protocol more explicit in client.NewClient,"With an over abundance of caution, preevnt future copy/pasta by using the right locks when bootstrapping a Client.

20363,Fix the client/rpcproxy unit tests.,
20364,Change the endpoint for /v1/agent/servers and fix tests.,"When an agent is running a server, the list of servers includes the Raft peers.  When the agent is running a client (which is always the case?), include a list of the servers found in the Client's RpcProxy. Dedupe and provide a unique list back to the caller."
20365,Provide a default ConsulConfig for client/config.DefaultConfig(),"Change the unit test to only test if the consul link exists, not the value of the link.  The old test was hostname specific and therefore would always be different based on the environment running the tests."
20366,Move client.DefaultConfig() to client/config.DefaultConfig(),Resolves an import cycle in testing and is more appropriate because the default should reside next to its struct definition.
20367,Fix a comment to be more correct,
20368,Unused code wasn't as unused as I thought.  Restore.,

20388,"Register two services each for clients and servers, http and rpc.","In order to give clients a fighting chance to talk to the right port, differentiate RPC services from HTTP services by registering two services with different tags.

This caused all of our nomad jobs to be allocated to a single nomad-client instead of being spread evenly across our clients. The only way to discover this was to run nomad node-status <node> and count each job allocation per node. This can lead to a fairly long debugging process if there are several nomad-clients. Including the number of allocations for each node in the node-status command would save a large amount of debug time. jake@biscuits [12:08:41] [~] -> % nomad node-status ID        Datacenter  Name      Class   Drain  Status  Allocations 2b0aabc5  dc1         biscuits  <none>  false  ready   0 jake@biscuits [12:08:55] [~] -> % nomad node-status ID        Datacenter  Name      Class   Drain  Status  Allocations 2b0aabc5  dc1         biscuits  <none>  false  ready   1"
