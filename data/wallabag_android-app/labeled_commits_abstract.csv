1763,Improve checks for Wallabag v2 instance.,0.55906844,Better tests for connexion issues,"This commit fixes #221 and some more issue w.r.t. toggle actions on an article. In wallabag v2 if we request a toggle action, e.g. /star/123, and if we are not logged in anymore, we get redirected to that action after successful login. But our app then did re-toggle that action. Therefore the action had been called twice. When deleting an article this resulted in a 404. When starring or archiving, this toggled the action twice --> resulting in no action. So now if we recognize that we executing an action results in a login page, we request a new login page, do a clean login and afterwards recall the action request. This way we avoid getting redirected to the action request.",0
