907,Adjust text color in navigation bar,"Because the space behind the items isn't black anymore, a grey was used as the icon and text color of the selected navbar item. Fixes #552"
908,Use right color for dark contrast theme,Use a real black instead of grey in the dark contrast theme for the app bar. Also remove the black square in the navigation bar for the selected item and instead use grey to highlight it. This was done by changing the primary color of the theme and not changing the background attribute in the theme to not always be black.

1743,Fixes #221 Deleting an articles throws a 404 error,"This commit fixes #221 and some more issue w.r.t. toggle actions on an article. In wallabag v2 if we request a toggle action, e.g. /star/123, and if we are not logged in anymore, we get redirected to that action after successful login. But our app then did re-toggle that action. Therefore the action had been called twice. When deleting an article this resulted in a 404. When starring or archiving, this toggled the action twice --> resulting in no action. So now if we recognize that we executing an action results in a login page, we request a new login page, do a clean login and afterwards recall the action request. This way we avoid getting redirected to the action request."
1744,Fixes #218 Titles show encoding problems,"This commit fixes #218, where a title of an article was html encoded.
