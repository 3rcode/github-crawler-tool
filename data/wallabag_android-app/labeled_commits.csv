A rudimentary method to execute serializable (ActionRequest-based) tasks. All basic article operations don't block UI anymore   (except rare stuff like purging DB from settings).",1

In wallabag v2 if we request a toggle action, e.g. /star/123, and if we are not logged in anymore, we get redirected to that action after successful login. But our app then did re-toggle that action. Therefore the action had been called twice. When deleting an article this resulted in a 404. When starring or archiving, this toggled the action twice --> resulting in no action.
