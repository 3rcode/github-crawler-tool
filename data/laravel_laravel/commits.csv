Accordingly, the schema configuration key should be changed to search_path to better reflect the fact that it may specify a list of schemata (schemas), and not just a single schema. (In several Laravel versions prior to 9.0, the schema key could already specify more than one schema, but this fact was undocumented and non-obvious without examining the implementation carefully.) As of Laravel 9.0, the search_path may specify any number of schemata, in any of the following formats: 'search_path' => 'public', 'search_path' => 'public,laravel', 'search_path' => ['public', '""laravel""', ""'foobar'"", '$bat'], 'search_path' => '\'public\', ""laravel"", ""\'foobar\'"", \'$bat\'', 'search_path' => '""$user"", public', Note that in the last example, the $user variable refers to PostgreSQL's special $user variable, as described in the Schema Documentation ( https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html ). Note also that Laravel's default search_path value, 'public', is not necessarily the best choice for every use case. Developers should consult the ""Usage Patterns"" section of the aforementioned documentation before deciding how best to set the search_path, as it has security implications.",Replace schema with search_path in pgsql config (#5726),"Per link , the term ""schema"" (a namespace) has been corrected to ""search_path"" (a list of namespaces), where appropriate, throughout the framework.

When the developer needs to set the value of an environment variable to a value containing a space, as none of the existing values in .env are quoted, the developer is unlikely to wrap this new value with spaces in quotes. This will result in an error, as The vlucas/phpdotenv library throws an error when setting an environment variable to a value with a space. Quote all default environment variables by default, reducing the likelihood of the developer ever receiving the error relating to environment variables needing to be quoted when they contain spaces. This excludes true, null etc. even though wrapping them in quotes would still result in the desired behaviour, as it is more intuitive to see these special types not wrapped in quotes. The current default values in .env.example don't contain any spaces, so this commit will make no difference out of the box; its only purpose is to help out the developer further down the line on the day when they need to set an environment variable to a value containing spaces. Also, the vlucas/phpdotenv library docs currently uses quoted variables in every example, so quoting .env.example's values will lead to more consistency with those docs.
