Now for regular development you just need to run docker-compose up --build and only in you CI you would build and run for production by explicitly naming the yml files.

[8.x] Add option to set sendmail path. Fix default (#5741),0.827848,Add option to set sendmail path (#5741)," Add option to set sendmail path. Fix default  Testing this in an application, it would seem that sendmail -bs is the wrong option for this case? What Laravel appears to do is pipe an RFC-2822 formatted message on STDIN and requires the sendmail emulation to deal with it, rather than -bs which initiates an SMTP session. if Exim is the default MTA then -t would seem to be the correct option. If you have an alternative installed instead of sendmail/exim, then there's no way to set the path, so I added MAIL_SENDMAIL_PATH so you can do, e.g.: MAIL_SENDMAIL_PATH=""/usr/bin/msmtp -t --tls=off --from=${MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS} --auto-from=off"" msmtp doesn't support -bs at all  Update mail.php  Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",1

Replace schema with search_path in pgsql config (#5726),0.3940558,Use generic default db config (6f3d68f),"Per https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/35588 , the term ""schema"" (a namespace) has been corrected to ""search_path"" (a list of namespaces), where appropriate, throughout the framework. Accordingly, the schema configuration key should be changed to search_path to better reflect the fact that it may specify a list of schemata (schemas), and not just a single schema. (In several Laravel versions prior to 9.0, the schema key could already specify more than one schema, but this fact was undocumented and non-obvious without examining the implementation carefully.) As of Laravel 9.0, the search_path may specify any number of schemata, in any of the following formats: 'search_path' => 'public', 'search_path' => 'public,laravel', 'search_path' => ['public', '""laravel""', ""'foobar'"", '$bat'], 'search_path' => '\'public\', ""laravel"", ""\'foobar\'"", \'$bat\'', 'search_path' => '""$user"", public', Note that in the last example, the $user variable refers to PostgreSQL's special $user variable, as described in the Schema Documentation ( https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html ). Note also that Laravel's default search_path value, 'public', is not necessarily the best choice for every use case. Developers should consult the ""Usage Patterns"" section of the aforementioned documentation before deciding how best to set the search_path, as it has security implications.",0

If using php artisan preset it will use PHP's JSON_PRETTY_PRINT to rewrite the file (https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/master/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/Presets/Preset.php#L44). JSON_PRETTY_PRINT uses four spaces for indentation, causing the entire file contents to be altered upon a diff.

Wrap .env.example variable values in quotes,0.5851658,Add env variable (e1b8847),"When the developer copies .env.example to .env they are unlikely to add quotes to the values in .env. When the developer needs to set the value of an environment variable to a value containing a space, as none of the existing values in .env are quoted, the developer is unlikely to wrap this new value with spaces in quotes. This will result in an error, as The vlucas/phpdotenv library throws an error when setting an environment variable to a value with a space. Quote all default environment variables by default, reducing the likelihood of the developer ever receiving the error relating to environment variables needing to be quoted when they contain spaces. This excludes true, null etc. even though wrapping them in quotes would still result in the desired behaviour, as it is more intuitive to see these special types not wrapped in quotes. The current default values in .env.example don't contain any spaces, so this commit will make no difference out of the box; its only purpose is to help out the developer further down the line on the day when they need to set an environment variable to a value containing spaces. Also, the vlucas/phpdotenv library docs currently uses quoted variables in every example, so quoting .env.example's values will lead to more consistency with those docs. This will likely stop any confusion for the developer when reading the vlucas/phpdotenv docs. See laravel/framework#14586, laravel/docs#2223",0

To verify, set application.ssl to false (without this patch) then run: Cookie::put('foo', 'bar', 0, '/', null, true);  You will get an exception because of line 90 in cookie.php:     if ($secure and ! Request::secure())     {         throw new \Exception(""Attempting to set secure cookie over HTTP."");     }  With this patch you will not get this error unless both application.ssl is true, and the cookie $secure flag is set.",0

It was never evaluating as the route that you specified when executing the command. This could be part of a larger underlying bug with Symfony's HttpFoundation\Request class. It might be a band-aid fix, but replacing URI::current() with $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] allows the method to run the correct route. These fixes uncovered what I believe is potentially another bug.
