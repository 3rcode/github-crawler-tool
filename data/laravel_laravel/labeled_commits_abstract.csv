E.g. a common setup would be like this: docker-compose.yml: services shared across builds docker-compose.override.yml: services only used in development docker-compose.production.yml: configuration needed for building production images. Now for regular development you just need to run docker-compose up --build and only in you CI you would build and run for production by explicitly naming the yml files. TL;DR: Excluding docker-compose.override.yml seems to be a personal preference of someone and they should do that in their global .gitignore if the are so inclined.",0

Fix default Testing this in an application, it would seem that sendmail -bs is the wrong option for this case? What Laravel appears to do is pipe an RFC-2822 formatted message on STDIN and requires the sendmail emulation to deal with it, rather than -bs which initiates an SMTP session. if Exim is the default MTA then -t would seem to be the correct option. If you have an alternative installed instead of sendmail/exim, then there's no way to set the path, so I added MAIL_SENDMAIL_PATH so you can do, e.g.: MAIL_SENDMAIL_PATH=""/usr/bin/msmtp -t --tls=off --from=${MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS} --auto-from=off"" msmtp doesn't support -bs at all Update mail.php Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",1

293,Add sponsor.,0.43112975,Add ably entry (5182e9c),"Per link , the term ""schema"" (a namespace) has been corrected to ""search_path"" (a list of namespaces), where appropriate, throughout the framework. Accordingly, the schema configuration key should be changed to search_path to better reflect the fact that it may specify a list of schemata (schemas), and not just a single schema. (In several Laravel versions prior to 9.0, the schema key could already specify more than one schema, but this fact was undocumented and non-obvious without examining the implementation carefully.) As of Laravel 9.0, the search_path may specify any number of schemata, in any of the following formats: 'search_path' => 'public', 'search_path' => 'public,laravel', 'search_path' => ['public', '""laravel""', ""'foobar'"", '$bat'], 'search_path' => '\'public\', ""laravel"", ""\'foobar\'"", \'$bat\'', 'search_path' => '""$user"", public', Note that in the last example, the $user variable refers to PostgreSQL's special $user variable, as described in the Schema Documentation ( link ). Note also that Laravel's default search_path value, 'public', is not necessarily the best choice for every use case. Developers should consult the ""Usage Patterns"" section of the aforementioned documentation before deciding how best to set the search_path, as it has security implications.",0

1929,fixing a bug and cleaning.,0.4456464,Clean up auto register Vue components (#4854),"When the developer copies .env.example to .env they are unlikely to add quotes to the values in .env. When the developer needs to set the value of an environment variable to a value containing a space, as none of the existing values in .env are quoted, the developer is unlikely to wrap this new value with spaces in quotes. This will result in an error, as The vlucas/phpdotenv library throws an error when setting an environment variable to a value with a space. Quote all default environment variables by default, reducing the likelihood of the developer ever receiving the error relating to environment variables needing to be quoted when they contain spaces. This excludes true, null etc. even though wrapping them in quotes would still result in the desired behaviour, as it is more intuitive to see these special types not wrapped in quotes. The current default values in .env.example don't contain any spaces, so this commit will make no difference out of the box; its only purpose is to help out the developer further down the line on the day when they need to set an environment variable to a value containing spaces. Also, the vlucas/phpdotenv library docs currently uses quoted variables in every example, so quoting .env.example's values will lead to more consistency with those docs. This will likely stop any confusion for the developer when reading the vlucas/phpdotenv docs. See laravel/framework#14586, laravel/docs#2223",0

It was never evaluating as the route that you specified when executing the command. This could be part of a larger underlying bug with Symfony's HttpFoundation\Request class. It might be a band-aid fix, but replacing URI::current() with $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] allows the method to run the correct route. These fixes uncovered what I believe is potentially another bug. When var_dump($route->response()) is run, ""NULL"" and a newline is appended to the output. It's something to do with var_dump(), as echo $route->response() echo's the correct output without the extra ""NULL"". Signed-off-by: Jakobud jake.e.wilson@gmail.com",0
