Create a github workflow that runs the script in the CI. The script accepts --whitelist  and --import-gpg-keys arguments. The default settings are supposed to work on the build server without importing the gpg keys from the trusted_keys.pub file and running with a hardcoded whitelist commit. Make the CI workflow use these arguments as it is supposed to in .github. The public keys that can be imported are specified as files in the ci/keys/ directory. The files that are locked down are specified in the .github workflow as a single source of truth. This requires some complicated parsing in the verification script as well as a dependency from the verification script to the workflow YAML. These are not ideal design choices however the alternative is to not have a single source of truth for the locked down files as the github workflow can not depend on an external file.

The MainActivity would then register the handler, and things would work because the service would send multiple events before sending the ListenerReady, giving time for the handler to be registered before the event is received. This commit changes that in order to avoid the race condition. Now the ServiceConnection constructor must receive a callback as a parameter, and this callback will be used when registering for the ListenerReady event. This allows the constructor to enforce that the handler for the event is configured before the request for registration is sent.",1

On 2019.9-beta1 that changed so that the information was handled by the Rust daemon, and some code was added to clear those shared preferences so that users that update from the old versions don't have any left over data. This commit removes that migration code, because it's been more than a year since that change has happened and none of those versions are supported anymore. A user that updates from one of the old versions before 2019.9-beta1 to a version from this commit onwards will have some extra data stored in shared preferences (which should be less than 1 KiB) that won't be ever used.

NM will just wipe the config for interfaces it doesn't have the config for in systemd-resolved, and since our daemon prefers systemd-resolved over NM, our config would be wiped. To fix this, I've changed the systemd-resolved DNS code to listen to changes to the global DNS config and reapply the tunnel interface DNS config if it's changed in any way. To better seperate the conecrns, the systemd-resolved DBus specific code was moved to the talpid-dbus crate, and the DNS code that manages the state and applies changes remains in talpid-core. One other solution that was considered was to just prefer NM over systemd-resolved, and we already kind of could do that, but the coming NM versions (1.28 and up) seem to not be able to manage DNS via it's own /etc/resolv.conf.",0

On most systems this file isn't present. By default Windows allows any authenticated users to create new files in the system roots, meaning that a user can created a directory structure C:\etc\ssl\ containing a file openssl.cnf. When present the file will be read and processed by the OpenSSL library (OpenVPN). A local attacker can abuse this situation by creating a configuration file containing a malicious engine entry pointing to an attacker-controlled DLL. When the configuration is processed, an attempt is made to load this DLL by the OpenVPN binary. Since OpenVPN is running as LocalSystem, it is possible for any authenticated user to run arbitrary code as LocalSystem. Adding the no-autoload-config to the OpenSSL build options disable loading this file on initialization. So I added this and re-built OpenVPN on all platforms.",0
