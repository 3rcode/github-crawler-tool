Merge branch 'ci-lockfiles-always-complained-about',0.31231308,Notarize release builds with Apple. Making them run without warning on 10.15 Catalina.,,0
Fix CI verification script,0.37786996,"Improve offline check so if it fails, it always fails as online.",The verification script running on github would complain that the first commit of a PR changed all of the locked down files if this commit was unsigned. The reason was that in our github enviornment we don't fetch the entire git history but instead only the needed commits (so called shallow repository). The entire history is therefore folded into the first commit in the shallow repo. Since this history contains modifications of locked down files and since this commit is not signed the script will think this commit modified files its not allowed to. This fix deepens the shallow repo by 1 after fetching. It also clarifies a print in verification script to be more descriptive.,0

Create verification script and github action,0.3506887,Add new settings page for generating and verifying wireguard keys.,"Create a script which verifies that a set of ""locked down"" files are not changed in commits that have not been signed. Create a github workflow that runs the script in the CI. The script accepts --whitelist  and --import-gpg-keys arguments. The default settings are supposed to work on the build server without importing the gpg keys from the trusted_keys.pub file and running with a hardcoded whitelist commit. Make the CI workflow use these arguments as it is supposed to in .github. The public keys that can be imported are specified as files in the ci/keys/ directory. The files that are locked down are specified in the .github workflow as a single source of truth. This requires some complicated parsing in the verification script as well as a dependency from the verification script to the workflow YAML. These are not ideal design choices however the alternative is to not have a single source of truth for the locked down files as the github workflow can not depend on an external file. The mullvad signing key is named to be first in the list in order to be imported first. The whitelisted commit is the latest master before this commit",0

To mitigate cases where the service has been too slow to reach the target state, for instance when the tile service starts the vpn service as foreground with the connect action, this change aims to always promote the service to foreground when connect/disconnect actions are provided.

Ensure ListenerReady handler is registered first,0.4331591,Wait for NetworkManager and systemd-resolved services to start before daemon starts on platforms,"Previously there could be a race condition because the ServiceConnection constructor would register itself as an event listener on the service without registering a handler for the ListenerReady event sent after the registration is complete. The MainActivity would then register the handler, and things would work because the service would send multiple events before sending the ListenerReady, giving time for the handler to be registered before the event is received. This commit changes that in order to avoid the race condition. Now the ServiceConnection constructor must receive a callback as a parameter, and this callback will be used when registering for the ListenerReady event. This allows the constructor to enforce that the handler for the event is configured before the request for registration is sent.",0

Remove old shared preferences clean-up code,0.45683485,Remove all settings when the app is uninstalled silently.,"On versions 2019.8-beta1 and older, the app stored the application version information as shared preferences. On 2019.9-beta1 that changed so that the information was handled by the Rust daemon, and some code was added to clear those shared preferences so that users that update from the old versions don't have any left over data. This commit removes that migration code, because it's been more than a year since that change has happened and none of those versions are supported anymore. A user that updates from one of the old versions before 2019.9-beta1 to a version from this commit onwards will have some extra data stored in shared preferences (which should be less than 1 KiB) that won't be ever used. The only way to remove that data is to manually clear the app storage, reinstall the app, or to upgrade to a version from 2020 before updating to future versions.",0

Watch DNS config changes in systemd-resolved,0.7535824,  systemd-resolved directly to manage DNS. ,"Certain NM versions will overwrite systemd-resovled config when they're reapplying existing config, this can be invoked nmcli general reload dns-full or by receiving a new DHCP lease. NM will just wipe the config for interfaces it doesn't have the config for in systemd-resolved, and since our daemon prefers systemd-resolved over NM, our config would be wiped. To fix this, I've changed the systemd-resolved DNS code to listen to changes to the global DNS config and reapply the tunnel interface DNS config if it's changed in any way. To better seperate the conecrns, the systemd-resolved DBus specific code was moved to the talpid-dbus crate, and the DNS code that manages the state and applies changes remains in talpid-core. One other solution that was considered was to just prefer NM over systemd-resolved, and we already kind of could do that, but the coming NM versions (1.28 and up) seem to not be able to manage DNS via it's own /etc/resolv.conf.",1
