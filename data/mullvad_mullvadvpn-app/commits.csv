2520,Promote service to fg when actions provided,"As of Android 8 (API level 26), the system has a strict timer where the service must run startForeground within seconds after being started as foreground (startForegroundService). To mitigate cases where the service has been too slow to reach the target state, for instance when the tile service starts the vpn service as foreground with the connect action, this change aims to always promote the service to foreground when connect/disconnect actions are provided. This solution relies on the service demoting itself to from foreground in cases where it shouldn't run as foreground.",Promote service to fg when actions provided,"As of Android 8 (API level 26), the system has a strict timer where the service must run startForeground within seconds after being started as foreground (startForegroundService).

5464,Ensure ListenerReady handler is registered first,"Previously there could be a race condition because the ServiceConnection constructor would register itself as an event listener on the service without registering a handler for the ListenerReady event sent after the registration is complete. The MainActivity would then register the handler, and things would work because the service would send multiple events before sending the ListenerReady, giving time for the handler to be registered before the event is received. This commit changes that in order to avoid the race condition. Now the ServiceConnection constructor must receive a callback as a parameter, and this callback will be used when registering for the ListenerReady event. This allows the constructor to enforce that the handler for the event is configured before the request for registration is sent.",Ensure ListenerReady handler is registered first,"Previously there could be a race condition because the ServiceConnection constructor would register itself as an event listener on the service without registering a handler for the ListenerReady event sent after the registration is complete.

NM will just wipe the config for interfaces it doesn't have the config for in systemd-resolved, and since our daemon prefers systemd-resolved over NM, our config would be wiped. To fix this, I've changed the systemd-resolved DNS code to listen to changes to the global DNS config and reapply the tunnel interface DNS config if it's changed in any way. To better seperate the conecrns, the systemd-resolved DBus specific code was moved to the talpid-dbus crate, and the DNS code that manages the state and applies changes remains in talpid-core. One other solution that was considered was to just prefer NM over systemd-resolved, and we already kind of could do that, but the coming NM versions (1.28 and up) seem to not be able to manage DNS via it's own /etc/resolv.conf.",Watch DNS config changes in systemd-resolved,"Certain NM versions will overwrite systemd-resovled config when they're reapplying existing config, this can be invoked nmcli general reload dns-full or by receiving a new DHCP lease.
