41,Fix CI verification script,The verification script running on github would complain that the first commit of a PR changed all of the locked down files if this commit was unsigned. The reason was that in our github enviornment we don't fetch the entire git history but instead only the needed commits (so called shallow repository). The entire history is therefore folded into the first commit in the shallow repo. Since this history contains modifications of locked down files and since this commit is not signed the script will think this commit modified files its not allowed to. This fix deepens the shallow repo by 1 after fetching. It also clarifies a print in verification script to be more descriptive.,Fix CI verification script,The verification script running on github would complain that the first commit of a PR changed all of the locked down files if this commit was unsigned.

5680,Ensure ListenerReady handler is registered first,"Previously there could be a race condition because the ServiceConnection constructor would register itself as an event listener on the service without registering a handler for the ListenerReady event sent after the registration is complete. The MainActivity would then register the handler, and things would work because the service would send multiple events before sending the ListenerReady, giving time for the handler to be registered before the event is received. This commit changes that in order to avoid the race condition. Now the ServiceConnection constructor must receive a callback as a parameter, and this callback will be used when registering for the ListenerReady event. This allows the constructor to enforce that the handler for the event is configured before the request for registration is sent.",Ensure ListenerReady handler is registered first,"Previously there could be a race condition because the ServiceConnection constructor would register itself as an event listener on the service without registering a handler for the ListenerReady event sent after the registration is complete.

A user that updates from one of the old versions before 2019.9-beta1 to a version from this commit onwards will have some extra data stored in shared preferences (which should be less than 1 KiB) that won't be ever used.

NM will just wipe the config for interfaces it doesn't have the config for in systemd-resolved, and since our daemon prefers systemd-resolved over NM, our config would be wiped. To fix this, I've changed the systemd-resolved DNS code to listen to changes to the global DNS config and reapply the tunnel interface DNS config if it's changed in any way. To better seperate the conecrns, the systemd-resolved DBus specific code was moved to the talpid-dbus crate, and the DNS code that manages the state and applies changes remains in talpid-core. One other solution that was considered was to just prefer NM over systemd-resolved, and we already kind of could do that, but the coming NM versions (1.28 and up) seem to not be able to manage DNS via it's own /etc/resolv.conf.",Watch DNS config changes in systemd-resolved,"Certain NM versions will overwrite systemd-resovled config when they're reapplying existing config, this can be invoked nmcli general reload dns-full or by receiving a new DHCP lease.
