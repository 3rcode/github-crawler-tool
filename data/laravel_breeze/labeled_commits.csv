The reason is Attribute Inheritance on Multiple Root Nodes Inertia shares errors as a prop by default and Breeze shares auth as a prop by default. If those props are not explicitly defined on each page component a Vue runtime warning will be issued. We can wrap all the root nodes of the page component in a <div> to create a single root component and get rid of the warning, But those props will be inherited as Non-Prop Attributes resulting in <div errors=""[object Object]"" auth=""[object Object]""> Suggested solution : explicitly define errors and auth as props on each page component.",1
