Fix EmailVerificationTest to pass using Uuids (#85),1.0000001,Fix EmailVerificationTest to pass using Uuids (#85)﻿,"Most of the solutions to use UUIDs as primary key for models relies on Eloquent events. The Breeze email verification's test fakes the Event bus before a fake user is created, so if you're going to use an event based solution for generating uuid it will fail while trying to create the user (integrity constraint on SQL). The solution should be quite easy: creating the user before start faking the event bus.",1

The reason is Attribute Inheritance on Multiple Root Nodes Inertia shares errors as a prop by default and Breeze shares auth as a prop by default. If those props are not explicitly defined on each page component a Vue runtime warning will be issued. We can wrap all the root nodes of the page component in a  to create a single root component and get rid of the warning, But those props will be inherited as Non-Prop Attributes resulting in  Suggested solution : explicitly define errors and auth as props on each page component.",1
