1502 deadlock in slideshow fix,0.32947147,Avoid a crash when importing videos,"This eliminates a deadlock in BackgroundJob and moves the next/previous controls into SinglePhotoPage along with the hacky fix we have for when the user holds down the next/prev key. This does uncover two more issues, which I've filed tickets for. 1. The hacky fix is entirely time-dependent. On a slow enough computer it won't work. Ticket #3892 2. Slideshow transitions shouldn't be occurring when I use next/prev. It should just jump to the next photo asap. Ticket #3891",0
