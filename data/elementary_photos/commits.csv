267,Update vapi files (#650),Copied in the changes from the Shotwell vapi files and fixed up and tested the associated vala. All of these code changes relate to importing and previewing files from a camera which I've just tested still works with my Pixel 4a. I also changed how the image-missing icon is loaded in the import page as this was not working and causing criticals in the terminal. This should get us some memory leak fixes as we've now got rid of a lot of the manual memory management that wasn't done right anyway.

Vala was unfortunately initializing the lock only when the first instance of the class was created, which could be when one or more threads had already acquired and were waiting on the lock.  So these threads never continued execution after the lock was freed.  I solved the problem by eliminating the lock in these and similar classes.  We now call a static init() method earlier instead."

3649,"Closes #4099. The application now reaps orphaned tags automatically, ",preventing them from crashing via the sidebar tree-graft assertion.
3650,Crash fixed when undoing tag merge: #4129,"When undoing a complex series of tag merges and moves, Shotwell would regularly crash.  The reparent tag command was holding on to Tag objects during its lifetime.  Proxies would be better, but this is problematic because we can't use a proxy as a map key.  This patch uses the tag's path (as a string) instead of a ref to the Tag itself."
3651,Soft assertions during F-Spot import of duplicates: #4126,I believe this could happen any time duplicates were detected during import.  This might solve other bugs where import is not reporting the right results.
3652,Problems with Samsung NV10: #4117,"Photos taken with Samsung NV10 have improper EXIF date/time format.  This patch allows for Shotwell to interpret them.  The reporter also had trouble with video creation time.  This doesn't appear to be an issue with Shotwell, as the dates were corrupted in the file. However, they exposed an overflow bug, which this patch corrects as well."

3661,Double-clicking an event in the Events or a Year directory now moves cursor: #4114,"If the event being jumped to wasn't visible in the sidebar tree, the cursor would not move when jumping to a particular event.

3668,Exclude installation of gsettings-data-convert file: #4102,"A configure option now allows the user to avoid installing the gsettings-data-convert file (shotwell.convert).  This is useful because the file must be installed in /usr/share/GConf/gsettings (and not /usr/local) for the program to locate it, which is a problem for folks who want to install as a user and not root. Also cleaned up the configure script help, which was still reflecting options no longer available."
3669,"Re-closes 4061, removed the 'cannot import raw+jpeg from filesystem' blurb.",
3670,No longer need to install or compile GConf schemas.  Courtesy Vincent Untz.,

This may fix #4072, but I can't reproduce it on my machine to start with.  This commit may also close #4056, but more investigation is required."
3690,Undoing parent tag remove now properly undoable: #4047,"Problem was that when a photo was detached from a Tag, that might result in numerous detaches from other Tags (namely, children of the parent being removed).  These need to be stored (and proxied) in the TagUntagCommand. Note that I also noticed some proxy problems in DeleteTag, and I've made some changes there as well."

3754,Click-in-region to edit Faces is broken under Unity: #3896,This works around a Unity bug where the leave_notify_event is fired when the mouse pointer is still over the region.  The work around is to verify the mouse has indeed left the window before processing.  Courtesy Valentin Barros.
3755,Generated new POT files for the upcoming Shotwell 0.11 release.,"These POT files are versioned ""Shotwell-0.10.90+trunk,"" indicating their anticipation of the Shotwell 0.11 release. The version number in the Makefile has also been updated to Shotwell-0.10.90+trunk."

3764,Implements faces/people management in Shotwell. Closes #3894. Many THANKS to our GSoC student Valentin Barros!,
3765,1502 deadlock in slideshow fix,"This eliminates a deadlock in BackgroundJob and moves the next/previous controls into SinglePhotoPage along with the hacky fix we have for when the user holds down the next/prev key. This does uncover two more issues, which I've filed tickets for. 1. The hacky fix is entirely time-dependent. On a slow enough computer it won't work. Ticket #3892 2. Slideshow transitions shouldn't be occurring when I use next/prev. It should just jump to the next photo asap. Ticket #3891"

3772,3837 delete mimics on upgrade,Adds a new Upgrades system
3773,3842 orientation fixes for direct mode,"Fixes not one but TWO cases where photos appear rotated in direct mode. One is a simple ""stomping on values"" problem, the other is a more subtle race condition that only appears if you click fast enough when Shotwell loads."
3774,3427 timezone correction for import folder,
3775,3836 Show original now works with RAW,"Previously, the Shotwell developed photo would always be shown when pressing shift in single photo mode.  Now it will display the selected development."
3776,3838 Default RAW developer preference.,Newly imported RAW photos are set to the developer set in the preferences dialog.
3777,Adds protection against GDK errors by forcing the crop region's boundaries to be inside the image's boundaries.,"(The crop box has to move when an image is straightened, and, under pathological  circumstances, one or more corners could end up outside the pixbuf; this forces the sub- pixbuf region we get after cropping to be fully within the image.)"
3778,Closes 3840 by adding a range check to stop us from writing outside the pixel array.,
3779,3663 Simplified tag and search sidebar context menues,"This simplifies the sidebar context menus for saved searches and tags.  But it does oh-so-much-more!  It also removes a few translated strings that were not being used, and flips the order of the two options in the tag sidebar context menu so that Rename is before Delete to be more consistent with other parts of Shotwell."
3780,adding valencia prefs to gitignore,
3781,3730 selectable RAW developer,"This adds the ability to switch between Shotwell developed RAW images and camera developed RAW images. It will automatically group newly imported RAW+JPEG pairs, using the JPEG as the camera developed image when available."

3784,3755 crash while deleting last photo in fullscreen mode,
3785,3743 crash on startup when two events have the same name,
3786,3637 fixes assertion in fullscreen mode when pressing enter,"This takes care of an assertion in full screen mode.  All you have to do to hit this is go to full screen, hit Enter and then change to another photo (left, right, etc.) Why did this happen?  Well the LibraryPhotoPage interprets ""Escape"" and ""Enter"" as going back to the collection.  FullscreenWindow overrides Escape to mean leaving the full screen view; but it didn't handle Enter.  So what you were left with is a full screen view of your photo with no LibraryPhotoPage underneath."

3800,3672 fixed opening raw photos in direct mode,"The format needs to be detected upfront; delaying this had unforseen consequences.  Since there's no other place in Shotwell where a format could change after import, it makes sense just to do it in the pre-pre-import step for direct mode."

4489,"2532: If Shotwell can't create vital data files/directories at startup, instead of logging an error and exiting, it displays a dialog box error and exits.  NOTE: This introduces new translatable strings that are not the .pot file.  Although past string freeze, we feel these are very rare cases and won't be seen by 99.9% of users, but should be visible to that one-tenth of a percent that have done something really odd with their permissions.",
4490,Fixes sidebar color when running under dark themes. Closes #2483.,

Then the offline files were searched to see if they were online individually, which they all were, and so they were marked online.  This solves the problem by following symbolic links only in the directory scan.  More thorough symbolic link support needs to happen.",

This commit provides support for file import (but not from camera),","JPEG mimicking (to prevent full-sized RAW decodes and processing whenever possible), and a file format  abstraction layer in anticipation of PNG and TIFF support. Some RAW files do not display correctly; some have odd dimensions, other have color problems.  I'm investigating  these currently.  Also, to improve import time, instead of displaying a full-window pixbuf of each photo as it's  loaded, the largest thumbnail is displayed instead.

5056,1525: Improved log message displayed when creating database.,
5057,1539: The reason the photos triggered a false positive in the dupe detection code is that they have no,"thumbnail but the exact same EXIF.  Now dupe detection requires that both EXIF and the thumbnail are present,  otherwise a full content comparision will be performed."
5058,1519: segault on import solved.  Problem relates to #1520 (also closed in this commit).  Completion callback,"was being re-entered due to the thumbnail import code calling spin_event_loop() (which is a legacy aspect of the  old-style import, which was serialized in the main event thread).  Additionally, the BatchImport object was  being derefed and freed because the Workers/BackgroundJob system does not maintain a reference to the object  with the callbacks; this has been remedied."

5253,1203: Photo caused crash on import due to rounding.  The photo is so wide and short its height was being scaled,"to zero.  Now, all scaled dimensions are returned floored at least to one in both dimensions.

5267,"1176: More event generation issues, this time when photos all are in the morning before the event boundary",(4AM).  #1174/#1181: We're now more aggressive searching the JPEG file for EXIF.  This solves the problem of  some photos (either from GIMP or from certain cameras) not being recognized as having EXIF in them.
5268,removes publishing menu item on windows build.,
5269,1165: Shotwell no longer aborts when import runs out of disk space.  The import will halt and the user will be,"presented an error dialog.  Also, fixed Events so small thumbnails are enlarged to fit the square, guaranteeing  all are the same size in the checkerboard display."

5280,Fixed capitalization in the Extended Information window.,
5281,Fixes a problem with generating too many events when photos are on the same day.,
5282,1145/#1146: These were caused by the programmatic switching of pages.  Some of the other controls (in this,"case, the Gtk.TreeView) allow for events to be processed in their own handlers, and causing an expose_event to  be called before Page.switched_to() was invoked.  This is safe, but an assertion was in place to check for pages  being seen when they weren't supposed to.  Since this can happen during a switch, removing this assertion."
5283,Added new pin-toolbar icon.,
5284,973: Display corruption when dragging below the last photo in GTK+ 2.18.  There appears to be a change in how,Gtk.Adjustment values are clamped between 2.16 and 2.18.  This patch enforces the limit.

5311,873: Import and directory reads were slowing down moving between photos in direct-edit mode.  Import is much,faster now (and faster for library mode as well!) and the directory is only read once.  Will need to later  monitor the directory for file additions/removals.  #1106: Modified asterisk now working.  Also fixed other  little bit rots in direct-edit mode that had gone undetected.

5332,"1069: Pages are now destroyed when removed from LibraryWindow, and each Page destroys all the widgets it","creates that are not contained/parented when the Page is destroyed (i.e. the menu bar).

5390,1002: Loosened up the assertion that checks the pixbuf's dimensions in the pipeline.  Pixel-accuracy is too,much to ask here when considering all the subsystems involved.  Now the assertions just check that the pixbuf's  dimensions are in the ballpark.

5419,Merge from shotwell-0.3.0 branch.,
5420,," Factored out directory-related methods from AppWindow into a new class AppDirs.   On Windows, prepend the directory containing the Shotwell executable to the PATH on startup.  This is necessary so that gconfd can find its DLLs, which live in the Shotwell executable directory. "
5421,This fixes a bug Allison discovered in trunk.  Migrating it to 0.3.0.,
5422,"956: Need to re-hide progress bar after pages are added to the notebook, as this requires a show_all() on it,",which shows all hidden widgets.  This fixes the problem by hiding the progress_bar when necessary when the page  is switched to.
5423,"962: The full-window page was holding a ref to the Photo object after it had been deleted, triggering the",assertion.  This change ensures the ref is dropped when a photo is deleted.
5424,957: A function used within the Photo pipeline needed to be performed atomically and was not.  This fixes that,problem and cleans up atomicity elsewhere in the pipeline.
5425,Added an Inno Setup script which can generate a Windows installer.,
5426,961: Fixed.  A long-running problem was that SinglePhotoPage resized the DrawingArea widget to match the,"viewport.  This was unnecessary (GtkViewport does this automatically) and, with certain scrollbar policies,  would cause the described problem."
5427,Changed the event signalling mode of the adjustment palette sliders from Discontinuous to Delayed.,
5428,995: Ellipses fixed when unmounting camera.  #958: Double-clicking slider and moving it is a feature of GTK.,Changed code to fix crash due to reference counting/signal disconnect issues.

5431,Added code so that we can find the directory where Shotwell is installed on either Linux or Windows.,
5432,Fixed a bug where a month event page was triggering an assertion when accessed immediately after it was created ,"by an import.  This was due to Gtk.Notebook.show_all() not being called after the page was added to the notebook  (which is a no-no).  This fixes it, and hopefully ensures it's always called when a page is added."
5433,Use GConf on Windows.,
5434,Use /bin/bash to execute configure.  This avoids a shell portability problem since,different versions of /bin/sh may echo newlines differently.
5435,728: Drag selection now works properly at the bottom of a large collection.  Related to a signed 16-bit,"overflow bug when GDK window grab is enabled (reported at https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=599937). Also, we discovered that signals must be disconnected manually, so have done that as well in places where  required."
5436,"Removed periods after ""cm"" abbreviation in crop tool aspect ratio popup box. This change resolves ticket #941.",
5437,"711: No full fixes for this, as it's been decided this is a Gtk issue.  However, did remove the scrollbars","flashing as the window is shrunk by the user, which helps.

5439,Enabled building on a Mac via GTK-OSX.,
5440,874: Increased event lull duration (event gap threshold) to 4 hours.,

5443,899: Fixed crash on import due to faulty EXIF data.  Also fixed a bug due to recent readahead commit.,
5444,"This prevents readahead in the direct edit case, which only slows it down (due to importing on the fly).  Will ",need to be revisited at a future point.
5445,741: Now performing readaheads in full-window and fullscreen view with a cache filled by background threads.,Also fixed some issues exposed by these readaheads in direct edit mode and fullscreen mode.
5446,Added PNG icons for Windows port.,
5447,Various changes to allow Shotwell to build on Windows.,(The new .png files will arrive in a separate commit since I have them on a different machine.)

5452,allows for sidebar navigation with keyboard,
5453,893 exposed a bug in the import code where a file that was not copied into the library directory (typically,"~/Pictures) because it was located inside the user photos directory was deleted if the import failed.  Shotwell  was deleting the file if it was supposed to be copied but wasn't.  Now, it only deletes if file was actually  copied."
5454,534: User now asked at end of import if they want to delete the photos on the camera.,
5455,"Resolves bug #891 (""Image does not grow/shrink with window when red-eye is activated, and may crash"").",
5456,I failed to add a vapi patch and binary icon file in the previous commit; this commit adds these overlooked files.,
5457,Completes implementation of feature #199 (Crop aspect ratios).,
5458,"fixes for tickets 622 (tool placement in fullscreen), 835 (pixelated fullscreen image), 878 (titles persist between event pages), 666 (basic info pane padded), and 875 autoenhance shortcut)",
5459,535: Duplicates now detected on import and reported in summary to user.  This patch will check camera photos,"for duplicates via their EXIF/thumbnail hashes as well drag-and-drop files, either by EXIF/thumbnail (if  available) or by a full-file hash."
5460,"With libgphoto 2.4.6, EXIF data is garbage from the camera, so cannot accurately count how many preview bytes ",have to be downloaded when updating the progress bar.  Now merely reflecting the number of loaded photos  in the progress bar.
5461,888: This is due to the code rework for #887 and a bug in libgphoto2 2.4.6 where garbage is returned,when querying for EXIF data on a camera photo.  This fixes the problem by querying for the EXIF and the  thumbnail separately.
5462,"implements shift+arrow selection (393), the sidebar selection fix (877), and changes the unmount diaglog (883)",
5463,536: Toggle button on import page allows user to hide photos that have already been imported.,
5464,"changed all instances of name to title, titles default to off",
5465,fixes export dialog pango errors,
5466,shift+home and shift+end now work properly.,
5467,Fixes ampersand in event tooltip bug and corrects shift+click selection to be linear.,
5468,866: Updated to work with libgee 0.5.0.  Deprecated calls now replaced with new methods.,
5469,865: Direct editing fixed.  Was not entirely integrated into the new architecture.,
5470,Added David Jeske to THANKS file.,
5471,"612: (Jeske) Escape cancels current tool, then returns to collection page.  Removed ""Return to Photos"" from",View menu.
5472,658: (Jeske) F11 and Esc now exit fullscreen mode.,
5473,"These changes make it so Shotwell starts with only the most recent event branch open, opens the tree containing an event when the event is selected, scrolls appropriately to a newly selected event in the sidebar, and maintains the expanded/collapsed state of the sidebar tree when resorting events.",
5474,859: Reflow was not occuring after import.  This fell out of some of the recent optimizations (but is fixed,thanks to recent erchitecture change!)
5475,Fixed an issue where a reflow() wasn't being called when the new EventPage was realized on the screen.  This bug ,popped up in Allison's work on heirarchical events.
5476,842: Fixed.  #742: Fixed.  #710: Fixed.  Empty space shown on quick drag if thumbnail not in cache.  Good,enough for now.  #709: Usable but could be better.  Good enough for now.
5477,Added date hierarchy to event directory.,
5478,Added Allison to AUTHORS list.,
5479,"More work on improving UI responsiveness.  In particular, CheckerboardLayout now maintains a spatial ",(two-dimensional) data structure to allow for quicker traversal of its laid-out items.  This speeds up finding  items at pixel coordinates and intersections of area and items (which in turn is a boost in expose_event() and  update_visible_page()).
5480,"710: Now using threads to load thumbnails in the background.  More work to be done to close ticket, but with","blocking I/O now in the background, the UI controls are much more responsive."
5481,"Improves auto-enhance performance by about 25%, closes #674.",
5482,Closes ticket #818 (internationalize .desktop files),
5483,Now require Vala 0.7.7 to compile.,
5484,"710: Some work done to improve performance of scrollbar (with large libraries).  Specifically, this introduces",the difference for a ThumbnailView to have a view_altered (which requires a repaint) and a geometry_altered  (which requires a reflow in the layout).
5485,"Fixes problems caused by missing photo files in slideshow.  Regresses on manual advance so that no low res image put up immediately, but that should be fixed with readahead.",
5486,"824: Fixes for 0.7.7, binding updates and compiler/syntax changes.",
5487,809: Final step of model/view refactoring.  Data objects and their collections are now maintained in the,"classes in DataObject.vala and DataCollection.vala.  All other objects throughout the system can now access  photos and events in a unified way, and keep their own state synchronized consistently."
5488,no longer crashes when photo file source is missing,
5489,"This revision implements full international support (enhancement #625) in the codebase and build system, including installation of translation files during make install. Enhancement #625 is now closed.",
5490,"809: Part two of the model/view refactoring.  Photo is now integrated into the new architecture, now breaking","the other half of the Queryable system for Basic Properties.  After some consideration, didn't want to fold  these changes in with the next (which integrates Page with the new architecture) because that represents another  large change, and the two together will be unwieldy.  However, the next commit will restore Basic Properties."
5491,This revision includes fully internationalized program code. Internationalization support in the build process and packaging are not yet complete.,
5492,809: This is part one of the model/view refactoring.  This adds the new DataObject and DataCollection classes,which are the basis of all data objects in the system that need to be organized.  Event and EventSource were  refactored as part of this first pass.  Note that the properties sheet is broken when displaying events because  the refactoring is not complete.  The next commit (or perhaps the one after that) will fix this when Page and  its children are integrated with DataObject/DataCollection.
5493,"Fixes an assertion bug in direct edit mode.  Also, direct edit now takes advantage of some scaling optimizations ",recently made available.
5494,"Implemented basic event rename, using a dialog.",
5495,Regression: This speeds up the time it takes to display the Events Directory.,
5496,257: Removed 64-pixel thumbnails.  Do not think at this time we need to have screen-sized thumbnails.  #621,"and #677: Applying color transformations is much speedier.  Pipeline only runs once, to generate thumbnails, and  thumbnails are now generated in the idle queue."
5497,"Added the Event class, which is akin to the Photo (now LibraryPhoto) class.  All event-related logic outside of ",database queries belongs here.
5498,"Fixes a couple of scaling bugs exposed with the recent changes to load-and-decode.  Also, tweaks and bug-fixes ",in the thumbnail caching.
5499,"This is all work toward #677, attempting to avoid running the pipeline when doing edit operations.  Because the ","pipeline must be run for generating thumbnails, that run is not avoided with this check-in.  (This may be  addressed with background threads.)  This check-in avoids the pipeline when possible with current architecture,  and attempts to reuse an old pixbuf if the user cancels the edit tool."
5500,Fixed scaled load-and-decode to properly scale images which are re-oriented and/or have a crop.  Assertions in ,the code guarantee that the pixbuf should not be rescaled once it leaves the pipeline.
5501,"Auto-enhance sets the Shadows slider in this revision, completing implementation of enhancement #641.",
5502,Now using a scaled load-and-decode in the pipeline.  Full-window images are no longer requested at screen size ,"and then scaled to fit the window, but rather requested at window (actually, viewport) size.  Window resizing is  done with current pixbuf until the resize completes and the pipeline is re-run."
5503,Resolves bug #756.,
5504,"Adds a Shadows slider to the Adjustments palette, closing enhancement request #640.",
5505,701: Changed translucency from 75% to 90%.,
5506,"Optimizations to speed up the photo viewer, including using bilinear rather than hyper interpolation for images ",going to the screen.
5507,Resolves #738. Fixes a bug whereby the position of the exposure slider wasn't set properly when the Adjustments palette was opened. Increases image update performance when sliders are re-positioned in the Adjustments palette.,
5508,Added remove_transformation to Photo for set_adjustment().,
5509,737: Fixes enhancement being run twice when activated while another tool is open.,
5510,Fixed a minor bug introduced in the previous revision whereby the histogram graphic in the adjustment palette failed to update in response to movement of the exposure slider.,
5511,Color adjustment and enhancement are condensed into one operation in this revision (#678). This change was effected through a major refactoring of the color transformation subsystem. This refactoring provides other performance gains throughout the color transformation subsystem.,
5512,Bug: Need a TransformablePhoto.has_transformation() to deal with a null transformations map.,
5513,Added settings toolbar button in slideshow page.  Settings dialog allows user ,to modify the delay (in seconds) between slideshow frames.  The slideshow delay and display basic info menu option now persist between sessions.
5514,Refactoring of the drag-select code into CollectionLayout.  This is to push drawing code out of ,"CheckerboardPage, which holds the selection list.  This is part of the refactoring for collections."
5515,Widgetless thumbnail implementation.  This commit assists with #136.  Also added aggregate debug logging to ,"ThumbnailCache, as its log messages interfered with performance testing.  CameraTable initializes after a delay  to shave even more time off the app startup time."
5516,Nub icon not added to last commit.,
5517,Adjustment palette now includes histogram slider controls (#615) that are automatically set by auto-enhance (#681).,
5518,"All PhotoTable rows are not stored in memory, to speed up startup.  Database verification is looser now, as all ",photos are not verified at initialization.
5519,EventPages now loaded on-demand rather than created all at once.  A similar strategy can be used with albums.,
5520,As part of #136: CollectionPage was iterating its parent's list to ensure the same photo was not added twice to ,its view.  Smart!  CollectionPage now maintains a HashMap of LibraryPhoto -> Thumbnail.
5521,the basic properties display now updates with multiple selection.,
5522,Detected a bug when testing iPhone 3.0 with Rob's: the unmount failed and the unmount progress bar remained ,visible and the camera remained marked as busy.  This fixes that problem.  Have not been able to reproduce the  unmount problem.
5523,"670: When Shotwell first starts, it runs a verify_database() function.  This now looks for events with no",end_time set (due to #665) and sets it to the exposure_time of the newest photo in the event.
5524,Gah ... corner-case in last commit.  This solves it.,
5525,669: F11 now works as it should in the Events Directory page.  Also cleaned up SinglePhotoPage to be more,efficient about only creating a new pixmap when it's absolutely required.
5526,533: Holding down the arrow key doesn't hang Shotwell any longer.  #63: Quick compare holding down the Shift,key of a modified photo (works both in library and direct-edit mode).  #537: Slideshow now begins with selected  photo.  #665: Last event now marked with its end time.  #668: Toolbar now remains in-place in fullscreen mode  when using compiz.
5527,Fixed graying out Revert menu item in context menu.,
5528,"Fixes various problems in direct-edit identified by Adam, including Save/Save As behavior and dialog titles, ","displaying a dirty asterisk and path in the title bar (a la gedit), and handling cases where a file is  unreadable or undecodable."
5529,added display basic photo info feature for single selection,
5530,Regression in the refactoring for direct-edit mode; thumbnails were being re-oriented twice when the user ,rotated an image.  (Caught by Allison.)
5531,652: Shotwell will now register itself as a JPEG viewer when installed.  Fixed About box.,
5532,Edit/Undo -> Photo/Revert to Original.  A better solution in the future is for EditingHostPage to have its own ,PhotoMenu and PhotoContextMenu that is shared by the subclasses.
5533,647: Context menu added to direct editing page.  Queries before losing changes to photo.  Fixed thumbing,through directory.
5534,Added Lucas to AUTHORS file.,
5535,Added Save and Save As ... to direct editing window.  Moved more functionality from LibraryPhoto into ,TransformablePhoto.  Thumbing through directory now operational.
5536,"implements one-touch, toggle-able auto-enhance functionality; resolves ticket #62",
5537,Fixed mechanics of replacing photo object displayed in full-screen view.,
5538,First stab at direct photo editing (#187); can open a single file and edit it with our tool set.  Fullscreen ,mode supported.  No save feature or directory traversal yet.
5539,397: Fixed crop tool buttons for GNOME HIG.,
5540,"Broke PhotoPage into EditingHostPage and LibraryPhotoPage, in preparation for direct editing.  Also introduced ","PhotoCollection, a grouping interface for EditingHostPage to generically move through a group of photos."
5541,"Moved PhotoTransformer into TransformablePhoto, which is now properly in the inheritance tree.  Also prepped ","PhotoPage for using TransformablePhoto rather than Photo (which is now LibraryPhoto), so it can be reused for  direct edit mode."
5542,Exeption enum was accepted as int for get_pixbuf() parameter ... caused adjust tool to display psychadelic ,image.
5543,"Callers to PhotoTransformer.get_pixbuf now must specify a scale, to discourage pipeline transformations of ","unscaled pixbufs.  Support added for retrieving pixbufs at screen size, which is adequate for most display  operations.  Beefed-up the get_preview_pixbuf() method, which encourages using lower-quality but  fully-transformed pixbufs when possible."
5544,restructured queryable interfaces to return static types,
5545,Part two of staged commit to refactor for #189: new PhotoTransformer class deals with transformations without ,knowledge of how they're backed.
5546,Refactoring in preparation of direct-edit window (#187): AppWindow now broken into AppWindow & LibraryWindow.,
5547,Added Allison to THANKS file.,
5548,"Adds the Queryable class and classes for boxing stucts, changes Photo's","query_filesize to get_filesize, and moves set/get_dimensions to Exif from PhotoExif."
5549,In preparation for 0.2.0.,
5550,600: Now using user-defined pictures directory for default library storage.,
5551,Closes ticket #77. A dynamically-updating image histogram is now displayed in the Adjustment palette.,
5552,"372: Import DND modifier keys.  Note that Move is not implemented, for reasons I detail in #603.",
5553,Added instrumentation to Photo pixbuf pipeline to measure absolute time of each stage.  Also added feature to ,"allow caller to declare a scale for the pixbuf; Photo can perform the scale at an opportune time and reduce  overhead in certain operations.  Also fixed bug where the Thumbnail objects in the entire system were being  resized when the slider moved; now, only those that are in view are resized, and the others resize when they  come into view."
5554,"380: X server corruption when selecting with compositing WM fixed.  Different technique used, which should actually be faster and results in nicer presentation.",
5555,Support for Vala 0.7.5.,
5556,Doc changes in preparation for 0.1.2.,
5557,Previous version segfaults on 64-bit builds.  Issue is a bad binding for KeyFile; see ,http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=588104  KeyFile is only used in the database in PhotoTable.  It  appears the adjustment code (when compiled for release) exposed the binding problem.  Now using a custom vapi  until the binding is fixed.
5558,Not quite ... had to update toolbar controls as well.,
5559,504: Arrow keys move quicker through slideshow by using a 360 thumbnail for initial display.  #581: FP compiler,optimizations now included in release build.
5560,"506: Sped up opening photos by using large thumbnail is initial image.  #580: ""Copy files to library"" option",now available in File / Import.
5561,resolved bug #591 : assertion fails when null color adjustment (i.e. all sliders set to zero) is applied,
5562,"78: added adjust control manipulating exposure, saturation, temperature and tint",
5563,439: Resorting photos with large collection does not take so much time.  This one has been bugging me for a,"long time.  I replaced SortedList's inane insertion sort with a less-inane binary insertion sort.  Photo now  caches exposure_time to speed up comparisons, as going out to the database every time was too expensive.  Both  changes result in a marked improvement for the user.  Also made Sort By Exposure Time / Descending the default,  as that's more interesting for the user.  Also spotted a subtle bug in fullscreen window; fixed."
5564,464: Makefile no longer broken for incremental builds (hard-tab empty command fix).  #451: --debug | --release,in ./configure.  #452: Release build is default (-g -O2).
5565,441: Ubuntu packaging.  #460: Cross-compilation under Launchpad.  #461: Man page.  #462: Debian menu file.,"530: Tarball provides top-level directory.  #538: configure.in -> configure.mk  #544: Proper ""make distclean"". 554: Makefile builds .tar.gz.  #572: Only require libgee 0.1.3."
5566,"Resolved bugs #547 (""Crop reticle leaves artifacts in gutter"") and #548 (""Crop reticle can't be gripped if dropped in gutter"")",
5567,fixed bugs #551 and #552: import/export menus now have ellipses and dialog titles now match command names,
5568,fixed bugs #551 and #552: import/export menus now have ellipses and dialog titles now match command names,
5569,added enhancement #527: import from file menu option,
5570,Implemented red-eye removal feature.,
5571,Need to check for null with exif.,
5572,"fixed bug #588: delete photos confirmation now uses Cancel and Delete, buttons.  changed dialog icon to Warning and edited dialog message",
5573,fix bug that last checkin caused--added 1900 to date,
5574,fixed bug #502: extra space in event dates,
5575,Imported photos are sorted by exposure time as they're imported.,
5576,Crop code refactored into its own class of abstract type.  This allows PhotoPage to host more tools in the future via an abstract interface.  #456: THANKS file added.,
5577,426: Parallel builds now supported.,
5578,"Fixes importing from mass storage devices, especially card readers.",
5579,Brighten thumbnails on mouse-over.,
5580,437: Select All in camera import view.,
5581,435: Sidebar refactored into own class.  This will pay dividends later when more features come on line that incorporate more pages and more sidebar requirements.,
5582,433: Slideshow now paints high-quality without stepping up the improvement.,
5583,"205: Sort events by date, reflected in sidebar and in the events directory page.",
5584,"Upping version number to 0.1.2, for next release.",
5585,305: Base slideshow functionality.,
5586,Made changes for Shotwell to depend on gee-1.0 alone and not vala-1.0 (save to compile).,
5587,"Fixes compile errors with valac 0.7.4.  Explicitly checks for vala 0.7.3 or above in Makefile for building, ",separating the check from packages Shotwell depends on at runtime.
5588,"An attempt to fix #380, although still reported in the wild.  This, however, fixes a serious problem in how the ",selection rubberband is painted.
5589,Fixed version number in COPYING file.,
5590,Various pre-release fixes.,
5591,Fixed bug where was not switching to Camera view when desktop indicated a new attached device.  Fixed stepper ,buttons on scrollbar to now work.
5592,Updated URLs,
5593,"386: Renamed Subversion directory to ""shotwell""",
5594,416: make dist now available.,
5595,"337: Added README, INSTALL, etc. files.  #378: More thorough About box.  #389: Icon licensing information added to AUTHORS.  #413: Copyright/licensing added to all source files.",
5596,392: Arrow keys now available in all checkerboard views (Events and Camera included).  #342: Shift+Click now selects all in smallest rectangle.,
5597,"289: Check dependency versions, using Intrepid as base build system.  Vala 0.7.3 required, however.",
5598,Improved installation: Application icon now installed.,
5599,Removed Gtk call that was 2.16 or above.  Changed .desktop file to not ,launch terminal window.
5600,396: Right-click on crop tool window no longer crashes.  #339: Data directory now ~/.shotwell.  #394: Arrow keys to move next/previous photo in full-window and fullscreen mode.,
5601,308: Icons for all current buttons.  #388: Help/Contents URL.,
5602,"348: Now darkening area outside of crop rectangle.  Lightening it didn't look right; this can be easily changed, however.",
5603,370: Photo file deleted when removed from library.  User confirms with dialog.,
5604,369: All imported files are now copied into the user's photo library.,
5605,Fixed up the About dialog a little bit.  Still more work to be done on it.,
5606,367: Help/Contents implemented.,
5607,377: Forgot to add .ui file.,
5608,314: Show photos in full-window view as they're imported.  #315: Stop Import button.  #312: Drag-and-drop file import looks and acts the same as camera import.,
5609,Refactoring to prep for import queue page.,
5610,313: Smooth import progress bar.,
5611,Fixed an edge case where the user exits the app during an import and import is not cancelled.,
5612,"183: Major improvements to importing infrastructure to accumulate errors, report them all at once to the user, and to import from camera on-the-fly rather than copying all photos to local FS then importing.",
5613,352: Crop tool window no longer steals focus.,
5614,96: App exit now quick no matter if closed with close button or File/Quit.,
5615,"338: ""Cameras"" row in sidebar only visible when cameras actually present.",
5616,"344: Use arrow keys to move between photos, as well as Home/End.  Enter will load single-selected photo in full-window view.",

5618,341: Zoom level shared between events and Photos view.,
5619,Error with package checking.,
5620,"Decided to keep selection banding code inside CheckerboardPage, so CollectionLayout can focus on layout.",
5621,193: Drag selection now available.,
5622,346: Context menu now available for multiple selected items.,
5623,347: All toolbar buttons now have tooltips.,
5624,"345: Home/End/PgUp/PgDn now available to move the viewport around.  Sidebar does not maintain focus to make this happen.  This may be revisited later, esp. for accessibility review.",
5625,Further file organization in preparation for the first tarball.,
5626,"340: Logging suppressed by default.  Set environment variable SHOTWELL_LOG to see all, SHOTWELL_DEBUG, SHOTWELL_MESSAGE, etc. to see by level.",
5627,350: Ok button is now default in Export Photo dialog.,
5628,342: Fixes assertion crash where item was not selected on mouse-up due to unimplemented modifier key.,
5629,Minor fix to crop tool and DnD.  Fixed regression with crop tool window placement.,
5630,"296: Now with configure script to set installation prefix.  Also, moved all .ui files into separate directory.  Shotwell determines whether to use local or installed resources files at runtime.",
5631,Fixed bug reported by Vadim Peretokin.,
5632,"Some cleaning up, esp. how groups of IDs are reported by the database objects.",
5633,151: Using square brackets rather than +/- for thumbnail zoom accelerators.,
5634,284: File/Export w/ scaling.,
5635,321: Cameras item in sidebar unselectable.,
5636,259: Database versioning.  Also some long-needed refactoring of database code.,
5637,Better image generation when exporting.  Cleaned up photo updates (performed when external image change is detected).,
5638,294: Off-white sidebar.  #88: Blue photo selection color.,
5639,"229: Basic export via drag-and-drop.  More work can be done on the generated JPEG (if it's not simply a copy of the file stored in the library, i.e. it's been modified).  #293: Darker background, although not configurable at this time.",
5640,"189: Bug in libgphoto2 + pausing between unmount and camera_init() solved problem.  #301: Vala 0.7.3 resolves.  #192:Not a dirty flag issue, but iPhone changing its mount point name every time it's locked.  Resolved.  #196:Imported photos now saved in heirarchical directories, and unique filenames are guaranteed.",
5641,292: Menu item capitalization fixed.  Now using Rotate Right/Left for menu labels.,
5642,282: Cancel in crop tool window doesn't remove the crop.  #283: Standard icons in crop tool window buttons.  #64: Revert to original.,
5643,Prettier crop tool.  Simplified some of the invalidation code.  Not going to mark #203 as done until more discussion.,
5644,Fixed issues with crop tool in fullscreen mode.  Added opacity to the fullscreen toolbar and sized it smaller.  Opacity only works with a compositing WM.  Currently there's some flicker which needs investigation.,
5645,"Crop toolbar window now follows window if moved or resized, unless the user explicitly moves it to a position on the screen.",
5646,Fixed an off-by-one error when rotating and derotating crop dimensions.,
5647,Fixed bug in sorting code.,
5648,"Major overhaul to improve responsiveness of editing photos and generating new thumbnails.  All modifications to the photo stored in the database are stored in the photo's original, unrotated coordinate system, which means they do not have to be adjusted whenever the image is rotated.  Some refactoring, including making Orientation a powerhouse of its own.",
5649,"Major improvement to performance when moving and resizing the crop tool.  For now, the crop tool is embedded in the PhotoPage class; should be broken out in the near future.  Probably will do when another editing tool is introduced and the abstractions become more necessary.",
5650,"201: Rule-of-thirds lines.  However, moving and resizing the crop is now unacceptably slow.",
5651,"This fixes maintaining the crop for rotated images.  Now, crop is rotated along with image.",
5652,Crop now following photo orientation.,
5653,Fixed bug where crop would fail on small photos.,
5654,60: Crop tool.,
5655,Fixed a bug in photo removal.,
5656,Performance boost on resizing thumbnails in view ... came to me over lunch.,
5657,"Major refactoring in preparation for photo editing.  New Photo object centralizes pixbuf generation and photo manipulation, and introduces GObject signals into the system so various interested parties (esp. various pages) are notified when a photo is modified or removed.  Also refactored Dimensions struct, as what started out as a utility record has become a first-class citizen of Shotwell.  Also, while refactoring, went ahead and made changes to reflect Yorba's coding style (i.e. camelCase for variables -> underscored_names).  In the process, knocked out #198: Databases and thumbnail cache always in sync with modifications.  #202: Black-and-white shading with crop tool.",
5658,"Basic crop UI functionality, although some UI spottiness and crop is not persisted.",
5659,Early crop functionality.,
5660,191: Accelerators for fullscreen view.  Crop button (but no implementation!) added.,
5661,Fixed bug where rotating a photo in fullscreen was not reflected in the events directory page.,
5662,Now refreshing files & folders during import to workaround #192.  Optimization in CollectionLayout to deal with now having multiple pages with large thumbnail collections.,
5663,This fixes the problem with fullscreen occassionally not displaying the initial image.,
5664,177: Fullscreen F11 with floating control bar.  #71: Let use select key photo for each event.  Added gphoto macros to prevent worrisome compiler warnings.,
5665,185: pkg-config checks for package existance.,
5666,Forgot to add .ui file.,
5667,67: Events.  Lots of refactoring to accomdate database and UI changes.  Another valac bug found in,"CollectionLayout.vala, probably related to generics.  Will fix soon."
5668,"Lots of changes working toward events, including some database work.",
5669,56: Sort by EXIF date.,
5670,148: View/Titles checkbox.,
5671,172: Now handle situations where we need to ask user to unmount camera (or tell them to close application,holding the lock).
5672,170: Auto-unmount on startup (when notified by nautilus).  #171: Auto-unmount when running and notified by,nautilus.  Added (sudo) make install and (sudo) make uninstall.  Added .desktop file (necessary for nautilus  integration).
5673,167: libunique.  #168:Switch to camera view on startup.  #169:Switch to camera view when user attaches on while,"running.  Also, get_instance() to reflect that Shotwell is single-window app."
5674,150: Progress bar is in better shape.  Fine-tuning discussed in #92.  #145 and #146:Cameras detected,"at initialization and runtime, and appear as children of ""Cameras"" in the sidebar."
5675,141: Next/Previous in full-window view added.,
5676,"150: Ugly progress bar, but it's there.  Useful even for development to see what's going on.  Finer-detailed UI",work to come.
5677,"147: Fixed, although icons would be nice.  #149:Import in background added.  Rotate buttons now have text.",
5678,138: Actions and ActionGroups now handled in intelligent manner.  Also added moveable thumb between sidebar and,view pages.
5679,Whoops.,
5680,57: Import photos from camera.  Tons of refactoring to share layout and functionality between multiple pages.,
5681,Photo full-window view available by double-clicking on photo.  libgphoto.vapi.,
5682,Forgot to commit icons in last update.  Also added first steps toward sorting.,
5683,"59: Rotate photo w/ EXIF, including toolbar button.",
5684,JPEG/EXIF rotations implemented and stored in the photo file itself.  Further work to be done before marking off ,the ticket.
5685,Backed out a strategy of incrementally loading EXIF data.,
5686,"libexif bindings built and now in use throughout app.  Need to clean up display before claiming tickets.  Also, ",first stab at adding a full-page view of photos.
5687,Fixed a corner case in the layout code.,
5688,"Major tune-up of collection layout as well as appearance.  This scales well to 1200 photos, although resizing ",the thumbs at that number leaves something to be desired.  Fixes #89.
5689,"More work to be done for aesthetics, but this fixes #93 in a big way.",
5690,Fixed a bug where the thumbnails were not improved after a repack().,"Also, timing repacks."
5691,Speed improvements for large photo collections.  More work to be done.  ,95: Three-tier thumbnail system in memory (JPEG -> unscaled pixbuf -> scaled pixbuf).  #94: Fixed.
5692,Improvement of scaling speed.  Now storing three persistent thumbnail ,"caches (360px, 128px, 64px).  How these work need to be reviewed."
5693,"55: Slider control added.  Also, refactored code so CollectionPage",provides menu bar and tool bar.  Eventually AppWindow will become a  controller merely switching between various pages (views).
5694,85: Added right-click/Remove on thumbnail.  #87: Photo scaling is,"improved by generating higher-quality thumbnails to disk and better  in-memory scaling.  #90 and #91: Detailed in Wiki, implemented  throughout."
5695,Thumbnail dimensions are now stored in a table rather than fetched from ,"disk and examined.  This speeds up init time, esp. with large  collections."
5696,Updated the cache to store JPEG data in memory and convert to pixbufs on ,"the fly.  Thumbnails only hold pixbufs when they're on screen, otherwise  they're tossed.  Fixed #86."
5697,"Added adjustable thumbnail sizing, however, need to add UI slider for ",ticket to be marked off.  Implemented a persistent thumbnail cache. Began work to have thumbnail objects on-screen load and unload their  pixbufs dynamically.
