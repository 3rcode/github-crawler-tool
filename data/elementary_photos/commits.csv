268,Update vapi files (#650),Copied in the changes from the Shotwell vapi files and fixed up and tested the associated vala. All of these code changes relate to importing and previewing files from a camera which I've just tested still works with my Pixel 4a. I also changed how the image-missing icon is loaded in the import page as this was not working and causing criticals in the terminal. This should get us some memory leak fixes as we've now got rid of a lot of the manual memory management that wasn't done right anyway.,Update vapi files (#650),Copied in the changes from the Shotwell vapi files and fixed up and tested the associated vala.
