131,Re-implements the Bubble widget.,"The old Bubble widget design was complicated and used a GridLayout with multiple dummy widgets solely to get an arrow placed as desired. Multiple magic numbers like 99 columns or 99 rows were undocumented and unintuitive. Probably some of these numbers even add unnecessary limitations to the Bubble widget. The Bubble widget was fused with the 'BubbleContent' which by design makes the Bubble widget feel very unflexible. Sizing the Bubble according to the content was unintuitive if not even impossible for some cases and the arrow positioning was relying on magic numbers as well. Lastly, the old implementation lacked test coverage with very few tests that did not even cover the core logic of the widget. The new implementation reduces the core logic (formerly ""on_arrow_pos"", ~100 lines of code) to ~30 lines plus a well documented lookup structure without magic but intuitive values. Furthermore, it adds proper inline documentation for maintainers. Furthermore, completely flexible arrow positioning was implemented and allows free positioning of the arrow to all sides of the content by selecting a (relative) position on the Bubble widget border. The BubbleContent widget is a seperate styled BoxLayout and the code and documentation makes clear that any other Widet or Layout can be placed as content. The background_color, border and border_auto_scale properties have been attached to the BubbleContent instead of the Bubble itself which removes the unnecessary connections between the Bubble itself and it's BubbleContent. Properties, that refer to multiple dimensions are cleanly integrated through ReferenceListProperties. The rework of the Bubble widget fixes the issue #4348 which had been opened in 2016 and remained unsolved. Minimal changes are necessary for existing applications using the Bubble widget: - A BubbleContent (can be any Layout or a single Widget) is added as only child   to the Bubble (similarly to the ActionBar/ActionView widgets). - The background_color, border and border_auto_scale properties have   been removed from the Bubble as they belong to the BubbleContent Signed-off-by: AnthonyZimmermann anthony.zimmermann@protonmail.com",Re-implements the Bubble widget.,"The old Bubble widget design was complicated and used a GridLayout with multiple dummy widgets solely to get an arrow placed as desired.

262,Fix PermissionError when reconnecting mtdev input devices (#7587),"The Linux kernel creates input devices then hands permission management off to udev. This results in a period of time when the device exists, but is readable only by root. The MTDMotionEventProvider handles reconnects by spinning in a loop waiting for the device to reappear. As soon as the device reappears, the provider immediately attempts to create a new mtdev Device. This happens faster than udev can update the file permissions so the Device construction fails raising an error causing no further reconnects to be attempted. This patch adds some spinning code to the Device object to re-try opening the device file for a period of time if a PermissionError was received. The retries will be applied on initial connection to the MT device (in case the device happened to be newly attached just as the application was starting) as well as reconnection attempts. Attempts are time-limited so that real system configuration errors will still be detected, but long enough of a duration that any reasonable system should have enough time for udev to fix the permissions. For reference, a Raspberry Pi 4 (a small single-board computer) takes about 0.6s between creating the file and fixing the permissions.",Fix PermissionError when reconnecting mtdev input devices (#7587),"The Linux kernel creates input devices then hands permission management off to udev.

1107,Fix issues #6226 and #6227 in multiline-enabled TextInput  (#6249)," Add TextInput._visible_lines_range attr (+minor fix)  TextInput._visible_lines_range attribute contains the range of lines which were partially (at least 1px width line) or fully rendered in the TextInput's viewport during the last _update_graphics() call. The attribute is meant to be mainly used in TextInput's scrolling unittests. The minor fix makes _update_graphics() method stop rendering the lines which share no pixels with current viewport and interrupt the for loop after the last visible line.  Draw cursor only inside the TextInput's viewport  This commit implements drawing the cursor correctly on the border between the padding and actual viewport of the TextInput widget. The cursor is fully drawn inside the viewport, partially drawn on the border and not drawn outside the viewport.  Fix scrolling with ctrl+cursor_up, ctrl+cursor_down  As the TextInput.do_cursor_movement documentation states the ""ctrl+cursor_up"" and ""ctrl+cursor_down"" combinations should scroll text one line up or down respectivelly without changing the cursor position. Also the text should be scrolled both when the cursor is inside the viewport and outside of it. These 2 conditions were broken and are fixed by this commit.   Don't change cursor position when scrolling TextInput   Fix TextInput's viewport freeze on scroll_up   TextInput.on_touch_down was checking the possibility to scroll_up using the positions of the rendered lines' rects. These positions are not updated when the lines are skipped (e.g. during fast scroll or ctrl+cursor_home) which lead to scroll freeze  Reduce code duplication in TextInputGraphicTest",Fix issues #6226 and #6227 in multiline-enabled TextInput  (#6249),"Add TextInput._visible_lines_range attr (+minor fix) TextInput._visible_lines_range attribute contains the range of lines which were partially (at least 1px width line) or fully rendered in the TextInput's viewport during the last _update_graphics() call.

This attempts to solve Issue #5984 without causing more problems for Issue #5558.   Correct argument to extras_require.   Refactor the declaration and usage of Cython   Use setuptools.setup by default if available for import.  The objective for that complicated import/cython is commented.  Also have more specific variable names, and have their usage be   clarified.   Remove Cython from install_requires as it already is declared under   setup_requires, and that it conflicts with install_requires due to   issues in setuptools.   https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/209   https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/391   This commit goes back to breaking installation in environments without   Cython, but should be rectified in the next commit.   Actually fix the specific usage of Cython   In order for setup.py to make use of the Cython installed during by   the setup_requires to be usable, it must be imported after it is   installed by that step, thus it cannot be done at the top level and   this can be achieved by importing it when it's actually called. A   build_ext factory function is created for this.   Still allow whatever Cython already present on the current environment   be attempted to be used.  This may end up being unnecessary as if it   is always declared in setup_requires (which isn't currently the case   due to the complicated/documented block), it should pull in the   exact/supported version of Cython for usage.  This should be   investigated so that this complicated logic may be avoided.   Make distutils happy by not using factory function   As it turns out, calling setup.py build_ext will result in a code path   within setuptools that will invoke distutils in a way that forces an   issubclass check, which ultimately results in an exception due to that   function not being a class.  To fix this, we go back to constructing a base class except also using   the ""new"" style class (to make Python 2 happy) so that the new   method will actually be called so that the logic to select the Cython   version of build_ext will be invoked.  Also use the super class protocol to invoke parent methods.   Declare version bounds directly on setup_requires   This allows us to fully remove the brittle version checks  Also this allows us to directly declare setup_requires if Cython is   definitely required, as this would allow the correct version to be   installed directly by setuptools during the execution of the setup   step.  No need to check for failed Cython imports due to the presence of the   setup_requires declaration.   Add comment explaining the initialisation routine for KivyBuildExt.   Details of how setuptools deals with both cmdclass and when setup_requires dependencies come in to scope are both relevant.  Bring comment in to line with earlier changes.  The cython checks are significantly simpler now, and the rationale is also slightly different.",Change check for Cython to attempt fallback to setuptools on supporte… (#5998),"Change check for Cython to attempt fallback to setuptools on supported platforms. This attempts to solve Issue #5984 without causing more problems for Issue #5558. Correct argument to extras_require. Refactor the declaration and usage of Cython Use setuptools.setup by default if available for import. The objective for that complicated import/cython is commented. Also have more specific variable names, and have their usage be   clarified.

3745,Added Spinner text property update when values are updated.,"If Spinner's values property is updated, the Spinner text is not changing. This is the wrong behavior. Let's make some examples:  User creates the Spinner with the values ('Home', 'Work', 'Holidays') and without the text property set. Spinner will show no text when some options are available; there will be no default option shown - and it is bad for the user experience. User creates the Spinner with the empty values property. Then the Spinner instance is updated with the list of ('Home', 'Work', 'Holidays') but Spinner wont show any default value - empty text string suggests that no options are available to choose from. User creates the Spinner with the values set to ('Home', 'Work', 'Holidays') and text set to 'Home'. Then Spinner values are updated to ('New Home', 'Another Work', 'Next Holidays'). The text will still show 'Home' as selected value, so without the user interaction the selection will be wrong.  I have added the text_autoupdate property that indicates if the user want the Spinner to automatically set the text property to values[0]. If set to True and values is not empty, the Spinner will automatically set its text to values[0]. Else, it will leave the text value untouched. I believe it will make Spinner widget funtionality and complexity better,",Added Spinner text property update when values are updated.,"If Spinner's values property is updated, the Spinner text is not changing.

Also, capabilities are globally missing in Kivy, so we cannot query the device for some informations. Once we improved the core base, we can activate the code related to capabilities here. This part of the code has been first written using Pyobjus, but objc-protocol was not implemented, i started to rewrite from scratch using AVFoundation tutorial.

This in turn caused lang._handlers to unnecessarily keep it alive.  The fix: I let Widget._proxy_ref be generated lazily on demand instead of relying on Widget.__init__: whenever the user calls Widget.proxy_ref for the first time, Widget._proxy_ref will be initialized.

This behaviour/widget has     been renamed to `ScatterLayout`.  The :class:`RelativeLayout` now only     supports relative position (and cant be roatated or scaled), so that the     implemetation can be optimized and avoid the heavier calculations from     :class:`Scatter` (e.g. inverse matrix, recaculating multiple properties,     etc)  I was struggling why is it that it says it cannot be rotated or scaled?. I had a Widget that inherits from RelativeLayout in which I was able to Rotate and Scale without any problem.

10159,"Selection had no memory of previously selected items, because the data used in","the examples were just strings primarily. To further development with a more realistic environment, a DataStore class was created, with simple set and get property methods, operating on a key into a dict of records. The simple scheme for the records is that they must all contain an is_selected boolean for storing the state of selection. The fruit dataset was modified accordingly, into two datastores: categories and fruits. A new simple dataset was also created for integer data used in several examples. For view instances to be associated with data records in a datastore, an index property was added to SelectableItem. This index into the data list is used in selection operations to keep selection of data items in sync with item view instances. When creating item view instances in ListView there is now a lookup call to the datastore to check for selection of the associated data item record. The data item record tested so far carries an is_selected boolean, but the code was written to allow for an is_selected() function.","Selection had no memory of previously selected items, because the data used in","the examples were just strings primarily.
