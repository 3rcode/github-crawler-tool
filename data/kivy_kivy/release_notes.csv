Index,Release Note
1,"The Kivy team is happy to announce the release of Kivy 2.1.0.
Kivy is a full-featured framework for creating novel and performant user
interfaces, such as multi-touch applications, released under the MIT license.
The framework works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and Raspberry Pi.
Installation instructions and Kivy Docs are hosted on the link

Currently supported Python versions are 3.7-3.10
macOS module now supports both module and module hardware.
module for module pre-built wheels are now available on PyPi. 
Single module wheel for module module and module is now available on PyPi.

Features marked as deprecated on 1.6.0 and prior versions will be removed in Kivy 2.2.0.
Highlights

[#7658]: Feature: Added EventManagerBase. We can now register managers that selectively process inputs e.g. touch and decide how to dispatch it to the widget tree. module and module was added to Widget to handle generic motion inputs from the managers.
[#7270]: Graphics: We now check whether the user called GL instructions from an external thread and raise an error.
[#7293]: Properties: Added dynamic screen density/dpi support. KV code referencing density e.g. module will now update if the window dpi changes.
[#7371]: KV: Allow using f-strings in KV-lang.
[#7424]: Properties: Speed up bare widget creation (3X) and property dispatching/setting.
[#7587]: Fix PermissionError when reconnecting mtdev input devices.
[#7637]: Added Custom titlebar support.
[#7642]: TextInput loading time optimization for large texts.
[#7663]: Add python3.10 support.
[#7678]: Add support for Apple Silicon.

2,"The Kivy team is happy to announce the release of Kivy 2.0.0.
Kivy is a full-featured framework for creating novel and performant user
interfaces, such as multi-touch applications, released under the MIT license.
The framework works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and Raspberry Pi.

This is the first release to not support Python 2.7 - hence the increase in Kivy's major version to 2. Currently supported Python versions are 3.6 - 3.9.
Installation has been largely simplified and all platforms now support a simpler module install (see below).

Installation instructions and Kivy documentation is available on the Kivy website:
module
or on link.
Installation notes
Kivy can now be installed into your Virtual Environment on Windows, Linux, OSX, and RPi simply with:
module
module For the RPi, additional system dependencies should be pre-installed.
These selectors allow specifying dependency categories, instead of having to pin Kivy's module dependencies to specific versions. These selectors will install the proper dependency version to match Kivy's version.
Additionally, by default, Kivy will install the module dependencies even if module is not specified. In order to facilitate easier install for GUI installation users e.g. in PyCharm. However, this may change as module evolves and module should be manually specified. Use module's module flag to disable it.
See the link for more details.
Installation from source has also been simplified, relying on module's module. See the link.
Highlights

[#6351]: Support for Python 2 has been dropped and Kivy source code is now incompatible with Python 2.
[#6368]: Support for async has been added to Kivy. Kivy can now run cooperatively, in the same process or thread as asynchronous code.

We currently support the stdlib asyncio framework and the excellent trio framework. See the link for how to use it.

Branching
The new stable branch is now derived from the 2.0.0 tag. The oldest stable branch has been renamed to stable-1.11.1. If you still want to compile on android with this branch, use ""kivy==stable-1.11.1"" as requirement. We do not support previous versions, so if things doesn't work anymore due to changes in python-for-android, please take time to update your application.

Kivy Team
https://kivy.org/#aboutus"
3,"This release fixed some issues with the docs, the CI, and Kivy dependencies that was introduced in module (https://github.com/kivy/kivy/pull/6357)."
4,"We are pleased to announce Kivy 1.11.0.
Kivy is a full featured framework for creating novel and performant user
interfaces, such as multitouch applications, released under the MIT license.
The framework works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and Raspberry Pi.

This is the last release to support Python 2.7. The next release will only support Python 3.5+.
This is also the first release with Kivy wheels for Linux (3.5+ only, Windows and macOS already have wheels).
Windows dependencies are now under the module namespace external to Kivy, rather than module under Kivy. Whether you're upgrading Kivy, please pin the dependency versions when installing because Kivy binary dependencies are not generally backward compatible [#6312].
The module namespace is similarly being transitioned to the module namespace.

See below for more details.
Downloads and installation instructions are available on the Kivy website:
module
Installation notes
Windows

[#6324]: We are transitioning the kivy Windows dependencies from the module namespace stored under module to the module namespace stored under module. Pip is sometimes not able to distinguish between these two formats, so follow the instructions below.
If you're not upgrading Kivy, please make sure to pin your module dependencies to the versions that was on pypi when your Kivy was released so that you don't get newer incompatible dependencies.
If you're upgrading Kivy, manually uninstall all the module dependencies because pip will not uninstall them when you're upgrading. Then re-install the module dependencies as instructed on the Kivy website.
If you're installing the first time, simply follow the instructions on Kivy's website.

Linux and macOS
The new Linux wheels (#6248) can be installed with just module, however, just like on macOS it comes without the Gstreamer dependencies so it has no video and minor audio support. For video/audio support, please install ffpyplayer and set module in the environment, or install kivy using an alternative method that provides these dependencies.
Highlights
Support

[#5947]: We have moved from IRC to Discord. However, there's matrix integration if you are unable to use Discord. See https://kivy.org/doc/master/contact.html#discord.

Configuration

[#6192]: Support for environmental variables that control the config in the form of module has been added. E.g. setting module in the environment is the same as calling module or setting the module in the module section of the config to module. Note that underscores are not allowed in the section names.

Any key set this will way will take precedence on the loaded module file. Support for this can be disabled by setting the enviornmental variable module and the environment will not be read for configuration options.
KV lang

[#6257]: A new KV-Python integration event that fires when all the KV rules of the widget has been applied, module, has been added to the module class. This event fires for a widget when all the KV rules it participates in has been applied and module has been initialized. Binding to this event will let you execute code for your widget without having to schedule the code for the next clock cycle.

Similarly, a new module method was added to module that is called in order to apply the KV rules of that widget class. Inheriting and overwriting that method will give you the oppertunity to execute code before any KV rules are applied.
Garden
We are transitioning the Kivy garden flowers from the module namespace stored under module or module to the normal python package format module namespace stored under module. With the new configuration, garden flowers will be module installable, support cython flowers, and not require the custom garden tool.
We're hoping to transition all flowers to the new format, however, for now many flowers still require installation by the garden tool.
For users, see https://kivy-garden.github.io/index.html#generalusageguidelines. For developers, see https://kivy-garden.github.io/index.html#developmentguidelines for how to start a new flower, and https://kivy-garden.github.io/index.html#guideformigratingflowersfromlegacystructure for how to migrate existing flowers to the new format.
Other

[#6186]: Live resizing has been added for desktop platforms that use the SDL2 window backend.

Deprecated

[#6313]: Pygame has been deprecated. We urge users who have been using pygame to try SDL2 and
our other providers. If there are any reasons why Pygame is used instead of SDL2 please let
us know so we can fix them.

Deprecation warnings have also been added to everything that has been deprecated in the past.
Breaking changes

[#6095]: Changed the Android version to use module for the configuration and added a missing dot to the config file name.
[#5340]: Removed DropDown.dismiss in on_touch_down so it is only dismissed in on_touch_up.
[#5990, #6169]: We now use pytest to run our tests rather than nose.
[#5968]: Listview and all its associated modules has finally be removed in favor of RecycleView.

5,"This was supposedly a bugfix releases, but a few new features have 
managed to get in, aside that, a lot of fixes are included.
Highlighted changes:

It's now possible to query Window information with the SDL provider.
SVG support improvements.
Export_to_png now preserves widget's alpha.
It's now possible to define a custom comparison for properties, to 
   manage dispatching better.
Layouts' add_widget method now accept the module argument that 
   module's does.
Fix for infamous SDL window issue on Linux.
module property of widget now restores the previous value of 
   disabled of children on unset.
The tuio implementation now uses the new module library instead of 
   the bundled oscAPI module, this solves a lot of issues with python3 
   and massively increase performances. The old OSC package is still 
   shipped, but will be removed in future releases.
On Linux, probesysfs input detection doesn't depend on getconf 
   anymore, which makes it more portable.

This is the last release to officially support python 3.3 and 3.4.
For technical reasons, there is no 3.7 wheels for Windows yet, they will 
come soon after our continuous integration infrastructure allows it.
