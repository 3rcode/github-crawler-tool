6,Introduce google_firestore_field resource. (#7853) (#14512)," Introduce google_firestore_field resource.  Introduces a single resource for managing Firestore fields, matching the REST API. Introduces 2 primary divergences from the proto/REST API: 1) Firestore fields do not support deletion (this is because all fields    implicitly can exist in a schemaless system). Deletion of a terraform    resource will clear any ""overrides"" for this field (TTL or indexing). 2) Single field indexes in the proto API were overly nested to allow    reusing the same resource for composite indexes. The terraform    resource unnests the 1-length field in the indexes list. fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/12151 fixes https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/11419   Address feedback in review (mostly minor cleanups).   Fix whitespace and add database to basic example.   Signed-off-by: Modular Magician link"

692,Add a module field to GKE node pools and to node pool defaults for GKE clusters. (#6744) (#13049),"This PR implements the feature request from link. By adding a logging_variant field within the node_pool_defaults, GKE users will be able to select a cluster-wide default value for the logging agent of the node pools in a cluster. For example, by specifying ```terraform resource ""google_container_cluster"" ""with_logging_variant_node_pool_default"" {   name               = ""example-cluster""   location           = ""us-central1-f""   initial_node_count = 1 node_pool_defaults {     node_config_defaults {       logging_variant = ""MAX_THROUGHPUT""     }   } } ``` every newly created node pool in the cluster will have the max throughput logging agent unless this is explicitly overridden at the node pool level (see the link for more information). GKE users will also be able to select a logging variant at the node pool level. For example, by specifying ```terraform resource ""google_container_cluster"" ""with_logging_variant_node_pool_default"" {   name               = ""example-cluster""   location           = ""us-central1-f""   initial_node_count = 1 node_pool_defaults {     node_config_defaults {       logging_variant = ""DEFAULT""     }   } } resource ""google_container_node_pool"" ""with_high_throughput_logging_variant"" {   name    = ""example-node-pool-0""   cluster = google_container_cluster.with_logging_variant_node_pool_default.name } resource ""google_container_node_pool"" ""with_high_throughput_logging_variant"" {   name    = ""example-node-pool-1""   cluster = google_container_cluster.with_logging_variant_node_pool_default.name   node_config {     logging_variant = ""MAX_THROUGHPUT""   } } ``` example-node-pool-0 (as well as the default node pool) will have the default logging agent (see the link for more information), but example-node-pool-1 will have the max throughput agent.

3000,Cloud Storage: docs improvements for automatic service account (#3903) (#7119),"I've improved the documentation with warnings, cross-references and additional examples around appropriate use of the google_storage_project_service_account resource to ensure the proper existence of the Cloud Storage automatic internal service account prior to utilising any features which depend on the same. There are various subtleties around the lifecycle of this service account which may be non-obvious when using these features.  Moreover, the service account is always implicitly created as a side-effect of operations expected to be read-only (clicking in the UI or making a GET call to an API are sufficient). It is possible to write Terraform code which assumes the existence of the service account through interpolating the project ID into the well-known email address format and the same Terraform will work in some or many cases when the service account already exists. Such Terraform contains latent failure conditions and cannot apply cleanly to new projects. We must be defensive in these cases and ensure users are aware of the relevant data source and the importance of its use. The documentation was already good for the creation of google_storage_notification objects and the associated permissions required on pub/sub topics. I've added warnings relating to the use of the data source when specifying Cloud KMS keys on storage buckets, which did not have any hooks on the storage_bucket resource's documentation to these subtleties.

But the docs say it must be at least one, so this PR proposes a tweak to update that. More context, from https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler:  Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.7, you can specify a minimum size of zero for your node pool. This allows your node pool to scale down completely if the instances within aren't required to run your workloads. However, while a node pool can scale to a zero size, the overall cluster size does not scale down to zero nodes (as at least one node is always required to run system Pods)."

Also, add some tests for its behaviour, as well as some documentation for it. Note that this is largely an implementation of the ideas discussed in  #2118, except we're not using CustomizeDiff to reject deletions without our special flag set, because CustomizeDiff apparently doesn't run on Delete. Who knew? This leaves us rejecting the deletion at apply time, which is less than ideal, but the only other option I see is to silently not delete the resource, and that's... not ideal, either. This also stops the app_engine sub-block on google_project from forcing new when it's removed, and sets it to computed, so users can safely move from using the sub-block to using the resource without state surgery or deleting their entire project. This does mean it's impossible to delete an App Engine application from a sub-block now, but seeing as that was the same situation before, and we just papered over it by making the project recreate itself in that situation, and people Were Not Fans of that, I'm considering that an acceptable casualty."
5756,Fix trailing comma,JSON is the worst.
5757,"Fix Dana's comments, expand images to self_links.","Fix Dana's comments, one of which exposed a bug: we weren't actually fixing the diff. Because resolveImage can return multiple formats, and only returns a self_link if a self_link is passed in, it was diffing more often than not against a self_link supplied in the config. We just had a bug in our CustomizeDiff function that concealed this. I added the resolvedImageSelfLink helper function to turn the output from resolveImage into a self_link, which fixes the problem. It also has the knock-on effect of fixing #2067 at the same time, which is nice. I decided to add another function instead of just modifying resolveImage to always return a self_link because I don't want to deal with the backwards compatibility problems of changing how we're storing a bunch of things in state this close to 1.19.0. And honestly, we should probably just be storing the self_link always, anyways."

5864,Fix perma-diff on instance templates.,"When using instance templates, if you use one of our image shorthands at the moment, you'll get a perma-diff. This is because the config gets resolved to another format before it is set in state, and so we need to set that other format in state. Unfortunately, resolving images requires network access, so we have to do this with CustomizeDiff. CustomizeDiff was having trouble (I think? More on this below) on setting a field as not ForceNew once the field was already set, so I moved the decision for whether a field was ForceNew or not into CustomizeDiff. I also resolved the old and new images, and if they were the same, cleared the diff. Unfortunately, you can't actually clear a field on a sub-block right now. You have to clear top-level fields only. So this will currently throw an error. I opened hashicorp/terraform#18795 to fix that. Once that's merged, and we vendor it here, this patch fixes the problem. If hashicorp/terraform#18795 doesn't get merged, the next best workaround is to keep track of all the fields under module with a diff in our CustomizeDiff, check whether they've all changed or not, and if they've all changed, clear the changes on module, which I think will resolve the issue. That's just a massive pain, unfortunately."

Instead, let's just always set them. This fixes our test failures about self_links not matching names. Also, relative links are safer than just image names, as Terraform wouldn't notice if another project's image of the same name got used instead of your project's.

5932,Fix panic on empty list for authorized masters' module (#1904)," test empty authorized masters' cidr_blocks  When the module isn't simply blank but contains an empty list as in module a panic occurs looking something like module which we trigger by altering the first step to contain the HCL notation for an empty list instead of simply an empty string. In order to accomplish this, the tests had to be modified to accept an emptyValue string as well which contains the content of the module string when the cidrBlocks array is empty. This maintains the old behavior of the original tests when module is an empty string, while also facilating differing behavior for the new testcase by setting module to whichever string we want to test instead. I don't think this is very clean, but I guess it's pragmatic enough. I'll hear if this is a thorn in the side to someone :smirk:.  avoid panic on cidr_block type assertion  This is basically the fix. Since the value can be nil, we want to ensure we handle a failure during the assertion since we know that asserting module conforms to module will cause a run-time panic.  flatten to config on empty list for cidr_blocks  since an empty list for cidrBlocks constitutes valid input, one should return a map containing an empty list for the cidr_blocks field instead of a nil value. The nil value is only appropriate when the input Config is also nil."

6038,Make licenses field of images computed.,"Images now have a licenses field, which lets users specify licenses to use on an image. But official images already have licenses on them, adn so Terraform is reading those as a diff. To preserve backwards compatiblity and avoid a breaking change that would require all module users to update their configs, I've set the field to computed. This means that if no licenses are set in the config, there can be licenses in the config without prompting a diff. Obviously, this isn't ideal, as it means you can't ever remove all the licenses from an image, but I think the benefits here outweigh the drawbacks."

This PR relaxes the requirement that a project needs to be set for the 'service_account_key' resource, 'service_account' datasource and 'service_account_key' datasource, but will error if we try to build a fully qualified name from a service account id when no project can be found. This also cleans up 'serviceAccountFQN' so it is slightly easier to follow and return an error if there is no project but we need one to build the service account fully qualified name. Fixes: #1655"

This can be supported by sending the filename parameter instead of the build parameter, however only one can be sent.  Acceptance testing for cloudbuild trigger with filename  Ensure that when a cloudbuild repo trigger is created with a filename, that filename is what actually ends up in the cloud.  Don't specify ""by default"" in cloudbuild-trigger.  The docs shouldn't say that ""cloudbuild.yaml"" is used by default. There is no default from the APIs, but the console suggest using this value.

6213,"Lions, tigers, and services being enabled with ""precondition failed"", oh my! (#1565)","  Use errwrap to retain original error   Use built-in Page function, only return names when listing services   This removes the custom logic on pagination and uses the built-in Page function in the SDK to make things a bit simpler. Additionally, I added a field filter to only return service names, which drastically reduces the size of the API call (important for slow connections, given how frequently this function is executed). Also added errwrap to better trace where errors originate.  Add helper function for diffing string slices  This just looked really nasty inline  Batch 20 services at a time, handle precondition failed, better errwrap  This commit does three things:   It batches services to be enabled 20 at a time. The API fails if you try to enable more than 20 services, and this is documented in the SDK and API. I learned this the hard way. I think Terraform should ""do the right thing"" here and batch them in series' of twenty, which is what this does. Each batch is tried in serial, but I think making it parallelized is not worth the complexity tradeoffs.   Handle the precondition failed error that occurs randomly. This just started happened, but it affects at least two APIs consistently, and a rudimentary test showed that it failed 78% of the time (78/100 times in an hour). We should fix this upstream, but that failure rate also necessitates (in my opinion) some mitigation on the Terraform side until a fix is in place at the API level.   Use errwrap on errors for better tracing. It was really difficult to trace exactly which error was being throw. That's fixed.   Updates from code review "

6254,Guard against eventually consistent services,"When enabling services, after the waiter returns, list the enabled services and ensure the ones we enabled are in there. If not, retry. May not always resolve #1393, but should help. Unfortunately, the real answer is probably either:  For us to try and get the API updated to only return the waiter when the service will consistently be available. I don't know how feasible this is, but I'm willing to open a ticket. For us to build retries into ~all our resources to retry for a set amount of time when a service not enabled error is returned. This would greatly slow down the provider in the case of the service legitimately not being enabled, but is how other providers handle this class of problem.  Unfortunately, due to the eventual consistency at play, this is a hard issue to reproduce and prove, though it matches with my experience--while testing this patch, one of the tests failed with the error that the serviceusage API hadn't been enabled, but only on step 4 of the test, when calls had already succeeded. Which suggests eventual consistency, to me. Regardless, this patch shouldn't hurt and should mostly be an imperceptible change to users, and should make instances like #1393 less likely."

This fixes the matter by checking the error returned from each of those, and if it looks like an API not enabled error, logging it at warning level instead of returning it as an error, which will let the read proceed as usual."

6390,1300 Supporting regional clusters for node pools (#1320),"This PR also switched us to using the beta API in all cases, and that had a side effect which is worth noting, note included here for posterity. ===== The problem is, we add a GPU, and as per the docs, GKE adds a taint to the node pool saying ""don't schedule here unless you tolerate GPUs"", which is pretty sensible. Terraform doesn't know about that, because it didn't ask for the taint to be added. So after apply, on refresh, it sees the state of the world (1 taint) and the state of the config (0 taints) and wants to set the world equal to the config. This introduces a diff, which makes the test fail - tests fail if there's a diff after they run. Taints are a beta feature, though. :) And since the config doesn't contain any taints, terraform didn't see any beta features in that node pool ... so it used to send the request to the v1 API. And since the v1 API didn't return anything about taints (since they're a beta feature), terraform happily checked the state of the world (0 taints I know about) vs the config (0 taints), and all was well. This PR makes every node pool refresh request hit the beta API. So now terraform finds out about the taints (which were always there) and the test fails (which it always should have done). The solution is probably to write a little bit of code which suppresses the report of the diff of any taint with value 'nvidia.com/gpu', but only if GPUs are enabled. I think that's something that can be done."

This can get stuck from quota issues, or it can run in parallel to other tests. The policy currently limits the projects that images can be used from to the project running the test, but a lot of our tests use images from the debian-cloud project. This just updates the policy to allow debian-cloud images to be used, too, so even if the policy doesn't properly get cleaned up or if it runs in parallel with other tests, our tests are still within the policy. The real fix for this is to set up a separate org for testing, so we're not modifying the test environment under running tests, but that'll take a bit more time, so this is the patchfix until that can happen."

We even had a test for the code for this! Then we updated the validation for the provider, and forgot to validate filepaths as ok. So provider validation failed. And because our test only tested the config validation, and not the provider validation, our tests thought this was just fine still. This fixes that oversight, accepting filepaths as valid.

Only NS records for the naked domain of the managed zone can't be removed; all other NS records can be. Because of this, 1.2.0 contains a bug where all NS records are removed. This update fixes the situation to only use special handling on NS records that are for the naked root domain of the managed zone, and treat all subdomain NS records as normal records. It also adds a test to ensure this functionality. Fixes #729."

I added it back, added some tests to use it, included it in the docs, and basically tried to put things back the way they were. The main difference now is that the auto_create_subnetworks field defaults to true, and we want to keep that behaviour to avoid a breaking change.

Move common instance code into utils.go  Methods used by both resource_compute_instance and resource_compute_instance_template are currently spread between their respective files, and utils.go. This commit moves them all into utils.go for the sake of consistency. It may be worth considering an instance_common.go file or similar.

Add tests for compute instance template Alias IP ranges   Mark instance template region as computed   We compute it from the subnet its network interfaces are in. Note this is not new behaviour - I believe it was erroneously missing the computed flag.  Support guest accelerators for instance templates  Since most of the code is already there.   Add a test for using 'address' rather than 'network_ip' for instance templates   Don't mark assigned_nat_ip as deprecated   Remove network_interface schema fields that don't make sense for a compute instance template   Add newline after count in instance template docs   Don't try to dedupe guest accelerator expansion code   The API calls to Google to create guest accelerators take different values for instances and instance templates. Instance templates don't have a zone and can thus only be passed a guest accelerator name.   Use ParseNetworkFieldValue instead of getNetworkLink   Add support for parsing regional fields, and subnetworks specifically   Currently unused because subnetworks may have a separate project from that of the instance using them, which complicates looking up the project field.  Fall back to provider region when parsing regional field values  Also slightly refactors getXFromSchema field helper functions for readability.   Revert to assigned_nat_ip in compute instance docs   Add beta scaffolding to compute instance and compute instance template   Note these resources don't currently use beta features - this is futureproofing.   Fix indentation in comment about instance template alias IP ranges   Consolidate metadata helper functions in metadata.go   Move compute instance (and template) related helpers into their own file "

7184,Skip migrations if we're not running acc tests.,
7185,Fix compute_instance migration bug.,"module's StateVersion was set to 2. Then we released a migration to v3, but never updated the StateVersion to 3, meaning the migration was never run. When we added the migration for disks, we bumped to 4, bypassing 3 altogher. In theory, this is fine, and is expected; after all, some people may have state in version 0 and need to upgrade all the way to 4, so our schema migration function is supposed to support this. Unfortunately, for migrations to v2, v3, and v4 of our schema, the migration returned after each migration, instead of falling through. This meant that (in this case), version 2 would see it needs to be version 4, run the state migration to version 3, then return, setting its StateVersion to 4, which means the migration from 3->4 got skipped entirely. This PR bumps the version to 5, and adds a migration from 4->5 such that if there are still disks in state after 4, re-run 4. This will fix things for people that upgraded to 1.0.0 and had their StateVersion updated without the migration running. I also updated the tests @danawillow wrote to start from state version 2 instead of state version 3, as the state would never be in version 3. I also duplicated those tests, but started them from state version 4 (assuming the migration hadn't run) and verifying that the migration from 4->5 would correct that."

7247,Fix failing test on storage_object_acl.,"The module test for module was failing. This is because we removed the state-setting portion of the module field from module, and due to what I can only assume is a copy/paste error, module was calling the Read function of module instead of its own when using module. Updating to use module's Read function makes the tests pass."

Sadly, this is the only way I could figure out how to get a client inside resource.TestCase, which is very sad making, but works."
7250,Deal with undeleatable bucket ACLs in storage.,"When GCS buckets are created, they're created with a set of default ACLs:  module module module  Normally, this would be fine, or a minor inconvenience. Terraform could either delete them itself, or the first apply of a user would overwrite them. However, trying to remove the module ACL yields an API error that the bucket owner must maintain OWNER access to the bucket. This breaks things like module, but also means any config without that line in it will fail to apply, not just overwrite the value. To make matters worse, trying to add the module ACL to any bucket that already has it also yields the same error about not being able to remove it. To get around this, the storage_bucket_acl resource has been updated to largely ignore just this ACL. It will not try to add it if it already exists, will not try to remove it at all. This does mean that Terraform is incapable of removing this ACL from a bucket, but I'm not sure it's possible to do that with the API, anyways. Tests were also updated to keep the default ACLs as part of the config, and to change the email addresses to addresses we actually own. I tried changing to non-existant hashicorp.com email addresses, but was rejected; only email addresses that are backed by actual Google accounts can be used, sadly."

7316,dns: Add special handling for ns records.,"Cloud DNS requires every managed zone to have an NS record at all times. This means if people want to manage their own NS records, we need to add their new record and remove the old one in the same call. It also means we can't delete NS records, as we wouldn't know what to replace it with. So deleting of NS records short-circuits. For the case of module, this prevents the error. It does mean if the user explicitly tries to remove their NS zone from their project, it silently does nothing, but that's unavoidable unless we want to A) restore a default value (and it looks like the default values change from zone to zone? And that is arguably just as unexpected?) or B) let the (arguably more reasonable) module case be impossible."
7317,storage: make bucket ACLs control the entire resource.,"Storage bucket ACLs inherited the behaviour of only updating the fields that were set in the config file. Terraform should track all the fields in the resource, whether the user has specified a value for them or not, and correct any drift that may occur. This has manifested in an issue and unexpected behaviour in #50, and this PR restores the expected behaviour."

7365,"Mark google_sql_database.{charset,collation} as computed instead of having defaults (#229)"," Mark google_sql_database.{charset,collation} as computed instead of having defaults.  This change is required to avoid the following scenario: When upgrading from a previous version of the Google provider, TF will change the charset/collation of existing (TF-managed) databases to utf8/utf8_general_ci (if the user hasn't added different config values before running TF apply), potentially overriding any non-default settings that the user my have applied through the Cloud SQL admin API. This violates POLA.   Remove charset/collation defaults from the documentation, too.   Add links to MySQL's and PostgreSQL's documentation about supported charset and collation values.   Use version 5.7's docs instead of 5.6, since that's the most up to date version of MySQL that we support.

7696,provider/google: detach disks before deleting them.,"When a module is attached to a module, deleting can be tricky. GCP doesn't allow disks that are attached to instances to be deleted. Normally, this is fine; the instance depends on the disk, so by the time the disk is deleted, the instance should already be gone. However, some reports have cropped up (#8667) that deleting disks is failing because they're still attached to instances. Though this shouldn't happen, it appears it can happen under some unknown conditions. This PR adds logic that will attempt to detach disks from any instances they're attached to before deleting the disks, adding another safeguard that should prevent this behaviour."

Migrating from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5, this would cause the config (partial) to be compared to the state (complete, as it was read from the API) and assume some policies had been explicitly deleted.

7957,Read update_strategy before overwriting it. (#11013),"As brought up in #10174, our update_strategy property for instance group managers in GCP would always be set to ""RESTART"" on read, even if the user asked for them to be ""NONE"" in the config. This adds a test to ensure that the user wishes were respected, which fails until we check for update_strategy in the ResourceData before we update it within the Read function. Because the update_strategy property doesn't map to anything in the API, we never need to read it from anywhere but the config, which means the ResourceData should be considered authoritative by the time we get to the Read function. The fix for this was provided by @JDiPierro in #10198 originally, but was missing tests, so it got squashed into this."

This seemed to be because GCE sets module to a blank string on instance creation, and if a user specifies any module in their config this is seen as the desired full contents of metadata, so we get a diff trying to remove module. Here, to address this, we just proactively remove the ""startup-script"" key from module, and then we enforce that ""metadata_startup_script"" is the only way to configure startup scripts on instances."

These weren't working well with module because it was attempting to set all unspecified params to Go's type defaults (eg. 0 for int64) which the API rejected. Changing the call to module seemed to fix this but it still didn't allow you to reset a param back to it's default by no longer specifying it. Settings defaults like this, which match the Terraform docs, seems like the best all round solution. Includes two additional tests for the acceptance tests which verify the params are really getting set correctly."
