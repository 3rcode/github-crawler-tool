By adding a logging_variant field within the node_pool_defaults, GKE users will be able to select a cluster-wide default value for the logging agent of the node pools in a cluster. For example, by specifying module every newly created node pool in the cluster will have the max throughput logging agent unless this is explicitly overridden at the node pool level (see the GKE docs for more information). GKE users will also be able to select a logging variant at the node pool level. For example, by specifying module example-node-pool-0 (as well as the default node pool) will have the default logging agent (see the GKE docs for more information), but example-node-pool-1 will have the max throughput agent.

Cloud Storage: docs improvements for automatic service account (#3903) (#7119),0.58877707,* storage: added support for autoclass in google_storage_bucket resource (#13185),"I've improved the documentation with warnings, cross-references and additional examples around appropriate use of the google_storage_project_service_account resource to ensure the proper existence of the Cloud Storage automatic internal service account prior to utilising any features which depend on the same. There are various subtleties around the lifecycle of this service account which may be non-obvious when using these features.  Moreover, the service account is always implicitly created as a side-effect of operations expected to be read-only (clicking in the UI or making a GET call to an API are sufficient). It is possible to write Terraform code which assumes the existence of the service account through interpolating the project ID into the well-known email address format and the same Terraform will work in some or many cases when the service account already exists. Such Terraform contains latent failure conditions and cannot apply cleanly to new projects. We must be defensive in these cases and ensure users are aware of the relevant data source and the importance of its use. The documentation was already good for the creation of google_storage_notification objects and the associated permissions required on pub/sub topics. I've added warnings relating to the use of the data source when specifying Cloud KMS keys on storage buckets, which did not have any hooks on the storage_bucket resource's documentation to these subtleties.

Also, add some tests for its behaviour, as well as some documentation for it. Note that this is largely an implementation of the ideas discussed in  #2118, except we're not using CustomizeDiff to reject deletions without our special flag set, because CustomizeDiff apparently doesn't run on Delete. Who knew? This leaves us rejecting the deletion at apply time, which is less than ideal, but the only other option I see is to silently not delete the resource, and that's... not ideal, either. This also stops the app_engine sub-block on google_project from forcing new when it's removed, and sets it to computed, so users can safely move from using the sub-block to using the resource without state surgery or deleting their entire project. This does mean it's impossible to delete an App Engine application from a sub-block now, but seeing as that was the same situation before, and we just papered over it by making the project recreate itself in that situation, and people Were Not Fans of that, I'm considering that an acceptable casualty.",1

Because resolveImage can return multiple formats, and only returns a self_link if a self_link is passed in, it was diffing more often than not against a self_link supplied in the config. We just had a bug in our CustomizeDiff function that concealed this. I added the resolvedImageSelfLink helper function to turn the output from resolveImage into a self_link, which fixes the problem. It also has the knock-on effect of fixing #2067 at the same time, which is nice. I decided to add another function instead of just modifying resolveImage to always return a self_link because I don't want to deal with the backwards compatibility problems of changing how we're storing a bunch of things in state this close to 1.19.0. And honestly, we should probably just be storing the self_link always, anyways.",0

Fix perma-diff on instance templates.,0.51786345,* notebooks: fixed perma-diff in google_notebooks_instance (#12493),"When using instance templates, if you use one of our image shorthands at the moment, you'll get a perma-diff. This is because the config gets resolved to another format before it is set in state, and so we need to set that other format in state. Unfortunately, resolving images requires network access, so we have to do this with CustomizeDiff. CustomizeDiff was having trouble (I think? More on this below) on setting a field as not ForceNew once the field was already set, so I moved the decision for whether a field was ForceNew or not into CustomizeDiff. I also resolved the old and new images, and if they were the same, cleared the diff. Unfortunately, you can't actually clear a field on a sub-block right now. You have to clear top-level fields only. So this will currently throw an error. I opened hashicorp/terraform#18795 to fix that. Once that's merged, and we vendor it here, this patch fixes the problem. If hashicorp/terraform#18795 doesn't get merged, the next best workaround is to keep track of all the fields under disk with a diff in our CustomizeDiff, check whether they've all changed or not, and if they've all changed, clear the changes on disk, which I think will resolve the issue. That's just a massive pain, unfortunately.",0

In order to accomplish this, the tests had to be modified to accept an emptyValue string as well which contains the content of the emptyValue string when the cidrBlocks array is empty. This maintains the old behavior of the original tests when emptyValue is an empty string, while also facilating differing behavior for the new testcase by setting emptyValue to whichever string we want to test instead. I don't think this is very clean, but I guess it's pragmatic enough. I'll hear if this is a thorn in the side to someone :smirk:. avoid panic on cidr_block type assertion This is basically the fix. Since the value can be nil, we want to ensure we handle a failure during the assertion since we know that asserting nil conforms to map[string]interface{} will cause a run-time panic. flatten to config on empty list for cidr_blocks since an empty list for cidrBlocks constitutes valid input, one should return a map containing an empty list for the cidr_blocks field instead of a nil value. The nil value is only appropriate when the input Config is also nil.",0

(#13518),"Allow using in repo configuration for cloudbuild trigger Cloudbuild triggers have a complex configuration that can be defined from the API. When using the console, the more typical way of doing this is to defined the configuration within the repository and point the configuration to the file that defines the config. This can be supported by sending the filename parameter instead of the build parameter, however only one can be sent. Acceptance testing for cloudbuild trigger with filename Ensure that when a cloudbuild repo trigger is created with a filename, that filename is what actually ends up in the cloud. Don't specify ""by default"" in cloudbuild-trigger. The docs shouldn't say that ""cloudbuild.yaml"" is used by default. There is no default from the APIs, but the console suggest using this value.

"Lions, tigers, and services being enabled with ""precondition failed"", oh my!

Additionally, I added a field filter to only return service names, which drastically reduces the size of the API call (important for slow connections, given how frequently this function is executed). Also added errwrap to better trace where errors originate. Add helper function for diffing string slices This just looked really nasty inline Batch 20 services at a time, handle precondition failed, better errwrap This commit does three things: It batches services to be enabled 20 at a time. The API fails if you try to enable more than 20 services, and this is documented in the SDK and API. I learned this the hard way. I think Terraform should ""do the right thing"" here and batch them in series' of twenty, which is what this does. Each batch is tried in serial, but I think making it parallelized is not worth the complexity tradeoffs. Handle the precondition failed error that occurs randomly. This just started happened, but it affects at least two APIs consistently, and a rudimentary test showed that it failed 78% of the time (78/100 times in an hour). We should fix this upstream, but that failure rate also necessitates (in my opinion) some mitigation on the Terraform side until a fix is in place at the API level. Use errwrap on errors for better tracing. It was really difficult to trace exactly which error was being throw. That's fixed. Updates from code review",0

If not, retry. May not always resolve #1393, but should help. Unfortunately, the real answer is probably either: For us to try and get the API updated to only return the waiter when the service will consistently be available. I don't know how feasible this is, but I'm willing to open a ticket. For us to build retries into ~all our resources to retry for a set amount of time when a service not enabled error is returned. This would greatly slow down the provider in the case of the service legitimately not being enabled, but is how other providers handle this class of problem. Unfortunately, due to the eventual consistency at play, this is a hard issue to reproduce and prove, though it matches with my experience--while testing this patch, one of the tests failed with the error that the serviceusage API hadn't been enabled, but only on step 4 of the test, when calls had already succeeded. Which suggests eventual consistency, to me. Regardless, this patch shouldn't hurt and should mostly be an imperceptible change to users, and should make instances like #1393 less likely.",0

1300 Supporting regional clusters for node pools (#1320),0.57625425,* New Resource: google_workstations_workstation_cluster (#13619),"This PR also switched us to using the beta API in all cases, and that had a side effect which is worth noting, note included here for posterity. ===== The problem is, we add a GPU, and as per the docs, GKE adds a taint to the node pool saying ""don't schedule here unless you tolerate GPUs"", which is pretty sensible. Terraform doesn't know about that, because it didn't ask for the taint to be added. So after apply, on refresh, it sees the state of the world (1 taint) and the state of the config (0 taints) and wants to set the world equal to the config. This introduces a diff, which makes the test fail - tests fail if there's a diff after they run. Taints are a beta feature, though. :) And since the config doesn't contain any taints, terraform didn't see any beta features in that node pool ... so it used to send the request to the v1 API. And since the v1 API didn't return anything about taints (since they're a beta feature), terraform happily checked the state of the world (0 taints I know about) vs the config (0 taints), and all was well. This PR makes every node pool refresh request hit the beta API. So now terraform finds out about the taints (which were always there) and the test fails (which it always should have done). The solution is probably to write a little bit of code which suppresses the report of the diff of any taint with value 'nvidia.com/gpu', but only if GPUs are enabled. I think that's something that can be done.",0

The policy currently limits the projects that images can be used from to the project running the test, but a lot of our tests use images from the debian-cloud project. This just updates the policy to allow debian-cloud images to be used, too, so even if the policy doesn't properly get cleaned up or if it runs in parallel with other tests, our tests are still within the policy. The real fix for this is to set up a separate org for testing, so we're not modifying the test environment under running tests, but that'll take a bit more time, so this is the patchfix until that can happen.",0

This might be a violation of some terraform principles. For example, testing locally with this change terraform did not recognize that indeed my infra needed to be re-deployed (from it's pov, I assume it believes this because inputs hadn't changed). Additionally, there may be valid reasons for creating an instance template with 0 gpu's that can be tuned upwards.

Unify compute_instance and compute_instance_template network_interface and service_account code This has the side effect of enabling Alias IP range support for compute_instance_templates. Add tests for compute instance template Alias IP ranges Mark instance template region as computed We compute it from the subnet its network interfaces are in. Note this is not new behaviour - I believe it was erroneously missing the computed flag. Support guest accelerators for instance templates Since most of the code is already there. Add a test for using 'address' rather than 'network_ip' for instance templates Don't mark assigned_nat_ip as deprecated Remove network_interface schema fields that don't make sense for a compute instance template Add newline after count in instance template docs Don't try to dedupe guest accelerator expansion code The API calls to Google to create guest accelerators take different values for instances and instance templates. Instance templates don't have a zone and can thus only be passed a guest accelerator name. Use ParseNetworkFieldValue instead of getNetworkLink Add support for parsing regional fields, and subnetworks specifically Currently unused because subnetworks may have a separate project from that of the instance using them, which complicates looking up the project field. Fall back to provider region when parsing regional field values Also slightly refactors getXFromSchema field helper functions for readability. Revert to assigned_nat_ip in compute instance docs Add beta scaffolding to compute instance and compute instance template Note these resources don't currently use beta features - this is futureproofing. Fix indentation in comment about instance template alias IP ranges Consolidate metadata helper functions in metadata.go Move compute instance (and template) related helpers into their own file",0

Fix compute_instance migration bug.,0.7306854,* compute: fixed bug where google_compute_instance_from_template instance defaults were overriding scheduling (#6070),"compute_instance's StateVersion was set to 2. Then we released a migration to v3, but never updated the StateVersion to 3, meaning the migration was never run. When we added the migration for disks, we bumped to 4, bypassing 3 altogher. In theory, this is fine, and is expected; after all, some people may have state in version 0 and need to upgrade all the way to 4, so our schema migration function is supposed to support this. Unfortunately, for migrations to v2, v3, and v4 of our schema, the migration returned after each migration, instead of falling through. This meant that (in this case), version 2 would see it needs to be version 4, run the state migration to version 3, then return, setting its StateVersion to 4, which means the migration from 3->4 got skipped entirely. This PR bumps the version to 5, and adds a migration from 4->5 such that if there are still disks in state after 4, re-run 4. This will fix things for people that upgraded to 1.0.0 and had their StateVersion updated without the migration running. I also updated the tests @danawillow wrote to start from state version 2 instead of state version 3, as the state would never be in version 3. I also duplicated those tests, but started them from state version 4 (assuming the migration hadn't run) and verifying that the migration from 4->5 would correct that.",1

Deal with undeleatable bucket ACLs in storage.,0.54869187,* storage: deprecated bucket_policy_only field in google_storage_bucket in favour of uniform_bucket_level_access (#7143),"When GCS buckets are created, they're created with a set of default ACLs: OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} OWNER:project-editors-{project_number} READER:project-viewers-{project_number} Normally, this would be fine, or a minor inconvenience. Terraform could either delete them itself, or the first apply of a user would overwrite them. However, trying to remove the OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} ACL yields an API error that the bucket owner must maintain OWNER access to the bucket. This breaks things like terraform destroy, but also means any config without that line in it will fail to apply, not just overwrite the value. To make matters worse, trying to add the OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} ACL to any bucket that already has it also yields the same error about not being able to remove it. To get around this, the storage_bucket_acl resource has been updated to largely ignore just this ACL. It will not try to add it if it already exists, will not try to remove it at all. This does mean that Terraform is incapable of removing this ACL from a bucket, but I'm not sure it's possible to do that with the API, anyways. Tests were also updated to keep the default ACLs as part of the config, and to change the email addresses to addresses we actually own. I tried changing to non-existant hashicorp.com email addresses, but was rejected; only email addresses that are backed by actual Google accounts can be used, sadly.",0

It also means we can't delete NS records, as we wouldn't know what to replace it with. So deleting of NS records short-circuits. For the case of terraform destroy, this prevents the error. It does mean if the user explicitly tries to remove their NS zone from their project, it silently does nothing, but that's unavoidable unless we want to A) restore a default value (and it looks like the default values change from zone to zone? And that is arguably just as unexpected?) or B) let the (arguably more reasonable) terraform destroy case be impossible.",0

GCP doesn't allow disks that are attached to instances to be deleted. Normally, this is fine; the instance depends on the disk, so by the time the disk is deleted, the instance should already be gone. However, some reports have cropped up (#8667) that deleting disks is failing because they're still attached to instances. Though this shouldn't happen, it appears it can happen under some unknown conditions. This PR adds logic that will attempt to detach disks from any instances they're attached to before deleting the disks, adding another safeguard that should prevent this behaviour.",0

Read update_strategy before overwriting it. (#11013),0.43207815,* compute: added value REFRESH to field update_policy.minimal_actioningoogle_compute_instance_group_managerandgoogle_compute_region_instance_group_manager(#11640),"As brought up in #10174, our update_strategy property for instance group managers in GCP would always be set to ""RESTART"" on read, even if the user asked for them to be ""NONE"" in the config. This adds a test to ensure that the user wishes were respected, which fails until we check for update_strategy in the ResourceData before we update it within the Read function. Because the update_strategy property doesn't map to anything in the API, we never need to read it from anywhere but the config, which means the ResourceData should be considered authoritative by the time we get to the Read function. The fix for this was provided by @JDiPierro in #10198 originally, but was missing tests, so it got squashed into this.",0

Because create_timeout is not something stored or transmitted to the API, it's not something we need a ForceNew on. Also, because an update wouldn't result in an API call, we can add a state migration to avoid a false positive diff that requires people to plan and apply but doesn't actually make an API call.",0

So setting both caused the InitializeParams property to not be initialized, then written to. Now we throw an error explaining that the configuration can't have both the disk and the type set.
