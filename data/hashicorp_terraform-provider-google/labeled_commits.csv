By adding a logging_variant field within the node_pool_defaults, GKE users will be able to select a cluster-wide default value for the logging agent of the node pools in a cluster. For example, by specifying ```terraform resource ""google_container_cluster"" ""with_logging_variant_node_pool_default"" {   name               = ""example-cluster""   location           = ""us-central1-f""   initial_node_count = 1 node_pool_defaults {     node_config_defaults {       logging_variant = ""MAX_THROUGHPUT""     }   } } ``` every newly created node pool in the cluster will have the max throughput logging agent unless this is explicitly overridden at the node pool level (see the GKE docs for more information). GKE users will also be able to select a logging variant at the node pool level. For example, by specifying ```terraform resource ""google_container_cluster"" ""with_logging_variant_node_pool_default"" {   name               = ""example-cluster""   location           = ""us-central1-f""   initial_node_count = 1 node_pool_defaults {     node_config_defaults {       logging_variant = ""DEFAULT""     }   } } resource ""google_container_node_pool"" ""with_high_throughput_logging_variant"" {   name    = ""example-node-pool-0""   cluster = google_container_cluster.with_logging_variant_node_pool_default.name } resource ""google_container_node_pool"" ""with_high_throughput_logging_variant"" {   name    = ""example-node-pool-1""   cluster = google_container_cluster.with_logging_variant_node_pool_default.name   node_config {     logging_variant = ""MAX_THROUGHPUT""   } } ``` example-node-pool-0 (as well as the default node pool) will have the default logging agent (see the GKE docs for more information), but example-node-pool-1 will have the max throughput agent.

2955,Fix deprecated convenience fields in disk.,0.5425458,* storage: fixed a bug where user specified labels get overwritten by Dataplex auto generated labels (#12694),"I've improved the documentation with warnings, cross-references and additional examples around appropriate use of the google_storage_project_service_account resource to ensure the proper existence of the Cloud Storage automatic internal service account prior to utilising any features which depend on the same. There are various subtleties around the lifecycle of this service account which may be non-obvious when using these features.  Moreover, the service account is always implicitly created as a side-effect of operations expected to be read-only (clicking in the UI or making a GET call to an API are sufficient). It is possible to write Terraform code which assumes the existence of the service account through interpolating the project ID into the well-known email address format and the same Terraform will work in some or many cases when the service account already exists. Such Terraform contains latent failure conditions and cannot apply cleanly to new projects. We must be defensive in these cases and ensure users are aware of the relevant data source and the importance of its use. The documentation was already good for the creation of google_storage_notification objects and the associated permissions required on pub/sub topics. I've added warnings relating to the use of the data source when specifying Cloud KMS keys on storage buckets, which did not have any hooks on the storage_bucket resource's documentation to these subtleties.

More context, from https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler:  Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.7, you can specify a minimum size of zero for your node pool. This allows your node pool to scale down completely if the instances within aren't required to run your workloads. However, while a node pool can scale to a zero size, the overall cluster size does not scale down to zero nodes (as at least one node is always required to run system Pods).",0

Also, add some tests for its behaviour, as well as some documentation for it. Note that this is largely an implementation of the ideas discussed in  #2118, except we're not using CustomizeDiff to reject deletions without our special flag set, because CustomizeDiff apparently doesn't run on Delete. Who knew? This leaves us rejecting the deletion at apply time, which is less than ideal, but the only other option I see is to silently not delete the resource, and that's... not ideal, either. This also stops the app_engine sub-block on google_project from forcing new when it's removed, and sets it to computed, so users can safely move from using the sub-block to using the resource without state surgery or deleting their entire project. This does mean it's impossible to delete an App Engine application from a sub-block now, but seeing as that was the same situation before, and we just papered over it by making the project recreate itself in that situation, and people Were Not Fans of that, I'm considering that an acceptable casualty.",1

Because resolveImage can return multiple formats, and only returns a self_link if a self_link is passed in, it was diffing more often than not against a self_link supplied in the config. We just had a bug in our CustomizeDiff function that concealed this. I added the resolvedImageSelfLink helper function to turn the output from resolveImage into a self_link, which fixes the problem. It also has the knock-on effect of fixing #2067 at the same time, which is nice. I decided to add another function instead of just modifying resolveImage to always return a self_link because I don't want to deal with the backwards compatibility problems of changing how we're storing a bunch of things in state this close to 1.19.0. And honestly, we should probably just be storing the self_link always, anyways.",1

This is because the config gets resolved to another format before it is set in state, and so we need to set that other format in state. Unfortunately, resolving images requires network access, so we have to do this with CustomizeDiff. CustomizeDiff was having trouble (I think? More on this below) on setting a field as not ForceNew once the field was already set, so I moved the decision for whether a field was ForceNew or not into CustomizeDiff. I also resolved the old and new images, and if they were the same, cleared the diff. Unfortunately, you can't actually clear a field on a sub-block right now. You have to clear top-level fields only. So this will currently throw an error. I opened hashicorp/terraform#18795 to fix that. Once that's merged, and we vendor it here, this patch fixes the problem. If hashicorp/terraform#18795 doesn't get merged, the next best workaround is to keep track of all the fields under disk with a diff in our CustomizeDiff, check whether they've all changed or not, and if they've all changed, clear the changes on disk, which I think will resolve the issue. That's just a massive pain, unfortunately.",1

In order to accomplish this, the tests had to be modified to accept an emptyValue string as well which contains the content of the emptyValue string when the cidrBlocks array is empty. This maintains the old behavior of the original tests when emptyValue is an empty string, while also facilating differing behavior for the new testcase by setting emptyValue to whichever string we want to test instead. I don't think this is very clean, but I guess it's pragmatic enough. I'll hear if this is a thorn in the side to someone :smirk:.  avoid panic on cidr_block type assertion  This is basically the fix. Since the value can be nil, we want to ensure we handle a failure during the assertion since we know that asserting nil conforms to map[string]interface{} will cause a run-time panic.  flatten to config on empty list for cidr_blocks  since an empty list for cidrBlocks constitutes valid input, one should return a map containing an empty list for the cidr_blocks field instead of a nil value. The nil value is only appropriate when the input Config is also nil.",0

But official images already have licenses on them, adn so Terraform is reading those as a diff. To preserve backwards compatiblity and avoid a breaking change that would require all google_compute_image users to update their configs, I've set the field to computed. This means that if no licenses are set in the config, there can be licenses in the config without prompting a diff. Obviously, this isn't ideal, as it means you can't ever remove all the licenses from an image, but I think the benefits here outweigh the drawbacks.",1

6168,"Add tests for the ""compute_image"" datasource",0.61934143,* compute: added source_image and source_snapshot to google_compute_image (#6980),"  Use errwrap to retain original error   Use built-in Page function, only return names when listing services   This removes the custom logic on pagination and uses the built-in Page function in the SDK to make things a bit simpler. Additionally, I added a field filter to only return service names, which drastically reduces the size of the API call (important for slow connections, given how frequently this function is executed). Also added errwrap to better trace where errors originate.  Add helper function for diffing string slices  This just looked really nasty inline  Batch 20 services at a time, handle precondition failed, better errwrap  This commit does three things:   It batches services to be enabled 20 at a time. The API fails if you try to enable more than 20 services, and this is documented in the SDK and API. I learned this the hard way. I think Terraform should ""do the right thing"" here and batch them in series' of twenty, which is what this does. Each batch is tried in serial, but I think making it parallelized is not worth the complexity tradeoffs.   Handle the precondition failed error that occurs randomly. This just started happened, but it affects at least two APIs consistently, and a rudimentary test showed that it failed 78% of the time (78/100 times in an hour). We should fix this upstream, but that failure rate also necessitates (in my opinion) some mitigation on the Terraform side until a fix is in place at the API level.   Use errwrap on errors for better tracing. It was really difficult to trace exactly which error was being throw. That's fixed.   Updates from code review ",0

6209,move to most recent Go 1.16 release (#11132),0.7193519,* updated to go 1.16.14 (#11132),"When enabling services, after the waiter returns, list the enabled services and ensure the ones we enabled are in there. If not, retry. May not always resolve #1393, but should help. Unfortunately, the real answer is probably either:  For us to try and get the API updated to only return the waiter when the service will consistently be available. I don't know how feasible this is, but I'm willing to open a ticket. For us to build retries into ~all our resources to retry for a set amount of time when a service not enabled error is returned. This would greatly slow down the provider in the case of the service legitimately not being enabled, but is how other providers handle this class of problem.  Unfortunately, due to the eventual consistency at play, this is a hard issue to reproduce and prove, though it matches with my experience--while testing this patch, one of the tests failed with the error that the serviceusage API hadn't been enabled, but only on step 4 of the test, when calls had already succeeded. Which suggests eventual consistency, to me. Regardless, this patch shouldn't hurt and should mostly be an imperceptible change to users, and should make instances like #1393 less likely.",1

Terraform doesn't know about that, because it didn't ask for the taint to be added. So after apply, on refresh, it sees the state of the world (1 taint) and the state of the config (0 taints) and wants to set the world equal to the config. This introduces a diff, which makes the test fail - tests fail if there's a diff after they run. Taints are a beta feature, though. :) And since the config doesn't contain any taints, terraform didn't see any beta features in that node pool ... so it used to send the request to the v1 API. And since the v1 API didn't return anything about taints (since they're a beta feature), terraform happily checked the state of the world (0 taints I know about) vs the config (0 taints), and all was well. This PR makes every node pool refresh request hit the beta API. So now terraform finds out about the taints (which were always there) and the test fails (which it always should have done). The solution is probably to write a little bit of code which suppresses the report of the diff of any taint with value 'nvidia.com/gpu', but only if GPUs are enabled. I think that's something that can be done.",0

The policy currently limits the projects that images can be used from to the project running the test, but a lot of our tests use images from the debian-cloud project. This just updates the policy to allow debian-cloud images to be used, too, so even if the policy doesn't properly get cleaned up or if it runs in parallel with other tests, our tests are still within the policy. The real fix for this is to set up a separate org for testing, so we're not modifying the test environment under running tests, but that'll take a bit more time, so this is the patchfix until that can happen.",1

Add a test for using 'address' rather than 'network_ip' for instance templates   Don't mark assigned_nat_ip as deprecated   Remove network_interface schema fields that don't make sense for a compute instance template   Add newline after count in instance template docs   Don't try to dedupe guest accelerator expansion code   The API calls to Google to create guest accelerators take different values for instances and instance templates. Instance templates don't have a zone and can thus only be passed a guest accelerator name.   Use ParseNetworkFieldValue instead of getNetworkLink   Add support for parsing regional fields, and subnetworks specifically   Currently unused because subnetworks may have a separate project from that of the instance using them, which complicates looking up the project field.  Fall back to provider region when parsing regional field values  Also slightly refactors getXFromSchema field helper functions for readability.   Revert to assigned_nat_ip in compute instance docs   Add beta scaffolding to compute instance and compute instance template   Note these resources don't currently use beta features - this is futureproofing.   Fix indentation in comment about instance template alias IP ranges   Consolidate metadata helper functions in metadata.go   Move compute instance (and template) related helpers into their own file ",0

7140,modernize firewall tests (#3839),0.58425975,* New Resource: google_compute_network_firewall_policy (#12969),"compute_instance's StateVersion was set to 2. Then we released a migration to v3, but never updated the StateVersion to 3, meaning the migration was never run. When we added the migration for disks, we bumped to 4, bypassing 3 altogher. In theory, this is fine, and is expected; after all, some people may have state in version 0 and need to upgrade all the way to 4, so our schema migration function is supposed to support this. Unfortunately, for migrations to v2, v3, and v4 of our schema, the migration returned after each migration, instead of falling through. This meant that (in this case), version 2 would see it needs to be version 4, run the state migration to version 3, then return, setting its StateVersion to 4, which means the migration from 3->4 got skipped entirely. This PR bumps the version to 5, and adds a migration from 4->5 such that if there are still disks in state after 4, re-run 4. This will fix things for people that upgraded to 1.0.0 and had their StateVersion updated without the migration running. I also updated the tests @danawillow wrote to start from state version 2 instead of state version 3, as the state would never be in version 3. I also duplicated those tests, but started them from state version 4 (assuming the migration hadn't run) and verifying that the migration from 4->5 would correct that.",0

7205,Add support for non-preemptible secondary dataproc workers (#5686) (#11230),0.7097604,* dataproc: added presto_config to dataproc_job (#11393),"When GCS buckets are created, they're created with a set of default ACLs:  OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} OWNER:project-editors-{project_number} READER:project-viewers-{project_number}  Normally, this would be fine, or a minor inconvenience. Terraform could either delete them itself, or the first apply of a user would overwrite them. However, trying to remove the OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} ACL yields an API error that the bucket owner must maintain OWNER access to the bucket. This breaks things like terraform destroy, but also means any config without that line in it will fail to apply, not just overwrite the value. To make matters worse, trying to add the OWNER:project-owners-{project_number} ACL to any bucket that already has it also yields the same error about not being able to remove it. To get around this, the storage_bucket_acl resource has been updated to largely ignore just this ACL. It will not try to add it if it already exists, will not try to remove it at all. This does mean that Terraform is incapable of removing this ACL from a bucket, but I'm not sure it's possible to do that with the API, anyways. Tests were also updated to keep the default ACLs as part of the config, and to change the email addresses to addresses we actually own. I tried changing to non-existant hashicorp.com email addresses, but was rejected; only email addresses that are backed by actual Google accounts can be used, sadly.",1

7320,Make removals in google_container_cluster (#2395),0.83983016,* containerattached: added deletion_policy field to google_container_attached_cluster resource. (#13551)," Mark google_sql_database.{charset,collation} as computed instead of having defaults.  This change is required to avoid the following scenario: When upgrading from a previous version of the Google provider, TF will change the charset/collation of existing (TF-managed) databases to utf8/utf8_general_ci (if the user hasn't added different config values before running TF apply), potentially overriding any non-default settings that the user my have applied through the Cloud SQL admin API. This violates POLA.   Remove charset/collation defaults from the documentation, too.   Add links to MySQL's and PostgreSQL's documentation about supported charset and collation values.   Use version 5.7's docs instead of 5.6, since that's the most up to date version of MySQL that we support.   Add a note that only UTF8 / en_US.UTF8 are currently supported for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL databases. ",1
