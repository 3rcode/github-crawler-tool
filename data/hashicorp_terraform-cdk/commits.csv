This comes with the challenge of having smaller sub-parts like logging, errors, config being required ""above the fold"", which is challenging with a big bundled cli package.

1535,feat(provider-generator): namespace every resource / data source / provider,"This allows reducing the compile time across all languages since users only need to import the used subset in the provider bindings instead of the entire one. Namespaces force JSII to split the generated code up into multiple files that can be individually parsed and used. BREAKING CHANGE: This changes the generated API surface a lot, if you use an already namespaced provider (read: AWS) you only need to import the provider declaration differently. For any other provider the imports are changing so that users would need to change the imports for their resources / data sources to use namespaces or barrell imports."

1791,fix(cli): Don't validate types within node_modules,Related to https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser/issues/452 which caused synth to fail. After this change TypeScript will only check types that are actually used in user code but not whether all types in dependencies are correct. We opted for this instead of pinning a version of yargs-parser without this bug because disabling this kind of checking will also help with future bugs that might occur and won't require an update of the TypeScript template. Thus this change also helps with #1991

2992,fix(cli): speed up shell autocompletions,Speed up shell autocompletions by pulling actual handler code into a separate entrypoint which is only required when it is going to be invoked. When testing this speed up shell completions by 6x (from 1.2s to 0.2s [locally on OS X]). The main reason seemed to be e.g. the React package required by e.g. ink which is deffered into a separate bundle / entrypoint now. Also module seems to have been quite a burden (used in module).

2997,feat: support set for modules and improve set support for providers,"for providers sets are exposed as lists (as they previously were) but when setting or retrieving them, the returned token will be wrapped in toset or tolist respectively. As sets are not yet supported by JSII, we will convert them to lists so that accessing individual elements works as inferred from the array type which is currently used to model sets in TypeScript. Addresses for example #424 fix(provider-generator): don't supply third arg for String|Number|Boolean Map types. remove return type to let TS narrow it down automatically to give a narrower type"

3094,fix(lib): default backend if no cross stack reference,When we have a stack that in one run uses a cross stack reference and in the other not there would be an empty local backend configuration in one cases vs the other This prevents removing a cross stack reference in case no backend is configured

For example AWS CDK Tokens were encoded as module causing more issues further down the chain in the AWS Adapter (see module package).

For string tokens we use e.g. module instead of module. Likewise for list tokens (they will become module). For number tokens we change the left part of the bitmask from module to module (which results in flipping bit 25 instead of bit 26). This change makes sure that tokens don't get accidentally resolved when e.g. a CDKTF token gets passed to an AWS CDK construct. However, it won't achieve full interoperability between the two token systems."

The other commands (e.g. module) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the module command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship."

4902,fix tests: add timeout to beforeAll hook to ensure jest waits for setup,apparently jest does not wait for an async function to complete in BeforeAll hooks (see: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9527). With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue

5781,Correct path for provider caching,
5782,Add provider to example,
5783,Generate provider version constraint from Provider resource,"Having to copy a provider file from somewhere would have been brittle again. It's easier to carry the version constraint as part of the provider resource and write it during synth. This has the benefit, that only providers which are used in the stack are actually fetched. In addition to this, it's introducing a module in the project root which gets linked into the module during synth. This allows to remove outdir, without having to init again."

5878,Complex Computed Types (#31),"This provides a fix for #12 and includes some refactoring around the resource parsing / emitting. The primary goal of the refactoring was, to split the parsing from the emitting to make it easier to understand. I'm still not quite happy with the result (in particular around the models, and that some logic is spread across multiple places). I think it needs another iteration, but for alpha it should do. Right now it's in the ""it's working"" state, and ""jsii"" will compile the ""AWS"" provider without an error. I haven't done a full sanity check of the generated resources, but for the most part it should be usable. In regards to the complex computed types, I'd see it as a first stab at the problem. It's not flexible and serves a very specific use case only. The goal:  Make complex computed types accessible Provide type information for the computed properties of those types Keep it within the constraints of jsii, namely no generics and no proxies (see #12)  A few issues were created as a follow up - see #24 #25 #26 #27 #28 #29 #39"

However, for now it's good enough   Make tests for module work   Reorganize tests, plus an integration test for GetProvider   The GetProvider integration test isn't generating the module correctly, since there's no main file for a give provider where the types can be read from.   In a few cases the module argument of the resource constructor is empty and therefore unused   Add test to github actions   Drop coverage   To make this test work properly, we'll have to fix https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-poc/issues/12   This test compiles via jsii, which complains about the attribute getters which are not properly implemented yet.  Generate an index file for each provider and ensure that class / interface names are globally unique  The uniqueness is a hack, which will be fixed once we have a solution for https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-poc/issues/13  Don't pin terraform version for github action  Co-authored-by: Anubhav Mishra link"
