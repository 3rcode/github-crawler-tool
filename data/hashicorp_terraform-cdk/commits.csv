We can simply use the @cdktf/cli package as a bundled dependency. This comes with the challenge of having smaller sub-parts like logging, errors, config being required ""above the fold"", which is challenging with a big bundled cli package. Therefore we also split out the commonly used types / functions into a @cdktf/commons package. This is sort of overdue since we keep adding little helpers left and right in the packages."

1332,fix(lib): Defer retrieving the Stack to a later time,As we moved away from instanceof we can't check for a subclass in the constructor of its own superclass. The Object.setProperty call will only be called after super finished in all base classes and this made it impossible for us to detect whether the instantiated construct was a Backend (which we use to display an additional to help users with a misconfiguration when creating a backend construct within the app and not within a stack). The stack.test.ts has a testcase for this behavior and caught this. Co-authored-by: Daniel Schmidt danielmschmidt92@gmail.com

1531,feat(provider-generator): namespace every resource / data source / provider,"This allows reducing the compile time across all languages since users only need to import the used subset in the provider bindings instead of the entire one. Namespaces force JSII to split the generated code up into multiple files that can be individually parsed and used. BREAKING CHANGE: This changes the generated API surface a lot, if you use an already namespaced provider (read: AWS) you only need to import the provider declaration differently. For any other provider the imports are changing so that users would need to change the imports for their resources / data sources to use namespaces or barrell imports."

After this change TypeScript will only check types that are actually used in user code but not whether all types in dependencies are correct. We opted for this instead of pinning a version of yargs-parser without this bug because disabling this kind of checking will also help with future bugs that might occur and won't require an update of the TypeScript template. Thus this change also helps with #1991

When testing this speed up shell completions by 6x (from 1.2s to 0.2s [locally on OS X]). The main reason seemed to be e.g. the React package required by e.g. ink which is deffered into a separate bundle / entrypoint now. Also inquirer seems to have been quite a burden (used in init).

As sets are not yet supported by JSII, we will convert them to lists so that accessing individual elements works as inferred from the array type which is currently used to model sets in TypeScript. Addresses for example #424 fix(provider-generator): don't supply third arg for String|Number|Boolean Map types. remove return type to let TS narrow it down automatically to give a narrower type"

For string tokens we use e.g. ${TFToken[1]} instead of ${Token[1]}. Likewise for list tokens (they will become #{TFToken[1]}). For number tokens we change the left part of the bitmask from 0xfbff to 0xfdff (which results in flipping bit 25 instead of bit 26). This change makes sure that tokens don't get accidentally resolved when e.g. a CDKTF token gets passed to an AWS CDK construct. However, it won't achieve full interoperability between the two token systems."

4389,feat(cli): implement watch command using a GraphQL server in a seperately spawned process,"The initial implementation of the new cdktf watch command also contains an experiment in regards to separating the underlying invocation of a synth and of Terraform for init, plan and apply from the presentation layer (which is in our case a CLI build with React components using ink). The other commands (e.g. cdktf deploy) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the watch command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship."

4897,fix PR requests. increase test timeout for python test,
4898,fix tests: add timeout to beforeAll hook to ensure jest waits for setup,apparently jest does not wait for an async function to complete in BeforeAll hooks (see: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9527). With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue

It's easier to carry the version constraint as part of the provider resource and write it during synth. This has the benefit, that only providers which are used in the stack are actually fetched.

The primary goal of the refactoring was, to split the parsing from the emitting to make it easier to understand. I'm still not quite happy with the result (in particular around the models, and that some logic is spread across multiple places). I think it needs another iteration, but for alpha it should do. Right now it's in the ""it's working"" state, and ""jsii"" will compile the ""AWS"" provider without an error. I haven't done a full sanity check of the generated resources, but for the most part it should be usable. In regards to the complex computed types, I'd see it as a first stab at the problem. It's not flexible and serves a very specific use case only. The goal:  Make complex computed types accessible Provide type information for the computed properties of those types Keep it within the constraints of jsii, namely no generics and no proxies (see #12)  A few issues were created as a follow up - see #24 #25 #26 #27 #28 #29 #39"

However, for now it's good enough   Make tests for cdktf-cli work   Reorganize tests, plus an integration test for GetProvider   The GetProvider integration test isn't generating the .jsii correctly, since there's no main file for a give provider where the types can be read from.   In a few cases the config argument of the resource constructor is empty and therefore unused   Add test to github actions   Drop coverage   To make this test work properly, we'll have to fix https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-poc/issues/12   This test compiles via jsii, which complains about the attribute getters which are not properly implemented yet.  Generate an index file for each provider and ensure that class / interface names are globally unique  The uniqueness is a hack, which will be fixed once we have a solution for https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-poc/issues/13  Don't pin terraform version for github action  Co-authored-by: Anubhav Mishra anubhavmishra@users.noreply.github.com"
