The other commands (e.g. cdktf deploy) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the watch command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship.",feat(cli): implement watch command using a GraphQL server in a seperately spawned process,"The initial implementation of the new cdktf watch command also contains an experiment in regards to separating the underlying invocation of a synth and of Terraform for init, plan and apply from the presentation layer (which is in our case a CLI build with React components using ink).

With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue,fix tests: add timeout to beforeAll hook to ensure jest waits for setup,apparently jest does not wait for an async function to complete in BeforeAll hooks (see: link).

6000,Complex Computed Types (#31),"This provides a fix for #12 and includes some refactoring around the resource parsing / emitting. The primary goal of the refactoring was, to split the parsing from the emitting to make it easier to understand. I'm still not quite happy with the result (in particular around the models, and that some logic is spread across multiple places). I think it needs another iteration, but for alpha it should do. Right now it's in the ""it's working"" state, and ""jsii"" will compile the ""AWS"" provider without an error. I haven't done a full sanity check of the generated resources, but for the most part it should be usable. In regards to the complex computed types, I'd see it as a first stab at the problem. It's not flexible and serves a very specific use case only. The goal:  Make complex computed types accessible Provide type information for the computed properties of those types Keep it within the constraints of jsii, namely no generics and no proxies (see #12)  A few issues were created as a follow up - see #24 #25 #26 #27 #28 #29 #39",Complex Computed Types (#31),"This provides a fix for #12 and includes some refactoring around the resource parsing / emitting.
