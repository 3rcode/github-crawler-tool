Namespaces force JSII to split the generated code up into multiple files that can be individually parsed and used. BREAKING CHANGE: This changes the generated API surface a lot, if you use an already namespaced provider (read: AWS) you only need to import the provider declaration differently. For any other provider the imports are changing so that users would need to change the imports for their resources / data sources to use namespaces or barrell imports.",0

After this change TypeScript will only check types that are actually used in user code but not whether all types in dependencies are correct. We opted for this instead of pinning a version of yargs-parser without this bug because disabling this kind of checking will also help with future bugs that might occur and won't require an update of the TypeScript template.

2988,fix: typos,0.8345098,chore: fix typos #927,Speed up shell autocompletions by pulling actual handler code into a separate entrypoint which is only required when it is going to be invoked. When testing this speed up shell completions by 6x (from 1.2s to 0.2s [locally on OS X]). The main reason seemed to be e.g. the React package required by e.g. ink which is deffered into a separate bundle / entrypoint now. Also inquirer seems to have been quite a burden (used in init).,1

The other commands (e.g. cdktf deploy) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the watch command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship.",1

In this process the API surface area of the constructs base package was reduced and some functionality has been moved directly to the AWS CDK instead.

With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue,0
