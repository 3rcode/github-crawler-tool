Namespaces force JSII to split the generated code up into multiple files that can be individually parsed and used. BREAKING CHANGE: This changes the generated API surface a lot, if you use an already namespaced provider (read: AWS) you only need to import the provider declaration differently. For any other provider the imports are changing so that users would need to change the imports for their resources / data sources to use namespaces or barrell imports.",0

3000,didn't mean to change version,0.5968188,// Version 0.13,Speed up shell autocompletions by pulling actual handler code into a separate entrypoint which is only required when it is going to be invoked. When testing this speed up shell completions by 6x (from 1.2s to 0.2s [locally on OS X]).

3543,Change cdktf version to 0.0.0,0.7297617,"Back in October, we announced significant performance improvements with CDKTF version 0.13. These improvements required breaking changes for which we provided backward-compatible provider bindings in version 0.13. As announced, the 0.12 (non-namespaced) provider bindings will no longer work starting with CDKTF 0.14. Refer to the upgrade guide for 0.13 to learn how to update your imports for these changes.",This missed the way the TokenMap was instantiated as a singleton which caused the two token systems to still be connected causing weird errors. For example AWS CDK Tokens were encoded as TfToken causing more issues further down the chain in the AWS Adapter (see @cdktf/aws-cdk package).,1

For string tokens we use e.g. ${TFToken[1]} instead of ${Token[1]}. Likewise for list tokens (they will become #{TFToken[1]}). For number tokens we change the left part of the bitmask from 0xfbff to 0xfdff (which results in flipping bit 25 instead of bit 26). This change makes sure that tokens don't get accidentally resolved when e.g. a CDKTF token gets passed to an AWS CDK construct. However, it won't achieve full interoperability between the two token systems.",0

4030,"Now that we have similar sounding exports, make internal function a bit clearer",0.5404823,"0.13 includes performance improvements to generated providers. Instead of exporting a flat list of exports including all supported resources and data sources, we now export each construct and it's associated structures in their own namespace. Due to this, the way you import constructs from your CDKTF application will change. For more information regarding this release, and some of the reasonings behind the changes, please check out the version 0.13 release post.",,0

Recently the constructs package was lifted to v10 with a few but major changes. The reason behind those was to make it future proof and stable across different CDKs. In this process the API surface area of the constructs base package was reduced and some functionality has been moved directly to the AWS CDK instead.

4401,Merge pull request #685 from spire-allyjweir/patch-1,0.5237869,feat(cli): support generating provider bindings in parallel #2111,"The initial implementation of the new cdktf watch command also contains an experiment in regards to separating the underlying invocation of a synth and of Terraform for init, plan and apply from the presentation layer (which is in our case a CLI build with React components using ink). The other commands (e.g. cdktf deploy) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the watch command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship.",0

With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue,0
