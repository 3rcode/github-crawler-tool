Therefore we also split out the commonly used types / functions into a @cdktf/commons package. This is sort of overdue since we keep adding little helpers left and right in the packages.",0

3660,Merge pull request #2754 from hashicorp/iterator-support-2,0.60763735,feat(cli): support generating provider bindings in parallel #2111,"To make sure CDK for Terraform tokens don't conflict with AWS CDK tokens we change the namespace of string, list and number tokens. For string tokens we use e.g. ${TFToken[1]} instead of ${Token[1]}. Likewise for list tokens (they will become #{TFToken[1]}). For number tokens we change the left part of the bitmask from 0xfbff to 0xfdff (which results in flipping bit 25 instead of bit 26). This change makes sure that tokens don't get accidentally resolved when e.g. a CDKTF token gets passed to an AWS CDK construct. However, it won't achieve full interoperability between the two token systems.",0

The other commands (e.g. cdktf deploy) which we currently have, make use of React Hooks for orchestrating the underlying steps that are required. Quite early it turned out to be unreasonable to implement the dynamic nature of the watch command using those same tools. Instead we opted for trying out a separate process and using a GraphQL api to connect the two. The main reason for this (as opposed to e.g. ProtoBuf or REST) was the superior tooling support that exists for this in TypeScript and React. However, with this prototype now in the open, we will carefully examine it and assess the pros and cons before jumping ship.",0

With the default timeout of 5 seconds this had the effect of our test cases being run without initialization to be complete. this was no issue prior as we used to use execSync which blocked the whole js main loop and thereby also blocked jest in running our test cases. switched exec to spawn for some test-helper shell calls. this allows to capture all logs and can also allow to print them as they appear (line per line) which helped discover the cause of the jest related issue,0
