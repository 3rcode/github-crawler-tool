1,ci: create proper DMG through package.json (#113)," Updated package.json to build proper DMG  electron-builder v22 -> v23 to fix builds on macOS 12.3+   Made sure to use Python3 when building for future-proofing   (Re-)Update dependencies accidentally downgraded   Fix universal macOS builds, testing fixed workflow   Remove extra x86/ARM-only builds for macOS   Update checkout@v2 -> checkout@v3   Remove Linux ia32 build because Electron isn't available for ia32 (This would prevent you from building the Linux version at all)   Clean up Linux workflow (uses new upload-artifact@v3 featuers)   Polish Linux/Windows workflows   Fix Windows workflow not publishing instaler   Update actions to Node.js 16 in publism.yml   Quick change, publish the Windows Appx builds   I seem to have forgotten a single backslash "
