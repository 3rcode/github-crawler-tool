Add ability to override access token request headers (#603),0.8719499,Add ability to override access token request headers by @JasonTolliver in link,"Add ability to override access token request headers This moves the currently hardcoded getAccessTokenResponse into their own method.  This allows children providers to construct their own headers as needed. A perfect example of the necessity of this feature is the newer Pinterest v5 API.  In order to exchange the code for an access token, they require an Authorization header composed of a base64 encoded client_id and client_secret.  Without this change, the Pinterest Provider would need to entirely reimplement the getAccessTokenResponse method.  With this change, the Pinterest Provider could simply: php protected function getTokenHeaders() {     return array_merge(         parent::getTokenHeaders(),         [             'Authorization' => 'Basic ' . base64_encode(""{$this->clientId}:{$this->clientSecret}""),         ]     ); } formatting Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",1

By changing to the new v3 url for the user info retrieval, some of the keys from the response have changed. I've added the mappings to the old keys for the raw user data so nothing should break. These can be removed in v5.0 of Socialite.",1
