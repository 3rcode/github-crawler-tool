26,Add ability to override access token request headers (#603)," Add ability to override access token request headers  This moves the currently hardcoded getAccessTokenResponse into their own method.  This allows children providers to construct their own headers as needed. A perfect example of the necessity of this feature is the newer Pinterest v5 API.  In order to exchange the code for an access token, they require an Authorization header composed of a base64 encoded client_id and client_secret.  Without this change, the Pinterest Provider would need to entirely reimplement the getAccessTokenResponse method.  With this change, the Pinterest Provider could simply: php protected function getTokenHeaders() {     return array_merge(         parent::getTokenHeaders(),         [             'Authorization' => 'Basic ' . base64_encode(""{$this->clientId}:{$this->clientSecret}""),         ]     ); }  formatting  Co-authored-by: Taylor Otwell taylor@laravel.com",Add ability to override access token request headers (#603),"Add ability to override access token request headers This moves the currently hardcoded getAccessTokenResponse into their own method.

211,Only use the read_user scope for GitLab by default,"  If the user created the application without checking any of the   scope checkboxes, GitLab will implicitly check all the boxes when   submitting the form. This can result in all scopes being granted   to the application, which is very broad.   If the user created the application with only the read_user scope   being grantable to applications, Socialite will work correctly out   of the box (without requiring the user to override the scopes being   requested on the Laravel side).
