In our case, the cluster was brand new at the time the account was created, as can be seen in the relatively low resourceVersions. Maybe it's load, maybe it's clock drift between API servers (where creationTimestamp is injected, AFAIK). No matter the cause, this is a real problem and it's stopping imports. This is the simplest fix. A more comprehensive one could also double check that the annotations for SA name and the UID on the secret match with the account's. If more than one secret matches all criteria, perhaps the oldest one could be picked. But that's all better addressed separately.",0

The provider however, did not authenticate using a service account when running inside a Kubernetes pod. This commit provides support for loading in-cluster configuration so that the provider can be used inside a Kubernetes pod (with a service account) without much additional configuration. The use-case for this is running Terraform via Atlantis inside a Kubernetes pod. But, outside of Atlantis, there may be cases where we want to run some Terraform automation inside a pod (e.g. GitLab runner).",0
