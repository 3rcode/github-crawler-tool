To support this, claim_ref is now a Computed attribute, and it will update to show the claimRef once a PVC has bound to the PV, (only now it will do so without creating a diff in terraform). Also added extra tests to catch this case and moved claim_ref's flatteners/expanders/tests into the correct files.",1

This commit adds the resources {} attribute explicitly to each regression test, which allows the StateUpgrader to run.

This commit updates the PVC resource to allow the same. A PVC's storage request may increase in-place, but the API does not allow it to decrease in place. Therefore, the provider will recreate the PVC in the case that resources.requests.storage decreases. This will shield the user from this specific Kubernetes API error: spec.resources.requests.storage: field can not be less than previous value And it provides an additional convenience by handling the delete/re-create automatically. The acceptance tests run specifically on GKE (to test a cloud provider's filesystem + block storage expansion) and on minikube (simply to test that the resources.requests.storage attribute is updated in place when needed).",1

New datasources: kubernetes_namespace & kubernetes_all_namespaces (#701),0.8119297,  - kubernetes_namespace,This change introduces a couple of new data sources for reading Kubernetes Namespace resources. kubernetes_namespace is a standard data source that exposes the attributes of a given namespace. kubernetes_all_namespaces is an enumerating data source that lists all available namespaces within a cluster. It can be used to test for the presence of a specific namespace or for applying a resource to all namespaces.,1

In our case, the cluster was brand new at the time the account was created, as can be seen in the relatively low resourceVersions. Maybe it's load, maybe it's clock drift between API servers (where creationTimestamp is injected, AFAIK). No matter the cause, this is a real problem and it's stopping imports. This is the simplest fix. A more comprehensive one could also double check that the annotations for SA name and the UID on the secret match with the account's. If more than one secret matches all criteria, perhaps the oldest one could be picked. But that's all better addressed separately.",1

The provider however, did not authenticate using a service account when running inside a Kubernetes pod. This commit provides support for loading in-cluster configuration so that the provider can be used inside a Kubernetes pod (with a service account) without much additional configuration. The use-case for this is running Terraform via Atlantis inside a Kubernetes pod. But, outside of Atlantis, there may be cases where we want to run some Terraform automation inside a pod (e.g. GitLab runner).",1
