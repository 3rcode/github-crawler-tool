This commit updates the PVC resource to allow the same. A PVC's storage request may increase in-place, but the API does not allow it to decrease in place. Therefore, the provider will recreate the PVC in the case that resources.requests.storage decreases. This will shield the user from this specific Kubernetes API error: spec.resources.requests.storage: field can not be less than previous value And it provides an additional convenience by handling the delete/re-create automatically. The acceptance tests run specifically on GKE (to test a cloud provider's filesystem + block storage expansion) and on minikube (simply to test that the resources.requests.storage attribute is updated in place when needed).",0

In our case, the cluster was brand new at the time the account was created, as can be seen in the relatively low resourceVersions. Maybe it's load, maybe it's clock drift between API servers (where creationTimestamp is injected, AFAIK). No matter the cause, this is a real problem and it's stopping imports. This is the simplest fix. A more comprehensive one could also double check that the annotations for SA name and the UID on the secret match with the account's. If more than one secret matches all criteria, perhaps the oldest one could be picked. But that's all better addressed separately.",1

The use-case for this is running Terraform via Atlantis inside a Kubernetes pod.
