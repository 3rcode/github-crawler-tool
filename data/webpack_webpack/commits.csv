However, its current implementation is such that if a call to trustedTypes.createPolicy fails, the code will immediately stop executing. This isn't necessarily desirable, as an application could be in the early phases of rolling out trusted types, and thus have the CSP rule for trusted-types LibraryA LibraryB etc, BUT have require-trusted-types-for 'script' be in ""report only"" mode (Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only). In such a configuration, and when the webpacked code is dynamically-loaded into an application, adding the policy name to the webpack config will break old versions. This PR keeps the original behavior, but introduces a new option for onPolicyCreationFailure: ""continue"" | ""stop"" (with ""stop"" remaining the default). If a developer chooses the ""continue"" option, the policy-creation will be wrapped in a try/catch. There is no security risk to this, since for host applications that DO have strict enforcement of trusted-types, the code will simply fail when the dangerous sink is used (e.g., when doing parseFromString).

1475,fix build cycle detection in Compilation,"When tracking the modules which are being built by an origin module, the code mistakenly adds the origin module itself to the set of modules it's building, instead of the actual module about to be built. As a result, when a module build finishes (and the module has itself called loadModule()), it remains marked as building itself. So if it gets loaded again, a BuildCycleError is reported despite no cycle existing.

The callback has to be popped first because the added argument is a wrapper for the original callback.

10988,Avoid calling hash.update multiple times in ConcatenatedModules,"@sokra did some profiling and it seems that calling crypto.update multiple times is slower than calling it once with a large string.  As explanation I would guess update calls into node.js C++ + OpenSSL while concatenating strings is very optimized in JIT.  To take better advantage of this information, I have rewritten this performance-sensitive code to build up a concatenated string and then hash it at the end. Since we are thinking about performance here, I opted for a regular for loop instead of using the forEach iterator. I also did some basic benchmarking of string concatenation strategies and discovered that separating out the addition of the extra space into its own concatenation line instead of tacking it on to the end of a single concatenation might just barely have the edge in terms of performance. I think it is also very readable this way, so it seems like a good tradeoff to make: a little lost conciseness for speed.",Avoid calling hash.update multiple times in ConcatenatedModules,"@sokra did some profiling and it seems that calling crypto.update multiple times is slower than calling it once with a large string. As explanation I would guess update calls into node.js C++ + OpenSSL while concatenating strings is very optimized in JIT. To take better advantage of this information, I have rewritten this performance-sensitive code to build up a concatenated string and then hash it at the end. Since we are thinking about performance here, I opted for a regular for loop instead of using the forEach iterator.

11160,Fixes #5843,,Fixes #5843,
11161,adding output.devtoolNamespace option,"When loading multiple libraries built with webpack, you can run into collisions of the sourcemap file paths. For examle, both have ""webpack:///src/index.js"". This change addresses the problem by introducing a new output option output.devtoolNamespace which defaults to output.library when not specified. The defaults moduleFilenameTemplates in all the sourcemap plugins have been modified to start with: ""webpack://[namespace]/..."", where [namespace] will be replaced by the output.devtoolNamespace. Notice that there are only two slashes following ""webpack:"" now. This is to make it behave just as before when not building with a namespace. When building with a namespace you only get the two slashes, but from what I've seen the chrome dev tools only care about the first 2 slashes anyways. Discussed with sokra here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/5767",adding output.devtoolNamespace option,"When loading multiple libraries built with webpack, you can run into collisions of the sourcemap file paths.

With this addition, you can extract all license comments to a separate file and remove them from the bundle files. A small banner points to the file containing all license information such that the user can find it if needed. We add a new option extractComments to the UglifyJsPlugin. It can be omitted, then the behavior does not change, or it can be: - true: All comments that normally would be preserved by the comments     option will be moved to a separate file. If the original file is     named foo.js, then the comments will be stored to foo.js.LICENSE - regular expression (given as RegExp or string) or a function   (astNode, comment) -> boolean: All comments that match the given     expression (resp. are evaluated to true by the function) will be     extracted to the separate file. The comments option specifies     whether the comment will be preserved, i.e. it is possible to     preserve some comments (e.g. annotations) while extracting others or     even preserving comments that have been extracted. - an object consisting of the following keys, all optional:   - condition: regular expression or function (see previous point)   - file: The file where the extracted comments will be stored. Can be       either a string (filename) or function (string) -> string which       will be given the original filename. Default is to append the       suffix .LICENSE to the original filename.   - banner: The banner text that points to the extracted file and will       be added on top of the original file. will be added to the       original file. Can be false (no banner), a string, or a function       (string) -> string that will be called with the filename where       extracted comments have been stored. Will be wrapped into comment.

14251,Fixing issue where DllPlugin + code-splits caused Webpack to end without emitting chunks.,"When utilizing code-splitting via a statement like require.ensure in addition to the DllPlugin, the webpack process would emit the Dll manifest, but not the chunks corresponding to that manifest. According to async#forEach, the callback must be called at the completion of every iteration - when utilizing code-splitting, the shortcut branch here would never call the iterator callback, which in turn meant that the emit callback never got called, causing the chunks generated by the Dll to not get emitted. Adding the completion callback results in the behavior we expect - the manifest and the chunks corresponding to that manifest both get emitted.",Fixing issue where DllPlugin + code-splits caused Webpack to end without emitting chunks.,"When utilizing code-splitting via a statement like require.ensure in addition to the DllPlugin, the webpack process would emit the Dll manifest, but not the chunks corresponding to that manifest.

14889,Fixes issue with hash length and loading external chunks,"If the length option on a hash was being used for a file path template (e.g. '[hash:8].js'), the file would be outputted with the correct name, but the reference inside require.ensure would not work, because the length truncation would operate on more than just the hash, and would truncate some of the characters added to pad the hash value. Fix is to implement the hashWithLength function where this is a problem. This doesn't feel like a proper solution, as it adds some redundancies in a few places, but it's only in the chunk loading blocks that this matters, so it's small in scope.",Fixes issue with hash length and loading external chunks,"If the length option on a hash was being used for a file path template (e.g. '[hash:8].js'), the file would be outputted with the correct name, but the reference inside require.ensure would not work, because the length truncation would operate on more than just the hash, and would truncate some of the characters added to pad the hash value.
