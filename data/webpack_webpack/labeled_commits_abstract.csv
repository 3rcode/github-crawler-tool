143,Merge pull request #12805 from webpack/dependabot/npm_and_yarn/pug-3.0.1,0.6298971,fix webpack_nonce with HMR,"Webpack already allows for specifying a trusted-types policy name. However, its current implementation is such that if a call to trustedTypes.createPolicy fails, the code will immediately stop executing. This isn't necessarily desirable, as an application could be in the early phases of rolling out trusted types, and thus have the CSP rule for trusted-types LibraryA LibraryB etc, BUT have require-trusted-types-for 'script' be in ""report only"" mode (Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only). In such a configuration, and when the webpacked code is dynamically-loaded into an application, adding the policy name to the webpack config will break old versions. This PR keeps the original behavior, but introduces a new option for onPolicyCreationFailure: ""continue"" | ""stop"" (with ""stop"" remaining the default). If a developer chooses the ""continue"" option, the policy-creation will be wrapped in a try/catch. There is no security risk to this, since for host applications that DO have strict enforcement of trusted-types, the code will simply fail when the dangerous sink is used (e.g., when doing parseFromString). And likewise, wrapping in try/catch and doing nothing on catch is OK, because the code already deals with the possibility of the trustedTypes API not being available on the browser.",0

It notes that it must store them in the code generation results because it will be cached, but that appears to be incorrect as data is a simple Map that's instantiated within the NormalModule and not captured anywhere that would be cached. As a result, configurations that use the asset/resource type and make changes to assets between cached builds will result in a runtime error as Webpack is able to access the file from cache but isn't able to access the expected values from the data object. This solution captures the data object as a property of the NormalModule and hooks in to the existing serialize/deserialize functionality in order to make this value available across cached builds.",0

As explanation I would guess update calls into node.js C++ + OpenSSL while concatenating strings is very optimized in JIT. To take better advantage of this information, I have rewritten this performance-sensitive code to build up a concatenated string and then hash it at the end. Since we are thinking about performance here, I opted for a regular for loop instead of using the forEach iterator. I also did some basic benchmarking of string concatenation strategies and discovered that separating out the addition of the extra space into its own concatenation line instead of tacking it on to the end of a single concatenation might just barely have the edge in terms of performance. I think it is also very readable this way, so it seems like a good tradeoff to make: a little lost conciseness for speed.",1

For examle, both have ""webpack:///src/index.js"". This change addresses the problem by introducing a new output option output.devtoolNamespace which defaults to output.library when not specified. The defaults moduleFilenameTemplates in all the sourcemap plugins have been modified to start with: ""webpack://[namespace]/..."", where [namespace] will be replaced by the output.devtoolNamespace. Notice that there are only two slashes following ""webpack:"" now. This is to make it behave just as before when not building with a namespace.

11395,Merge pull request #4622 from zinserjan/resolve-context,0.61232567,merge concurrent resolve request in cache,"The document say ""--watch-poll"" option can determine ""The polling interval for watching (also enable polling)"". But the previous implement only accept boolean value and no way to set the interval. This patch try to fix this problem by allow number input like this: ""--watch-poll=100"". This patch also try to keep the original behavior not be changed as much as possible. So ""--watch-poll"" and ""--watch-poll=true"" are still acceptable (enable the polling ability). But still has one incompatible change: original ""--watch-poll="" mean disable polling but after this fix it mean enable polling. It's due to yargs can not differentiate the different between ""--watch-poll"" and ""--watch-poll="" when using string type option. So no way to workaround for this problem.",0

12626,Merge pull request #13672 from webpack/cache/compression,0.66593707,merge concurrent resolve request in cache,"License comments use up a lot of space, especially when using many small libraries with large license blocks. With this addition, you can extract all license comments to a separate file and remove them from the bundle files. A small banner points to the file containing all license information such that the user can find it if needed. We add a new option extractComments to the UglifyJsPlugin. It can be omitted, then the behavior does not change, or it can be: - true: All comments that normally would be preserved by the comments     option will be moved to a separate file. If the original file is     named foo.js, then the comments will be stored to foo.js.LICENSE - regular expression (given as RegExp or string) or a function   (astNode, comment) -> boolean: All comments that match the given     expression (resp. are evaluated to true by the function) will be     extracted to the separate file. The comments option specifies     whether the comment will be preserved, i.e. it is possible to     preserve some comments (e.g. annotations) while extracting others or     even preserving comments that have been extracted. - an object consisting of the following keys, all optional:   - condition: regular expression or function (see previous point)   - file: The file where the extracted comments will be stored. Can be       either a string (filename) or function (string) -> string which       will be given the original filename. Default is to append the       suffix .LICENSE to the original filename.   - banner: The banner text that points to the extracted file and will       be added on top of the original file. will be added to the       original file. Can be false (no banner), a string, or a function       (string) -> string that will be called with the filename where       extracted comments have been stored. Will be wrapped into comment.
