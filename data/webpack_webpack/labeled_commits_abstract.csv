Add option to continue on trusted-types policy-creation failure,0.5742023,"Allow specifying ""onPolicyCreationFailure"" mode for trusted types by @Zlatkovsky in link","Webpack already allows for specifying a trusted-types policy name. However, its current implementation is such that if a call to trustedTypes.createPolicy fails, the code will immediately stop executing. This isn't necessarily desirable, as an application could be in the early phases of rolling out trusted types, and thus have the CSP rule for trusted-types LibraryA LibraryB etc, BUT have require-trusted-types-for 'script' be in ""report only"" mode (Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only). In such a configuration, and when the webpacked code is dynamically-loaded into an application, adding the policy name to the webpack config will break old versions. This PR keeps the original behavior, but introduces a new option for onPolicyCreationFailure: ""continue"" | ""stop"" (with ""stop"" remaining the default). If a developer chooses the ""continue"" option, the policy-creation will be wrapped in a try/catch. There is no security risk to this, since for host applications that DO have strict enforcement of trusted-types, the code will simply fail when the dangerous sink is used (e.g., when doing parseFromString). And likewise, wrapping in try/catch and doing nothing on catch is OK, because the code already deals with the possibility of the trustedTypes API not being available on the browser.",0

Serialize code generator data to support generated assets,0.6724664,Serialize generatedCode info to fix bug in asset module cache restoration by @ryanwilsonperkin in link,"AssetGenerator calls out in a TODO-comment that the filename, assetInfo, and fullContentHash values must be captured in the 'data' object that's populated during code generation in order to be accessible in the AssetModulesPlugin. It notes that it must store them in the code generation results because it will be cached, but that appears to be incorrect as data is a simple Map that's instantiated within the NormalModule and not captured anywhere that would be cached. As a result, configurations that use the asset/resource type and make changes to assets between cached builds will result in a runtime error as Webpack is able to access the file from cache but isn't able to access the expected values from the data object. This solution captures the data object as a property of the NormalModule and hooks in to the existing serialize/deserialize functionality in order to make this value available across cached builds.",0

Avoid calling hash.update multiple times in ConcatenatedModules,0.77971005,fix hashing with ConcatenatedModules.,"@sokra did some profiling and it seems that calling crypto.update multiple times is slower than calling it once with a large string. As explanation I would guess update calls into node.js C++ + OpenSSL while concatenating strings is very optimized in JIT. To take better advantage of this information, I have rewritten this performance-sensitive code to build up a concatenated string and then hash it at the end. Since we are thinking about performance here, I opted for a regular for loop instead of using the forEach iterator. I also did some basic benchmarking of string concatenation strategies and discovered that separating out the addition of the extra space into its own concatenation line instead of tacking it on to the end of a single concatenation might just barely have the edge in terms of performance. I think it is also very readable this way, so it seems like a good tradeoff to make: a little lost conciseness for speed.",1

Fixes #5843,0.6908171,Bugfixes:,,0
adding output.devtoolNamespace option,0.7522373,devtoolNamespace default works now also for arrays passed to output.library,"When loading multiple libraries built with webpack, you can run into collisions of the sourcemap file paths. For examle, both have ""webpack:///src/index.js"". This change addresses the problem by introducing a new output option output.devtoolNamespace which defaults to output.library when not specified. The defaults moduleFilenameTemplates in all the sourcemap plugins have been modified to start with: ""webpack://[namespace]/..."", where [namespace] will be replaced by the output.devtoolNamespace. Notice that there are only two slashes following ""webpack:"" now. This is to make it behave just as before when not building with a namespace. When building with a namespace you only get the two slashes, but from what I've seen the chrome dev tools only care about the first 2 slashes anyways. Discussed with sokra here: link",1

This patch also try to keep the original behavior not be changed as much as possible. So ""--watch-poll"" and ""--watch-poll=true"" are still acceptable (enable the polling ability). But still has one incompatible change: original ""--watch-poll="" mean disable polling but after this fix it mean enable polling. It's due to yargs can not differentiate the different between ""--watch-poll"" and ""--watch-poll="" when using string type option. So no way to workaround for this problem.",1

UglifyJsPlugin: extract comments to separate file,0.8537243,add extractComments to UglifyJsPlugin to move kept comments into separate file (i. e. LICENSE file),"License comments use up a lot of space, especially when using many small libraries with large license blocks. With this addition, you can extract all license comments to a separate file and remove them from the bundle files. A small banner points to the file containing all license information such that the user can find it if needed. We add a new option extractComments to the UglifyJsPlugin. It can be omitted, then the behavior does not change, or it can be: - true: All comments that normally would be preserved by the comments     option will be moved to a separate file. If the original file is     named foo.js, then the comments will be stored to foo.js.LICENSE - regular expression (given as RegExp or string) or a function   (astNode, comment) -> boolean: All comments that match the given     expression (resp. are evaluated to true by the function) will be     extracted to the separate file. The comments option specifies     whether the comment will be preserved, i.e. it is possible to     preserve some comments (e.g. annotations) while extracting others or     even preserving comments that have been extracted. - an object consisting of the following keys, all optional:   - condition: regular expression or function (see previous point)   - file: The file where the extracted comments will be stored. Can be       either a string (filename) or function (string) -> string which       will be given the original filename. Default is to append the       suffix .LICENSE to the original filename.   - banner: The banner text that points to the extracted file and will       be added on top of the original file. will be added to the       original file. Can be false (no banner), a string, or a function       (string) -> string that will be called with the filename where       extracted comments have been stored. Will be wrapped into comment.       Default: /! For license information please see foo.js.LICENSE /",1

According to async#forEach, the callback must be called at the completion of every iteration - when utilizing code-splitting, the shortcut branch here would never call the iterator callback, which in turn meant that the emit callback never got called, causing the chunks generated by the Dll to not get emitted. Adding the completion callback results in the behavior we expect - the manifest and the chunks corresponding to that manifest both get emitted.",1

Fixes issue with hash length and loading external chunks,0.668891,Initial chunks no longer contribute to chunkhash of runtime chunk and hashes don't occur in chunk hash map,"If the length option on a hash was being used for a file path template (e.g. '[hash:8].js'), the file would be outputted with the correct name, but the reference inside require.ensure would not work, because the length truncation would operate on more than just the hash, and would truncate some of the characters added to pad the hash value. Fix is to implement the hashWithLength function where this is a problem. This doesn't feel like a proper solution, as it adds some redundancies in a few places, but it's only in the chunk loading blocks that this matters, so it's small in scope.",0

Optional externals in amd use globals instead of an explicit dependency,0.6380792,fix usage of local AMD modules in AMD require (@chuckdumont),"There isn't any mechanism in the amdjs spec to provide optional dependancies (although a requirejs loader plugin could do that, it's not standard). The best approach found was knockout's optional dependancy on jquery, for which it doesn't use require, it only uses globals. This solution will need to be improved for use of requirejs/amd in commonjs environments, and could be toggled with a flag.",0
