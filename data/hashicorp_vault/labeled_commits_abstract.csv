To achieve this we previously utilized the enos_environment.public_ip_address attribute. Sometime in mid March we started seeing sporadic SSH i/o timeout errors when attempting to execute Enos resources against SSH transport targets. We've only ever seen this when communicating from Azure hosted runners to AWS hosted machines. While testing we were able to confirm that in some cases the public IP address resolved using DNS over UDP4 to Google and OpenDNS name servers did not match what was resolved when using the HTTPS/TCP IP address service hosted by AWS. The Enos data source was implemented in a way that we'd attempt resolution of a single name server and only attempt resolving from the next if previous name server could not get a result. We'd then allow-list that single IP address. That's a problem if we can resolve two different public IP addresses depending our endpoint address. This change utlizes the new enos_environment.public_ip_addresses attribute and subsequent behavior change. Now the data source will attempt to resolve our public IP address via name servers hosted by Google, OpenDNS, Cloudflare, and AWS. We then return a unique set of these IP addresses and allow-list all of them in our security group. It is our hope that this resolves these i/o timeout errors that seem like they're caused by the security group black-holing our attempted access because the IP we resolved does not match what we're actually exiting with.

With this change we introduce a new model for target node infrastructure. We've replaced on-demand instances for a spot fleet. While the spot price fluctuates based on dynamic pricing,  capacity, region, instance type, and platform, cost savings for our most common combinations range between 20-70%. This change only includes spot fleet targets for Vault clusters. We'll be updating our Consul backend bidding in another PR. Create a new vault_cluster module that handles installation,   configuration, initializing, and unsealing Vault clusters. Create a target_ec2_instances module that can provision a group of   instances on-demand. Create a target_ec2_spot_fleet module that can bid on a fleet of   spot instances. Extend every Enos scenario to utilize the spot fleet target acquisition   strategy and the vault_cluster module. Update our Enos CI modules to handle both the aws-nuke permissions   and also the privileges to provision spot fleets. Only use us-east-1 and us-west-2 in our scenario matrices as costs are   lower than us-west-1. Signed-off-by: Ryan Cragun me@ryan.ec",0

This resulted in an incomplete delta CRL, preventing some entries from appearing. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Correctly rebuild unified delta CRLs When deciding if the Unified Delta CRL should be rebuilt, we need to check the status of all clusters and their last revoked serial numbers. If any new serial has been revoked on any cluster, we should rebuild the unified delta CRLs. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Correctly persist Unified Delta CRL build entries When building the unified CRL, we need to read the last seen serial number from all clusters, not just the present cluster, and write it to the last built serial for that cluster's unified delta WAL entry.

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Copy delta WAL entries in event of failure Any local delta WAL should be persisted to unified delta WAL space as well.

This mostly involved creating a new variant of the unified-specific CRL builder, fetching certs from each cluster's storage space. Unlike OCSP, here we do not unify the node's local storage with the cross-cluster storage: this node is the active of the performance primary, so writes to unified storage happen exactly the same as writes to cluster-local storage, meaning the two are always in sync. Other performance secondaries do not rebuild the CRL, and hence the out-of-sync avoidance that we'd like to solve with the OCSP responder is not necessary to solve here.

We don't support revoking with private key (PoP) in the initial implementation. In particular, building on the PBPWF work, we add a special storage location for handling non-local revocations which gets replicated up to the active, primary cluster node and back down to all secondary PR clusters. These then check the pending revocation entry and revoke the serial locally if it exists, writing a cross-cluster confirmation entry. Listing capabilities are present under pki/certs/revocation-queue, allowing operators to see which certs are present. However, a future improvement to the tidy subsystem will allow automatic cleanup of stale entries. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Allow tidying revocation queue entries No manual operator control of revocation queue entries are allowed. However, entries are stored with their request time, allowing tidy to, after a suitable safety buffer, remove these unconfirmed and presumably invalid requests. Notably, when a cluster goes offline, it will be unable to process cross-cluster revocations for certificates it holds. If tidy runs, potentially valid revocations may be removed. However, it is up to the administrator to ensure the tidy window is sufficiently long that any required maintenance is done (or, prior to maintenance when an issue is first noticed, tidy is temporarily disabled). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Only allow enabling global revocation queue on Vault Enterprise Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Use a locking queue to handle revocation requests This queue attempts to guarantee that PKI's invalidateFunc won't have to wait long to execute: by locking only around access to the queue proper, and internally using a list, we minimize the time spent locked, waiting for queue accesses.

811,CHANGELOG-+,0.4999804,transform (enterprise): Fix transform configuration not handling stores parameter on the legacy path,"OpenAPI generic_mount_paths follow-up An incremental improvement within larger context discussed in #18560. Following the revert in #18617, re-introduce the change from   {mountPath} to {_mount_path}; this is needed, as   otherwise paths from multiple plugins would clash - e.g. almost every   auth method would provide a conflicting definition for   auth/{mountPath}/login, and the last one written into the map would   win. Move the half of the functionality that was in sdk/framework/ to   vault/logical_system.go with the rest; this is needed, as   sdk/framework/ gets compiled in to externally built plugins, and   therefore there may be version skew between it and the Vault main   code. Implementing the generic_mount_paths feature entirely on one   side of this boundary frees us from problems caused by this. Update the special exception that recognizes system and identity   as singleton mounts to also include the other two singleton mounts,   cubbyhole and auth/token. Include a comment that documents to restricted circumstances in which   the generic_mount_paths option makes sense to use: // Note that for this to actually be useful, you have to be using it with // a Vault instance in which you have mounted one of each secrets engine // and auth method of types you are interested in, at paths which identify // their type, and for the KV secrets engine you will probably want to // mount separate kv-v1 and kv-v2 mounts to include the documentation for // each of those APIs.

849,Protect part of emitMetrics from panic behavior during post-seal (#10708),0.8623824,metrics: Protect emitMetrics from panicking during post-seal [GH-10708],"This PR relates to a feature request logged through HashiCorp commercial support. Vault lacks pagination in its APIs. As a result, certain list operations can return very large responses.  The user's chosen audit sinks may experience difficulty consuming audit records that swell to tens of megabytes of JSON. In our case, one of the systems consuming audit log data could not cope, and failed. The responses of list operations are typically not very interesting, as they are mostly lists of keys, or, even when they include a ""key_info"" field, are not returning confidential information. They become even less interesting once HMAC-ed by the audit system. Some example Vault ""list"" operations that are prone to becoming very large in an active Vault installation are: auth/token/accessors/ identity/entity/id/ identity/entity-alias/id/ pki/certs/ In response, I've coded a new option that can be applied to audit backends, elide_list_responses. When enabled, response data is elided from audit logs, only when the operation type is ""list"". For added safety, the elision only applies to the ""keys"" and ""key_info"" fields within the response data - these are conventionally the only fields present in a list response - see logical.ListResponse, and logical.ListResponseWithInfo. However, other fields are technically possible if a plugin author writes unusual code, and these will be preserved in the audit log even with this option enabled.

This does two things: Removes ca_bundle from the hot-path of initialization after initial     migration has completed. Because this entry is seal wrapped, this     may result in performance improvements. Allows recovery of this value in the event of some other failure     with migration. Notably, this cannot occur during migration in the unlikely (and largely unsupported) case that the operator immediately downgrades to Vault <1.11.x. Thus, we reuse issuer_safety_buffer; while potentially long, tidy can always be run manually with a shorter buffer (and only this flag) to manually move the bundle if necessary. In the event of needing to recover or undo this operation, it is sufficient to use sys/raw to read the backed up value and subsequently write it to its old path (/config/ca_bundle). The new entry remains seal wrapped, but otherwise isn't used within the code and so has better performance characteristics. Performing a fat deletion (DELETE /root) will again remove the backup like the old legacy bundle, preserving its wipe characteristics.

965,Update the if conditions for test-go jobs in CI (#19809),0.5195422,activity (enterprise): Added new clients unit tests to test accuracy of estimates,"Introducing a new approach to testing Vault artifacts before merge and after merge/notorization/signing. Rather than run a few static scenarios across the artifacts, we now have the ability to run a pseudo random sample of scenarios across many different build artifacts. We've added 20 possible scenarios for the AMD64 and ARM64 binary bundles, which we've broken into five test groups. On any given push to a pull request branch, we will now choose a random test group and execute its corresponding scenarios against the resulting build artifacts. This gives us greater test coverage but lets us split the verification across many different pull requests. The post-merge release testing pipeline behaves in a similar fashion, however, the artifacts that we use for testing have been notarized and signed prior to testing. We've also reduce the number of groups so that we run more scenarios after merge to a release branch. We intend to take what we've learned building this in Github Actions and roll it into an easier to use feature that is native to Enos. Until then, we'll have to manually add scenarios to each matrix file and manually number the test group. It's important to note that Github requires every matrix to include at least one vector, so every artifact that is being tested must include a single scenario in order for all workflows to pass and thus satisfy branch merge requirements. Add support for different artifact types to enos-run Add support for different runner type to enos-run Add arm64 scenarios to build matrix Expand build matrices to include different variants Update Consul versions in Enos scenarios and matrices Refactor enos-run environment Add minimum version filtering support to enos-run.

Also switch some key locks to use DeadlockMutex to make it easier to discover deadlocks in testing. NewTestCluster also now starts the cluster, and the Start method becomes a no-op.  Unless SkipInit is provided, we also wait for a node to become active, eliminating the need for WaitForActiveNode.  This was needed because otherwise we can't safely make the quota api call.  We can't do it in Start because Start doesn't return an error, and I didn't want to begin storing the testing object T instead TestCluster just so we could call t.Fatal inside Start.  The last change here was to address the problem of how to skip setting up quotas when creating a cluster with a nonstandard handler that might not even implement the quotas endpoint.  The challenge is that because we were taking a func pointer to generate the real handler func, we didn't have any way to compare that func pointer to the standard handler-generating func http.Handler without creating a circular dependency between packages vault and http.  The solution was to pass a method instead of an anonymous func pointer so that we can do reflection on it.",0

1126,vault: Adding a barrier view,0.619822,Mount Migration: Vault supports moving secrets and auth mounts both within and across namespaces.,"Here we make the following major changes: Centralize CRT builder logic into a script utility so that we can share the   logic for building artifacts in CI or locally. Simplify the build workflow by calling a reusable workflow many times   instead of repeating the contents. Create a workflow that validates whether or not the build workflow and all   child workflows have succeeded to allow for merge protection. Motivation We need branch requirements for the build workflow and all subsequent   integration tests (QT-353) We need to ensure that the Enos local builder works (QT-558) Debugging build failures can be difficult because one has to hand craft the   steps to recreate the build Merge conflicts between Vault OSS and Vault ENT build workflows are quite   painful. As the build workflow must be the same file and name we'll reduce   what is contained in each that is unique. Implementations of building   will be unique per edition so we don't have to worry about conflict   resolution. Since we're going to be touching the build workflow to do the first two   items we might as well try and improve those other issues at the same time   to reduce the overhead of backports and conflicts. Considerations Build logic for Vault OSS and Vault ENT differs The Enos local builder was duplicating a lot of what we did in the CRT build   workflow Version and other artifact metadata has been an issue before. Debugging it   has been tedious and error prone. The build workflow is full of brittle copy and paste that is hard to   understand, especially for all of the release editions in Vault Enterprise Branch check requirements for workflows are incredibly painful to use for   workflows that are dynamic or change often. The required workflows have to be   configured in Github settings by administrators. They would also prevent us   from having simple docs PRs since required integration workflows always have   to run to satisfy branch requirements. Doormat credentials requirements that are coming will require us to modify   which event types trigger workflows. This changes those ahead of time since   we're doing so much to build workflow. The only noticeable impact will be   that the build workflow no longer runs on pushes to non-main or release   branches. In order to test other branches it requires a workflow_dispatch   from the Actions tab or a pull request. Solutions Centralize the logic that determines build metadata and creates releasable   Vault artifacts. Instead of cargo-culting logic multiple times in the build   workflow and the Enos local modules, we now have a crt-builder script which   determines build metadata and also handles building the UI, Vault, and the   package bundle. There are make targets for all of the available sub-commands.   Now what we use in the pipeline is the same thing as the local builder, and   it can be executed locally by developers. The crt-builder script works in OSS   and Enterprise so we will never have to deal with them being divergent or with   special casing things in the build workflow. Refactor the bulk of the Vault building into a reusable workflow that we can   call multiple times. This allows us to define Vault builds in a much simpler   manner and makes resolving merge conflicts much easier. Rather than trying to maintain a list and manually configure the branch check   requirements for build, we'll trigger a single workflow that uses the github   event system to determine if the build workflow (all of the sub-workflows   included) have passed. We'll then create branch restrictions on that single   workflow down the line. Signed-off-by: Ryan Cragun me@ryan.ec",0

This includes a longer safety buffer (1 year) and logging of the relevant issuer information prior to deletion (certificate contents, key ID, and issuer ID/name) to allow admins to recover this value if desired, or perform further cleanup of keys. From my PoV, removal of the issuer is thus a relatively safe operation compared to keys (which I do not feel comfortable removing) as they can always be re-imported if desired. Additionally, this is an opt-in tidy operation, not enabled by default. Lastly, most major performance penalties comes with lots of issuers within the mount, not as much large numbers of keys (as only new issuer creation/import operations are affected, unlike LIST /issuers which is a public, unauthenticated endpoint).

Due to the cluster's leadership trashing between nodes, the migration logic was re-executed several times, partially succeeding each time. While the legacy CA bundle migration logic was written with this in mind, one shortcoming in the chain building code lead us to truncate the ca_chain: by sorting the list of issuers after including non-written issuers (with random IDs), these issuers would occasionally be persisted prior to storage prior to existing CAs with modified chains. The migration code carefully imported the active issuer prior to its parents. However, due to this bug, there was a chance that, if write to the pending parent succeeded but updating the active issuer didn't, the active issuer's ca_chain field would only contain the self-reference and not the parent's reference as well. Ultimately, a workaround of setting and subsequently unsetting a manual chain would force a chain regeneration. In this patch, we simply fix the write ordering: because we need to ensure a stable chain sorting, we leave the sort location in the same place, but delay writing the provided referenceCert to the last position. This is because the reference is meant to be the user-facing action: without transactional write capabilities, other chains may succeed, but if the last user-facing action fails, the user will hopefully retry the action. This will also correct migration, by ensuring the subsequent issuer import will be attempted again, triggering another chain build and only persisting this issuer when all other issuers have also been updated. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Remigrate ca_chains to fix any missing issuers In the previous commit, we identified an issue that would occur on legacy issuer migration to the new storage format. This is easy enough to detect for any given mount (by an operator), but automating scanning and remediating all PKI mounts in large deployments might be difficult.

1191,Fix transit-key context menu on the transit-key list page (#8348),0.6540669,Transit managed keys: The transit secrets engine now supports configuring and using managed keys,"Expose raw request from client.Logical() Not all Vault API endpoints return well-formatted JSON objects. Sometimes, in the case of the PKI secrets engine, they're not even printable (/pki/ca returns a binary (DER-encoded) certificate). While this endpoint isn't authenticated, in general the API caller would either need to use Client.RawRequestWithContext(...) directly (which the docs advise against), or setup their own net/http client and re-create much of Client and/or Client.Logical. Instead, exposing the raw Request (via the new ReadRawWithData(...)) allows callers to directly consume these non-JSON endpoints like they would nearly any other endpoint. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add raw formatter for direct []byte data As mentioned in the previous commit, some API endpoints return non-JSON data. We get as far as fetching this data (via client.Logical().Read), but parsing it as an api.Secret fails (as in this case, it is non-JSON). Given that we intend to update vault read to support such endpoints, we'll need a ""raw"" formatter that accepts []byte-encoded data and simply writes it to the UI. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add support for reading raw API endpoints Some endpoints, such as pki/ca and pki/ca/pem return non-JSON objects. When calling vault read on these endpoints, an error is returned because they cannot be parsed as api.Secret instances: Error reading pki/ca/pem: invalid character '-' in numeric literal Indeed, we go to all the trouble of (successfully) fetching this value, only to be unable to Unmarshal into a Secrets value. Instead, add support for a new -format=raw option, allowing these endpoints to be consumed by callers of vault read directly.

This PR changes the tag to conform to the new standard.  We have other work queued up in crt-workflows-common and actions-docker-build to support the other required changes.  This PR should be merged to main and all release branches on or after October 20, 2022, and MUST be merged before your next production release. Otherwise, the automation to push to the RedHat registry will not work. A detailed list of changes shared from RedHat (as an FYI): The following changes will occur for container certification projects that leverage the Red Hat hosted registry [registry.connect.redhat.com] for image distribution: All currently published images are migrating to a NEW, Red Hat hosted quay registry. Partners do not have to do anything for this migration, and this will not impact customers. The registry will still utilize registry.connect.redhat.com as the registry URL. The registry URL currently used to push, tag, and certify images, as well as the registry login key, will change. You can see these changes under the “Images” tab of the container certification project. You will now see a quay.io address and will no longer see scan.connect.redhat.com. Partners will have the opportunity to auto-publish images by selecting “Auto-publish” in the Settings tab of your certification project. This will automatically publish images that pass all certification tests. For new container image projects, partners will have the option to host within their own chosen image registry while using registry.connect.redhat.com as a proxy address. This means the end user can authenticate to the Red Hat registry to pull a partner image without having to provide additional authentication to the partner’s registry. docker: update redhat_tag Co-authored-by: Sam Salisbury samsalisbury@gmail.com",0

1256,OSS parts of sighup license reload (#11767),0.58935696,license: Fix license caching issue that prevents new licenses to get picked up by the license manager [GH-10424],"The SSH secrets engine previously split the validPrincipals field on comma, then if user templating is enabled, evaluated the templates on each substring. This meant the identity template was only ever allowed to return a single principal. There are use cases where it would be helpful for identity metadata to contain a list of valid principals and for the identity template to be able to inject all of those as valid principals. This change inverts the order of processing. First the template is evaluated, and then the resulting string is split on commas. This allows the identity template to return a single comma-separated string with multiple permitted principals. There is a potential security implication here, that if a user is allowed to update their own identity metadata, they may be able to elevate privileges where previously this was not possible.

Add an extra check in intermediate/generate that validates the CSR's    signature before providing it back to the client in case we generated    a bad signature such as if an end-user used a GCP backed managed key    with a RSA PSS algorithm. GCP ignores the requested signature type and always signs with the      key's algorithm which can lead to a CSR that says it is signed with      a PKCS1v15 algorithm but is actually a RSA PSS signature Add cl PR feedback",0

In our case, mitchellh/cli helpfully adds a HelpWriter that we previously set to stderr explicitly. This writer is only called to print user-requested help text; it is not called on error cases (e.g., bad usage triggering additional help text to the user). Thus it should safely be settable to stdout, enabling pagers without additional redirects. Notably, we do have to set ErrorWriter as it defaults to initializing to the value of HelpWriter, which we want to set to stdout now, which is less useful.

This is because this SystemView access occurs outside of a request (during invalidation handling) and thus the proper lock isn't held. Because replication status cannot change within the lifetime of a plugin (and instead, if a node switches replication status, the entire plugin instance will be torn down and recreated), it is safe to cache this once, at plugin startup, and use it throughout its lifetime. Thus, we replace this SystemView access with a stored boolean variable computed ahead of time.

1561,Add transit key config to disable upserting (#18272),0.6978838,Transit managed keys: The transit secrets engine now supports configuring and using managed keys,"Allow generation of up-to-date delta CRLs While switching to periodic rebuilds of CRLs alleviates the constant rebuild pressure on Vault during times of high revocation, the CRL proper becomes stale. One response to this is to switch to OCSP, but not every system has support for this. Additionally, OCSP usually requires connectivity and isn't used to augment a pre-distributed CRL (and is instead used independently). By generating delta CRLs containing only new revocations, an existing CRL can be supplemented with newer revocations without requiring Vault to rebuild all complete CRLs. Admins can periodically fetch the delta CRL and add it to the existing CRL and applications should be able to support using serials from both. Because delta CRLs are emptied when the next complete CRL is rebuilt, it is important that applications fetch the delta CRL and correlate it to their complete CRL; if their complete CRL is older than the delta CRL's extension number, applications MUST fetch the newer complete CRL to ensure they have a correct combination. This modifies the revocation process and adds several new configuration options, controlling whether Delta CRLs are enabled and when we'll rebuild it.

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Skip CRL building steps when disabled This skips a number of steps during CRL build when it is disabled (and forceNew is not set). In particular, we avoid fetching issuers, we avoid associating issuers with revocation entries (and building that in-memory mapping), making CRL building more efficient. This means that there'll again be very little overhead on clusters with the CRL disabled. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Prevent revoking roots from appearing on own CRLs This change ensures that when marking a root as revoked, it no longer appears on its own CRL. Very few clients support this event (as generally only leaves/intermediates are checked for presence on a parent's CRL) and it is technically undefined behavior (if the root is revoked, its own CRL should be untrusted and thus including it on its own CRL isn't a safe/correct distribution channel). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Ensure stability of revInfo issuer identification As mentioned by Kit, iterating through each revInfoEntry and associating the first issuer which matches it can cause churn when many (equivalent) issuers are in the system and issuers come and go (via CRLSigning usage, which has been modified in this release as well). Because we'd not include issuers without CRLSigning usage, we'd cause our verification helper, isRevInfoIssuerValid, to think the issuer ID is no longer value (when instead, it just lacks crlSigning bits). We address this by pulling in all issuers we know of for the identification. This allows us to keep valid-but-not-for-signing issuers, and use other representatives of their identity set for signing/building the CRL (if they are enabled for such usage).

This allows callers to revoke certificate they own (as proven by holding the corresponding private key), without having an admin create innumerable ACLs around the serial_number parameter for every issuance/user. We base this on Go TLS stack's verification of certificate<->key matching, but extend it where applicable to ensure curves match, the private key is indeed valid, and has the same structure as the corresponding public key from the certificate.

In particular, Vault verifies the signature on the certificate from an existing issuer within the mount, ensuring that one indeed issued this certificate. The certificate is then added to storage and its serial submitted for revocation. This allows certificates generated with no_store=true to be submitted for revocation afterwards, given a full copy of the certificate.

In particular, OpenSSL appears to be unique in requiring a SKID/AKID match for chain building. If AKID and SKID are present on an otherwise valid client/parent cert pair and the values are different, OpenSSL will not build a valid path over those two, whereas most other chain validation implementations will. Regardless, to have proper cross-signing support, we really aught to support copying an SKID. This adds such support to the sign-intermediate endpoint. Support for the /issue endpoint is not added, as cross-signing leaf certs isn't generally useful and can accept random SKIDs.

Can stop Agent from attempting to delete the file, which is useful in k8s where the service account JWT is mounted as a read-only file and so any attempt to delete it generates spammy error logs. When leaving the JWT file in place, the read period for new tokens is 1 minute instead of 500ms to reflect the assumption that there will always be a file there, so finding a file does not provide any signal that it needs to be re-read. Kubernetes has a minimum TTL of 10 minutes for tokens, so a period of 1 minute gives Agent plenty of time to detect new tokens, without leaving it too unresponsive.

Operators can restrict roles to just a single option (e.g., for email certs, limit CNs to have strictly email addresses and not hostnames). By setting the value to disabled, CNs of other formats can be accepted without validating their contents against our minimal correctness checks for email/hostname/wildcard that we typically apply even when broad permissions (allow_any_name=true, enforce_hostnames=false, and allow_wildcard_certificates=true) are granted on the role.

[GH-10546],"Fix handling of username_as_alias during LDAP authentication There is a bug that was introduced in the LDAP authentication method by link. It was thought to be backward compatible but has broken a number of users. Later a new parameter username_as_alias was introduced in link to make it possible for operators to restore the previous behavior. The way it is currently working is not completely backward compatible thought because when username_as_alias is set, a call to GetUserAliasAttributeValue() will first be made, then this value is completely discarded in pathLogin() and replaced by the username as expected. This is an issue because it makes useless calls to the LDAP server and will break backward compatibility if one of the constraints in GetUserAliasAttributeValue() is not respected, even though the resulting value will be discarded anyway. In order to maintain backward compatibility here we have to only call GetUserAliasAttributeValue() if necessary. Since this change of behavior was introduced in 1.9, this fix will need to be backported to the 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches.

This roughly matches the existing expectations from /config/ca (wherein a chain could be provided) and /intemediate/set-signed (where a chain may be provided). However, in both of those cases, we simply accepted a chain. Here, we need to be able to reconstruct the chain from parts on disk. However, with potential rotation of roots, we need to be aware of disparate chains. Simply concating together all issuers isn't sufficient. Thus we need to be able to parse a certificate's Issuer and Subject field and reconstruct valid (and potentially parallel) parent<->child mappings. This attempts to handle roots, intermediates, cross-signed intermediates, cross-signed roots, and rotated keys (wherein one might not have a valid signature due to changed key material with the same subject).

For certain constructed CAs, this fails since pkix.Name is not suitable for round-tripping. This also builds a CRLv1 (per RFC 5280) CRL. In updating to the newer x509.CreateRevocationList(...) call, we can construct the CRL in the CRLv2 format and correctly copy the issuer's name. However, this requires holding an additional field per-CRL, the CRLNumber field, which is required in Go's implementation of CRLv2 (though OPTIONAL in the spec).

In the event of issuing an intermediate, this behavior was ignored, instead permitting the issuance. Users generally do not think to check their issuer's NotAfter date when requesting a certificate; thus this behavior was generally surprising. Per RFC 5280 however, issuers need to maintain status information throughout the life cycle of the issued cert. If this leaf cert were to be issued for a longer duration than the parent issuer, the CA must still maintain revocation information past its expiration. Thus, we add an option to the issuer to change the desired behavior: err, to err out, permit, to permit the longer NotAfter date, or truncate, to silently truncate the expiration to the issuer's    NotAfter date. Since expiration of certificates in the system's trust store are not generally validated (when validating an arbitrary leaf, e.g., during TLS validation), permit should generally only be used in that case. However, browsers usually validate intermediate's validity periods, and thus truncate should likely be used (as with permit, the leaf's chain will not validate towards the end of the issuance period).

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Address PKI to properly support managed keys (#15256) Address codebase for managed key fixes Add proper public key comparison for better managed key support to importKeys Remove redundant public key fetching within PKI importKeys Correctly handle rebuilding remaining chains When deleting a specific issuer, we might impact the chains. From a consistency perspective, we need to ensure the remaining chains are correct and don't refer to the since-deleted issuer, so trigger a full rebuild here. We don't need to call this in the delete-the-world (DELETE /root) code path, as there shouldn't be any remaining issuers or chains to build. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Remove legacy CRL bundle on world deletion When calling DELETE /root, we should remove the legacy CRL bundle, since we're deleting the legacy CA issuer bundle as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Remove deleted issuers' CRL entries Since CRLs are no longer resolvable after deletion (due to missing issuer ID, which will cause resolution to fail regardless of if an ID or a name/default reference was used), we should delete these CRLs from storage to avoid leaking them. In the event that this issuer comes back (with key material), we can simply rebuild the CRL at that time (from the remaining revoked storage entries). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add unauthed JSON fetching of CRLs, Issuers (#15253) Default to fetching JSON CRL for consistency This makes the bare issuer-specific CRL fetching endpoint return the JSON-wrapped CRL by default, moving the DER CRL to a specific endpoint. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add JSON-specific endpoint for fetching issuers Unlike the unqualified /issuer/:ref endpoint (which also returns JSON), we have a separate /issuer/:ref/json endpoint to return only the PEM-encoded certificate and the chain, mirroring the existing /cert/ca endpoint but for a specific issuer. This allows us to make the endpoint unauthenticated, whereas the bare endpoint would remain authenticated and usually privileged. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add tests for raw JSON endpoints Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add unauthenticated issuers endpoints to PKI table This adds the unauthenticated issuers endpoints? LIST /issuers, Fetching just the issuer certificates (in JSON/DER/PEM form), and Fetching the CRL of this issuer (in JSON/DER/PEM form). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add issuer usage restrictions bitset This allows issuers to have usage restrictions, limiting whether they can be used to issue certificates or if they can generate CRLs. This allows certain issuers to not generate a CRL (if the global config is with the CRL enabled) or allows the issuer to not issue new certificates (but potentially letting the CRL generation continue). Setting both fields to false effectively forms a soft delete capability.

We default (both on migration and new role creation) to the less secure true value for backwards compatibility with existing Vault versions. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Refactor sanitizedName to reducedName Per comment, this variable name was confusing during the reproduction and subsequent fix of the earlier vulnerability and associated bug report. Because the common name isn't necessarily sanitized in any way (and indeed must be considered in relation to other parts or the whole), but portions of the entire name are removed, reducedName appears to make the most sense. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Enforce AllowWildcardCertificates during issuance This commit adds the bulk of correctly validating wildcard certificate Common Names during issuance according to RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 semantics. As part of this, support for RFC 2818-conforming wildcard certificates (wherein there are almost no restrictions on issuance) has been removed. Note that this flag does take precedence over AllowAnyName, giving a little more safety in wildcard issuance in this case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Update test cases to conform with RFC 6125 Test cases 19, 70+71, and 83+84 didn't conform with the RFC 6125, and so should've been rejected under strict conformance. For 70+71 and 83+84, we previously conditioned around the value of AllowSubdomains (allowing issuance when true), but they likely should've been rejected either way. Additionally, update the notes about globs matching wildcard certificates to notate this is indeed the case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Check AllowWildcardCertifciates in issuance tests This allows for regression tests to cover the new AllowWildcardCertificate conditional. We add additional test cases ensuring that wildcard issuance is properly forbidden in all relevant scenarios, while allowing the existing test cases to validate that wildcard status doesn't affect non-wildcard certificates.

2584,Support reading Vault's address from Agent's config file (#6306),0.64595735,agent: The agent/v1/quit endpoint can now be used to stop the Vault Agent remotely [GH-14223],"Allow issuance of wildcard via glob match From Vault v1.8.0 onwards, we would incorrectly disallow issuance of a wildcard certificate when allow_glob_domain was enabled with a multi-part glob domain in allowed_domains (such as ..foo) when attempting to issue a wildcard for a subdomain (such as .bar.foo). This fixes that by reverting an errant change in the case insensitivity patch. Here, when validating against a very powerful glob construct, we leave the wildcard prefix (.) from the raw common_name element, to allow multi-part globs to match wildcard entries. It is important to note that ""sanitizedName"" is an incorrect variable naming here. Wildcard parsing (per RFC 6125 which supercedes RFC 2818) must be in the left-most segment of the domain, but we lack validation to ensure no internal wildcards exist. Additionally per item 3 of section 6.4.3 of RFC 6125, wildcards MAY be internal to a domain segment, in which case sanitizedName again leaves the wildcard in place.

Per RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.13, application/pkix-crl is only appropriate when the CRL is in DER form. Likewise, Section 4.2.2.1 states that application/pkix-cert is only applicable when a single DER certificate is used. Per recommendation in RFC 8555 (""ACME""), Section 7.4.2 and 9.1, we use the newer application/pem-certificate-chain media type for certificates. However, this is not applicable for CRLs, so we use fall back to application/x-pem-file for these. Notably, no official IETF source is present for the latter. On the OpenSSL PKI tutorial (link), this type is cited as coming from S/MIME's predecessor, PEM, but neither of the main PEM RFCs (RFC 934, 1421, 1422, 1423, or 1424) mention this type.

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Ensure minimum of 2048-bit PKI RSA keys While the stated path is a false-positive, verifying all paths is non-trivial. We largely validate API call lengths using certutil.ValidateKeyTypeLength(...), but ensuring no other path calls certutil.generatePrivateKey(...) --- directly or indirectly --- is non-trivial. Thus enforcing a minimum in this method sounds like a sane compromise. Resolves: link Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com",0

These endpoints offer identical   functionality and are basically aliases. This is the only functional   change in the PR except for terms in error messages. Replace ""whitelist"" -> ""access list"", ""blacklist"" -> ""deny list"" in   variable names, comments, etc. Note that storage locations were not changed at this time, as that is a more complex process involving versioning that we may tackle in a future revision.

For specific concurrent executions the grabLockOrStop function can return stopped=true when the lock is still held. A comment in grabLockOrStop indicates that the function is only used when the stateLock is held, but grabLockOrStop is being used to acquire the stateLock. If there are concurrent goroutines using grabLockOrStop then some concurrent executions result in stopped=true being returned when the lock is acquired. The fix is to add a lock and some state around which the parent and child goroutine in the grabLockOrStop function can coordinate so that the different concurrent executions can be handled. This change includes a non-deterministic unit test which reliably reproduces the problem before the fix. use rand instead of time for random test stopCh close Using time.Now().UnixNano()%2 ends up being system dependent because different operating systems and hardware have different clock resolution. A lower resolution will return the same unix time for a longer period of time. It is better to avoid this issue by using a random number generator. This change uses the rand package default random number generator. It's generally good to avoid using the default random number generator, because it creates extra lock contention. For a test it should be fine.",0

[GH-16274],"Vault uses http.ServeMux which issues an HTTP 301 redirect if the request path contains a double slash (//). Additionally, vault handles all paths to ensure that the path only contains printable characters. Therefore use the same validation on the to/from parameters for remounting. Not doing this can result in a Vault mount that was originally mounted at pki/foo to being remounted at pki/foo//bar resulting in mounts that cannot be accessed.

These verify that you can't verify something signed using JWS marshaling when claiming it's ASN1, and vice versa.  The problem is that we rely on unmarshaling failing, and it doesn't always.  Both encodings use base64, one with padding, one without, so depending on the data sometimes unmarshaling will work when we expect it to fail.  It would be nice to preserve these tests if they could be made reliable, but I didn't see an easy way, and I don't think they add enough value to warrant greater effort. Restore the tests I removed, and improve the verify function to broaden the notion of errExpected. Co-authored-by: Vishal Nayak vishalnayak@users.noreply.github.com",0

6401,Fix link for the tutorial about Key Management Secrets Engine with GCP Cloud KMS (#19418),0.8741299,Key Management Secrets Engine (Enterprise): Adds support for distributing and managing keys in GCP Cloud KMS.,"secret/aws: Pass policy ARNs to AssumedRole and FederationToken roles AWS now allows you to pass policy ARNs as well as, and in addition to, policy documents for AssumeRole and GetFederationToken (see link/). Vault already collects policy ARNs for iam_user credential types; now it will allow policy ARNs for assumed_role and federation_token credential types and plumb them through to the appropriate AWS calls. This brings along a minor breaking change. Vault roles of the federation_token credential type are now required to have either a policy_document or a policy_arns specified. This was implicit previously; a missing policy_document would result in a validation error from the AWS SDK when retrieving credentials. However, it would still allow creating a role that didn't have a policy_document specified and then later specifying it, after which retrieving the AWS credentials would work. Similar workflows in which the Vault role didn't have a policy_document specified for some period of time, such as deleting the policy_document and then later adding it back, would also have worked previously but will now be broken. The reason for this breaking change is because a credential_type of federation_token without either a policy_document or policy_arns specified will return credentials that have equivalent permissions to the credentials the Vault server itself is using. This is quite dangerous (e.g., it could allow Vault clients access to retrieve credentials that could modify Vault's underlying storage) and so should be discouraged. This scenario is still possible when passing in an appropriate policy_document or policy_arns parameter, but clients should be explicitly aware of what they are doing and opt in to it by passing in the appropriate role parameters. Error out on dangerous federation token retrieval The AWS secrets role code now disallows creation of a dangerous role configuration; however, pre-existing roles could have existed that would trigger this now-dangerous code path, so also adding a check for this configuration at credential retrieval time.

This is necessary so that we can list the sys bucket, get a list of all child keys, and then trim this down to find child 'folders' eg food. Right now however, we store the full value of every storage entry in all three buckets. This is unnecessary as the value will only ever be read out in the leaf bucket ie sys/foo/bar. We use the intermediary buckets simply for listing keys. We have seen some issues around compaction where certain buckets, particularly intermediary buckets that are exclusively for listing, get really clogged up with data to the point of not being listable. Buckets like sys/expire/id are huge, combining lease expiry data for all auth methods, and need to be listed for vault to successfully become leader. This PR tries to cut down on the amount of data stored in intermediary buckets. Avoid goroutine leak by buffering results channel up to the bucket count",0

First, some code that previously lived in enterprise has moved here: this includes some helper code for manipulating clusters and for building storage backends.  Second, the existing cluster-building code using inmem storage has been generalized to allow various storage backends. Third, added support for creating two-cluster DR setups. Finally, there are tweaks to handle edge cases that result in intermittent failures, or to eliminate sleeps in favour of polling to detect state changes. Also: generalize TestClusterOptions.PhysicalFactory so it can be used either as a per-core factory (for raft) or a per-cluster factory (for other storage backends.)",0

Error handling for functions therefore often ends up always treating errors as either user related or internal. When the error is logical.ErrReadOnly this means that treating errors as user errors skips the check that triggers forwarding, instead returning a read only view error to the user. While it's obviously more correct to fix that code, it's not always immediately apparent to reviewers or fixers what the issue is and fixing it when it's found both requires someone to hit the problem and report it (thus exposing bugs to users) and selective targeted refactoring that only helps that one specific case. If instead we check whether the logical.Response is an error and, if so, whether it contains the error value, we work around this in all of these cases automatically. It feels hacky since it's a coding mistake, but it's one we've made too multiple times, and avoiding bugs altogether is better for our users.",0

This meant you could then create a duplicate mount using the same path which would then not conflict in the router until postUnseal.

This negates the double negative, making the devx a bit easier to follow. Check return value of UnsealWithStoredKeys in sys/init Return proper error types when attempting unseal with stored key Prior to this commit, ""nil"" could have meant unsupported auto-unseal, a transient error, or success. This updates the function to return the correct error type, signaling to the caller whether they should retry or fail. Continuously attempt to unseal if sealed keys are supported This fixes a bug that occurs on bootstrapping an initial cluster. Given a collection of Vault nodes and an initialized storage backend, they will all go into standby waiting for initialization. After one node is initialized, the other nodes had no mechanism by which they ""re-check"" to see if unseal keys are present. This adds a goroutine to the server command which continually waits for unseal keys to exist. It exits in the following conditions: the node is unsealed the node does not support stored keys a fatal error occurs (as defined by Vault) the server is shutting down In all other situations, the routine wakes up at the specified interval and attempts to unseal with the stored keys.",0

Key lookups are a different API method not covered by roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter. This means users must grant an extended scope to their service account (granting the ability to read key data) which only seems to be used to validate the existence of the key. Worse, the only roles that include this permission are overly verbose (e.g. roles/viewer which gives readonly access to everything in the project and roles/cloudkms.admin which gives full control over all key operations). This leaves the user stuck between choosing to create a custom IAM role (which isn't fun) or grant overly broad permissions. By changing to an encrypt call, we get better verification of the unseal permissions and users can reduce scope to a single role.",0

However, because the user never existed, the rollback failed. Thus, the WAL would essentially get ""stuck"" and Vault would continually attempt to roll it back, failing every time. A similar situation could arise if the IAM user that Vault created got deleted out of band, or if Vault deleted it but was unable to write the lease revocation back to storage (e.g., a storage failure). This attempts to harden it in two ways. One is by deleting the WAL log entry if the IAM user creation fails. However, the WAL deletion could still fail, and this wouldn't help where the user is deleted out of band, so second, consider the user rolled back if the user just doesn't exist, under certain circumstances. Fixes #5190 Fix segfault in expiration unit tests TestExpiration_Tidy was passing in a leaseEntry that had a nil Secret, which then caused a segfault as the changes to revokeEntry didn't check whether Secret was nil; this is probably unlikely to occur in real life, but good to be extra cautious.

9002,doc updates,0.5340409,ui: update DocLink component to use new host url: developer.hashicorp.com [GH-18374],Allow vault ssh to accept ssh commands in any ssh compatible format Previously vault ssh required ssh commands to be in the format username@hostname  command. While this works just fine for human users this breaks a lot of automation workflows and is not compatible with the options that the ssh client supports. Motivation We currently run ansible which uses vault ssh to connect to hosts. Ansible generates ssh commands with the format ssh  -o User=username hostname command. While this is a valid ssh command it currently breaks with vault because vault expects the format to be username@hostname. To work around this we currently use a wrapper script to parse the correct username being set by ansible and translate this into a vault ssh compatible username@hostname format Changes You can now specify arguments in any order that ssh client allows. All arguments are passed directly to the ssh command and the format isn't modified in any way. The username and port are parsed from the specified ssh command. It will accept all of the options supported by the ssh command and also will properly prefer -p and user@ if both options are specified. The ssh port is only added from the vault credentials if it hasn't been specified on the command line,0

This could make it difficult to perform after-the-fact analysis based on both the initial response entry and further requests. Now, the full set of applicable policies from both the token and any derived policies from Identity are reported. To keep things consistent, token authentications now also return the full set of policies in api.Secret.Auth responses, so this both makes it easier for users to understand their actual full set, and it matches what the audit logs now report.",1

[GH-19194]","Remove a lot of deferred functions in the request path. There is an interesting benchmark at link/ It shows that defer actually adds quite a lot of overhead -- maybe 100ns per call but we defer a lot of functions in the request path. So this removes some of the ones in request handling, ha, barrier, router, and physical cache. One meta-note: nearly every metrics function is in a defer which means every metrics call we add could add a non-trivial amount of time, e.g. for every 10 extra metrics statements we add 1ms to a request. I don't know how to solve this right now without doing what I did in some of these cases and putting that call into a simple function call that then goes before each return.

The changes are (in diff order): A CurrentWrappingLookupFunc has been added to return the current value. This is necessary for the lookahead call since we don't want the lookahead call to be wrapped. Support for unwrapping < 0.6.2 tokens via the API/CLI has been removed, because we now have backends returning 404s with data and can't rely on the 404 trick. These can still be read manually via cubbyhole/response. KV preflight version request now ensures that its calls is not wrapped, and restores any given function after. When responding with a raw body, instead of always base64-decoding a string value and erroring on failure, on failure we assume that it simply wasn't a base64-encoded value and use it as is. A test that fails on master and works now that ensures that raw body responses that are wrapped and then unwrapped return the expected values. A flag for response data that indicates to the wrapping handling that the data contained therein is already JSON decoded (more later). RespondWithStatusCode now defaults to a string so that the value is HMAC'd during audit. The function always JSON encodes the body, so before now it was always returning []byte which would skip HMACing. We don't know what's in the data, so this is a ""better safe than sorry"" issue. If different behavior is needed, backends can always manually populate the data instead of relying on the helper function. We now check unwrapped data after unwrapping to see if there were raw flags. If so, we try to detect whether the value can be unbase64'd. The reason is that if it can it was probably originally a []byte and shouldn't be audit HMAC'd; if not, it was probably originally a string and should be. In either case, we then set the value as the raw body and hit the flag indicating that it's already been JSON decoded so not to try again before auditing. Doing it this way ensures the right typing. There is now a check to see if the data coming from unwrapping is already JSON decoded and if so the decoding is skipped before setting the audit response.",0

9791,Fix retryable dep,0.5975621,storage/raft: Fix retry_join initialization failure [GH-16550],"Accept temp creds in AWS secret backend acceptance tests The AWS secret backend acceptance tests implicitly accepted long-lived AWS credentials (i.e., AWS IAM user and/or root credentials) in two ways: It expected credentials to be passed in via the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables. By not accepting    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN or AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN, temporary credentials could    not be passed in. (This also forced all credentials to be passed in    via environment variables, which is a bit ugly). The AWS sts:GetFederationToken call is only allowed from long-term    credentials. This is called by the Vault code which the acceptance    tests exercise. 1 is solved by deleting explicit references to credentials, which allows the SDK to do one of the things it does best -- find credentials via the default chain. 2 is a little more complicated. Rather than pass in whatever creds the acceptance test was run under to the backend, the acceptance test now creates a new IAM user and gets an access key from it, then passes the IAM user's creds back to the backend so that it can call sts:GetFederationToken (and then tries to clean up afterwards). Fix Travis build failure The Travis build was failing because the user creation was happening regardless of whether it was running in acceptance test mode or not. This moves the user creation into the acceptance test precheck, which requires lazily evaluating the credentials when configuring the backend in the STS accetpance test, and so moving that to a PreFlight closure. Reduce blind sleeps in AWS secret backend acceptance tests This removes a blind ""sleep 10 seconds and then attempt to reuse the credential"" codepath and instead just keeps attemtping to reuse the credential for 10 seconds and fails if there aren't any successful uses after 10 seconds. This adds a few seconds speedup of acceptance test runs from my experiments.",0

On get, to avoid the performance hit of always lowercasing when not necessary since it's in the critical path, we have a minor optimization -- we check the LRU first before normalizing.

10938,"Remove enable/disable and make deletion_allowed a configurable property. On read, return the version and creation time of each key",0.5119716,secrets/transform (enterprise): Fix persistence problem with rotated tokenization key versions,"The current implementation of the SSH command is heavily tied to the assumptions of OTP/dynamic key types. The SSH CA backend is fundamentally a different approach to login and authentication. As a result, there was some restructuring of existing methods to share more code and state. Each authentication method (ca, otp, dynamic) are now fully-contained in their own handle* function. -mode and -role are going to be required for SSH CA, and I don't think the magical UX (and overhead) of guessing them is a good UX. It's confusing as to which role and how Vault guesses. We can reduce 66% of the API calls and add more declaration to the CLI by making -mode and -role required. This commit adds warnings for that deprecation, but these values are both required for CA type authentication. The principal and extensions are currently fixed, and I personally believe that's good enough for the first pass at this. Until we understand what configuration options users will want, I think we should ship with all the local extensions enabled. Users who don't want that can generate the key themselves directly (current behavior) or submit PRs to make the map of extensions customizable. Host key checking for the CA backend is not currently implemented. It's not strictly required at setup, so I need to think about whether it belongs here. This is not ready for merge, but it's ready for early review.",0

This is incorrect if you consider the fact    that deleteing nested node can leave empty prefixes/dirs behind which have    neither children nor data inside. The fix changes this situation by testing    if the node has any data set - if not then it is not a leaf.  * zookeeper does not delete nodes that do not have childern just like consul    does and this leads to leaving empty nodes behind.

[GH-10456]","In some situations, it can be impossible to revoke leases (for instance, if someone has gone and manually removed users created by Vault). This can not only cause Vault to cycle trying to revoke them, but it also prevents mounts from being unmounted, leaving them in a tainted state where the only operations allowed are to revoke (or rollback), which will never successfully complete. This adds a new endpoint that works similarly to revoke-prefix but ignores errors coming from a backend upon revocation (it does not ignore errors coming from within the expiration manager, such as errors accessing the data store). This can be used to force Vault to abandon leases. Like revoke-prefix, this is a very sensitive operation and requires sudo. It is implemented as a separate endpoint, rather than an argument to revoke-prefix, to ensure that control can be delegated appropriately, as even most administrators should not normally have this privilege.
