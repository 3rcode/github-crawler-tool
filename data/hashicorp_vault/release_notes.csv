CHANGES:

core: Bump Go version to 1.20.3.

IMPROVEMENTS:

Add debug symbols back to builds to fix Dynatrace support [GH-20294]
cli/namespace: Add detailed flag to output additional namespace information 
such as namespace IDs and custom metadata. [GH-20243]
core/activity: add an endpoint to write test activity log data, guarded by a build flag [GH-20019]
core: Add a raft sub-field to the storage and ha_storage details provided by the
/sys/config/state/sanitized endpoint in order to include the max_entry_size. [GH-20044]
core: include reason for ErrReadOnly on PBPWF writing failures
sdk/ldaputil: added connection_timeout to tune connection timeout duration 
for all LDAP plugins. [GH-20144]
secrets/pki: Decrease size and improve compatibility of OCSP responses by removing issuer certificate. [GH-20201]
sys/wrapping: Add example how to unwrap without authentication in Vault [GH-20109]
ui: Allows license-banners to be dismissed. Saves preferences in localStorage. [GH-19116]

BUG FIXES:

auth/ldap: Add max_page_size configurable to LDAP configuration [GH-19032]
command/server: Fix incorrect paths in generated config for -dev-tls flag on Windows [GH-20257]
core (enterprise): Fix intermittent issue with token entries sometimes not being found when using a newly created token in a request to a secondary, even when SSCT new_token forwarding is set. When this occurred, this would result in the following error to the client: error performing token check: no lease entry found for token that ought to have one, possible eventual consistency issue.
core (enterprise): Fix read on perf standbys failing with 412 after leadership change, unseal, restores or restarts when no writes occur
core/seal: Fix handling of HMACing of seal-wrapped storage entries from HSMs using CKM_AES_CBC or CKM_AES_CBC_PAD.
core/ssct (enterprise): Fixed race condition where a newly promoted DR may revert sscGenCounter 
resulting in 412 errors.
core: Fix regression breaking non-raft clusters whose nodes share the same cluster_addr/api_addr. [GH-19721]
helper/random: Fix race condition in string generator helper [GH-19875]
kmip (enterprise): Fix a problem decrypting with keys that have no Process Start Date attribute.
pki: Fix automatically turning off CRL signing on upgrade to Vault >= 1.12, if CA Key Usage disallows it [GH-20220]
replication (enterprise): Fix a caching issue when replicating filtered data to
a performance secondary. This resulted in the data being set to nil in the cache
and a ""invalid value"" error being returned from the API.
replication (enterprise): Fix replication status for Primary clusters showing its primary cluster's information (in case of DR) in secondaries field when known_secondaries field is nil
sdk/helper/ocsp: Workaround bug in Go's ocsp.ParseResponse(...), causing validation to fail with embedded CA certificates.
auth/cert: Fix OCSP validation against Vault's PKI engine. [GH-20181]
secrets/aws: Revert changes that removed the lease on STS credentials, while leaving the new ttl field in place. [GH-20034]
secrets/pki: Ensure cross-cluster delta WAL write failure only logs to avoid unattended forwarding. [GH-20057]
secrets/pki: Fix building of unified delta CRLs and recovery during unified delta WAL write failures. [GH-20058]
secrets/pki: Fix patching of leaf_not_after_behavior on issuers. [GH-20341]
secrets/transform (enterprise): Address SQL connection leak when cleaning expired tokens
ui: Fix OIDC provider logo showing when domain doesn't match [GH-20263]
ui: Fix bad link to namespace when namespace name includes . [GH-19799]
ui: fixes browser console formatting for help command output [GH-20064]
ui: fixes remaining doc links to include /vault in path [GH-20070]

SECURITY:

secrets/ssh: removal of the deprecated dynamic keys mode. When any remaining dynamic key leases expire, an error stating secret is unsupported by this backend will be thrown by the lease manager. [GH-18874]

CHANGES:

auth/alicloud: require the role field on login [GH-19005]
auth/approle: Add maximum length of 4096 for approle role_names, as this value results in HMAC calculation [GH-17768]
auth: Returns invalid credentials for ldap, userpass and approle when wrong credentials are provided for existent users.
This will only be used internally for implementing user lockout. [GH-17104]
core: Bump Go version to 1.20.1.
core: Vault version has been moved out of sdk and into main vault module.
Plugins using sdk/useragent.String must instead use sdk/useragent.PluginString. [GH-14229]
logging: Removed legacy environment variable for log format ('LOGXI_FORMAT'), should use 'VAULT_LOG_FORMAT' instead [GH-17822]
plugins: Mounts can no longer be pinned to a specific builtin version. Mounts previously pinned to a specific builtin version will now automatically upgrade to the latest builtin version, and may now be overridden if an unversioned plugin of the same name and type is registered. Mounts using plugin versions without builtin in their metadata remain unaffected. [GH-18051]
plugins: GET /database/config/:name endpoint now returns an additional plugin_version field in the response data. [GH-16982]
plugins: GET /sys/auth/:path/tune and GET /sys/mounts/:path/tune endpoints may now return an additional plugin_version field in the response data if set. [GH-17167]

brute force attacks for userpass, approle and ldap auth methods. [GH-19230]
VMSS Flex Authentication: Adds support for Virtual Machine Scale Set Flex Authentication [GH-19077]
Namespaces (enterprise): Added the ability to allow access to secrets and more to be shared across namespaces that do not share a namespace hierarchy. Using the new sys/config/group-policy-application API, policies can be configured to apply outside of namespace hierarchy, allowing this kind of cross-namespace sharing.
OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client Libraries (Beta): We have now made available two new OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client libraries (beta). You can use them to perform various secret management operations easily from your applications.

","1.13.0
March 01, 2023
SECURITY:
secrets/ssh: removal of the deprecated dynamic keys mode. When any remaining dynamic key leases expire, an error stating secret is unsupported by this backend will be thrown by the lease manager. [GH-18874]
CHANGES:
auth/alicloud: require the role field on login [GH-19005]
auth/approle: Add maximum length of 4096 for approle role_names, as this value results in HMAC calculation [GH-17768]
auth: Returns invalid credentials for ldap, userpass and approle when wrong credentials are provided for existent users.
This will only be used internally for implementing user lockout. [GH-17104]
core: Bump Go version to 1.20.1.
core: Vault version has been moved out of sdk and into main vault module.
Plugins using sdk/useragent.String must instead use sdk/useragent.PluginString. [GH-14229]
logging: Removed legacy environment variable for log format ('LOGXI_FORMAT'), should use 'VAULT_LOG_FORMAT' instead [GH-17822]
plugins: Mounts can no longer be pinned to a specific builtin version. Mounts previously pinned to a specific builtin version will now automatically upgrade to the latest builtin version, and may now be overridden if an unversioned plugin of the same name and type is registered. Mounts using plugin versions without builtin in their metadata remain unaffected. [GH-18051]
plugins: GET /database/config/:name endpoint now returns an additional plugin_version field in the response data. [GH-16982]
plugins: GET /sys/auth/:path/tune and GET /sys/mounts/:path/tune endpoints may now return an additional plugin_version field in the response data if set. [GH-17167]

brute force attacks for userpass, approle and ldap auth methods. [GH-19230]
VMSS Flex Authentication: Adds support for Virtual Machine Scale Set Flex Authentication [GH-19077]
Namespaces (enterprise): Added the ability to allow access to secrets and more to be shared across namespaces that do not share a namespace hierarchy. Using the new sys/config/group-policy-application API, policies can be configured to apply outside of namespace hierarchy, allowing this kind of cross-namespace sharing.
OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client Libraries (Beta): We have now made available two new OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client libraries (beta). You can use them to perform various secret management operations easily from your applications. 
IMPROVEMENTS:
