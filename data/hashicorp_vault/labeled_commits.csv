Revocation of a certificate via proving possession of its private     key, using this private key to create the JWS signature.  We do not support the third mechanism, completing challenges equivalent to those on the existing certificate and then performing a revocation under an account which didn't issue the certificate but which did solve those challenges. We additionally create another map account->cert->order, allowing us to quickly look up if a cert was issued by this particular account.

[GH-12802],"The security groups that allow access to remote machines in Enos scenarios have been configured to only allow port 22 (SSH) from the public IP address of machine executing the Enos scenario. To achieve this we previously utilized the enos_environment.public_ip_address attribute. Sometime in mid March we started seeing sporadic SSH i/o timeout errors when attempting to execute Enos resources against SSH transport targets. We've only ever seen this when communicating from Azure hosted runners to AWS hosted machines. While testing we were able to confirm that in some cases the public IP address resolved using DNS over UDP4 to Google and OpenDNS name servers did not match what was resolved when using the HTTPS/TCP IP address service hosted by AWS. The Enos data source was implemented in a way that we'd attempt resolution of a single name server and only attempt resolving from the next if previous name server could not get a result. We'd then allow-list that single IP address. That's a problem if we can resolve two different public IP addresses depending our endpoint address. This change utlizes the new enos_environment.public_ip_addresses attribute and subsequent behavior change. Now the data source will attempt to resolve our public IP address via name servers hosted by Google, OpenDNS, Cloudflare, and AWS. We then return a unique set of these IP addresses and allow-list all of them in our security group. It is our hope that this resolves these i/o timeout errors that seem like they're caused by the security group black-holing our attempted access because the IP we resolved does not match what we're actually exiting with.

As documented in the Go issue, this is not a valid assumption and thus causes OCSP verification to fail in Vault with an error like:  bad OCSP signature: crypto/rsa: verification error  which ultimately leads to a cert auth login error of:  no chain matching all constraints could be found for this login certificate  We address this by using the unsafe issuer=nil argument, taking on the task of validating the OCSP response's signature as best we can in the absence of full chain information on either side (both the trusted certificate whose OCSP response we're verifying and the lack of any additional certs the OCSP responder may have sent).

This resulted in an incomplete delta CRL, preventing some entries from appearing. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Correctly rebuild unified delta CRLs  When deciding if the Unified Delta CRL should be rebuilt, we need to check the status of all clusters and their last revoked serial numbers. If any new serial has been revoked on any cluster, we should rebuild the unified delta CRLs. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Correctly persist Unified Delta CRL build entries  When building the unified CRL, we need to read the last seen serial number from all clusters, not just the present cluster, and write it to the last built serial for that cluster's unified delta WAL entry. This prevents us from continuously rebuilding unified CRLs now that we have fixed our rebuild heuristic. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix getLastWALSerial for unified delta CRLs  getLastWALSerial ignored its path argument, preventing it from reading the specified cluster-specific WAL entry. On the primary cluster, this was mostly equivalent, but now that we're correctly reading WAL entries and revocations for other clusters, we need to handle reading these entries correctly. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Copy delta WAL entries in event of failure  Any local delta WAL should be persisted to unified delta WAL space as well. If such unified persistence fails, we need to ensure that they get eventually moved up, otherwise they'll remain missing until the next full CRL rebuild occurs, which might be significantly longer than when the next delta CRL rebuild would otherwise occur. runUnifiedTransfer already handles this for us, but it lacked logic for delta WAL serials. The only interesting catch here is that we refuse to copy any entries whose full unified revocation entry has not also been written. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Make doUnifiedTransferMissingLocalSerials log an error  This message is mostly an error and would always be helpful information to have when troubleshooting failures. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Warn on cross-cluster write failures during revoke  When revoking certificates, we log cross-cluster revocation failures, but we should really expose this information to the caller, that their local revocation was successful, but their cross-cluster revocation failed. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Ensure unified delta WAL entry has full entry  Delta WAL entries are empty files whose only information (a revoked serial number) is contained in the file path. These depend implicitly on a full revocation entry existing for this file (whether a cross-cluster unified entry or a local entry). We should not write unified delta WAL entries without the corresponding full unified revocation entry existing. Add a warning in this case.

This mostly involved creating a new variant of the unified-specific CRL builder, fetching certs from each cluster's storage space. Unlike OCSP, here we do not unify the node's local storage with the cross-cluster storage: this node is the active of the performance primary, so writes to unified storage happen exactly the same as writes to cluster-local storage, meaning the two are always in sync. Other performance secondaries do not rebuild the CRL, and hence the out-of-sync avoidance that we'd like to solve with the OCSP responder is not necessary to solve here. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add ability to fetch unified CRLs  This adds to the path-fetch APIs the ability to return the unified CRLs. We update the If-Modified-Since infrastructure to support querying the unified CRL specific data and fetchCertBySerial to support all unified variants.

Notably, this commit also changes us to not write Delta WALs when Delta CRLs is disabled (versus previously doing it when auto rebuild is enabled in case Delta CRLs were later asked for), and instead, triggering rebuilding a complete CRL so we don't need up-to-date Delta WAL info.

We don't support revoking with private key (PoP) in the initial implementation. In particular, building on the PBPWF work, we add a special storage location for handling non-local revocations which gets replicated up to the active, primary cluster node and back down to all secondary PR clusters. These then check the pending revocation entry and revoke the serial locally if it exists, writing a cross-cluster confirmation entry. Listing capabilities are present under pki/certs/revocation-queue, allowing operators to see which certs are present. However, a future improvement to the tidy subsystem will allow automatic cleanup of stale entries. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow tidying revocation queue entries  No manual operator control of revocation queue entries are allowed. However, entries are stored with their request time, allowing tidy to, after a suitable safety buffer, remove these unconfirmed and presumably invalid requests. Notably, when a cluster goes offline, it will be unable to process cross-cluster revocations for certificates it holds. If tidy runs, potentially valid revocations may be removed. However, it is up to the administrator to ensure the tidy window is sufficiently long that any required maintenance is done (or, prior to maintenance when an issue is first noticed, tidy is temporarily disabled).

715,Bump sdk in api,0.52101,core: Bump Go version to 1.19.8.," OpenAPI generic_mount_paths follow-up  An incremental improvement within larger context discussed in #18560.   Following the revert in #18617, re-introduce the change from   {mountPath} to {<path-of-mount>_mount_path}; this is needed, as   otherwise paths from multiple plugins would clash - e.g. almost every   auth method would provide a conflicting definition for   auth/{mountPath}/login, and the last one written into the map would   win.   Move the half of the functionality that was in sdk/framework/ to   vault/logical_system.go with the rest; this is needed, as   sdk/framework/ gets compiled in to externally built plugins, and   therefore there may be version skew between it and the Vault main   code. Implementing the generic_mount_paths feature entirely on one   side of this boundary frees us from problems caused by this.   Update the special exception that recognizes system and identity   as singleton mounts to also include the other two singleton mounts,   cubbyhole and auth/token.   Include a comment that documents to restricted circumstances in which   the generic_mount_paths option makes sense to use: // Note that for this to actually be useful, you have to be using it with // a Vault instance in which you have mounted one of each secrets engine // and auth method of types you are interested in, at paths which identify // their type, and for the KV secrets engine you will probably want to // mount separate kv-v1 and kv-v2 mounts to include the documentation for // each of those APIs.

753,Vault SSH: Removing script file,0.5850687,secrets/ssh: Allow removing SSH host keys from the dynamic keys feature. [GH-18939],"This PR relates to a feature request logged through HashiCorp commercial support. Vault lacks pagination in its APIs. As a result, certain list operations can return very large responses.  The user's chosen audit sinks may experience difficulty consuming audit records that swell to tens of megabytes of JSON. In our case, one of the systems consuming audit log data could not cope, and failed. The responses of list operations are typically not very interesting, as they are mostly lists of keys, or, even when they include a ""key_info"" field, are not returning confidential information. They become even less interesting once HMAC-ed by the audit system. Some example Vault ""list"" operations that are prone to becoming very large in an active Vault installation are: auth/token/accessors/ identity/entity/id/ identity/entity-alias/id/ pki/certs/  In response, I've coded a new option that can be applied to audit backends, elide_list_responses. When enabled, response data is elided from audit logs, only when the operation type is ""list"". For added safety, the elision only applies to the ""keys"" and ""key_info"" fields within the response data - these are conventionally the only fields present in a list response - see logical.ListResponse, and logical.ListResponseWithInfo. However, other fields are technically possible if a plugin author writes unusual code, and these will be preserved in the audit log even with this option enabled. The elision replaces the values of the ""keys"" and ""key_info"" fields with an integer count of the number of entries. This allows even the elided audit logs to still be useful for answering questions like ""Was any data returned?"" or ""How many records were listed?"".",0

[GH-11408]," Allow tidy to backup legacy CA bundles  With the new tidy_move_legacy_ca_bundle option, we'll use tidy to move the legacy CA bundle from /config/ca_bundle to /config/ca_bundle.bak. This does two things:  Removes ca_bundle from the hot-path of initialization after initial     migration has completed. Because this entry is seal wrapped, this     may result in performance improvements. Allows recovery of this value in the event of some other failure     with migration.  Notably, this cannot occur during migration in the unlikely (and largely unsupported) case that the operator immediately downgrades to Vault <1.11.x. Thus, we reuse issuer_safety_buffer; while potentially long, tidy can always be run manually with a shorter buffer (and only this flag) to manually move the bundle if necessary. In the event of needing to recover or undo this operation, it is sufficient to use sys/raw to read the backed up value and subsequently write it to its old path (/config/ca_bundle). The new entry remains seal wrapped, but otherwise isn't used within the code and so has better performance characteristics. Performing a fat deletion (DELETE /root) will again remove the backup like the old legacy bundle, preserving its wipe characteristics.

869,"remove noisy log, simplify job interface (#10975)",0.5635914,core (enterprise): Fix a data race in logshipper.,"Introducing a new approach to testing Vault artifacts before merge and after merge/notorization/signing. Rather than run a few static scenarios across the artifacts, we now have the ability to run a pseudo random sample of scenarios across many different build artifacts. We've added 20 possible scenarios for the AMD64 and ARM64 binary bundles, which we've broken into five test groups. On any given push to a pull request branch, we will now choose a random test group and execute its corresponding scenarios against the resulting build artifacts. This gives us greater test coverage but lets us split the verification across many different pull requests. The post-merge release testing pipeline behaves in a similar fashion, however, the artifacts that we use for testing have been notarized and signed prior to testing. We've also reduce the number of groups so that we run more scenarios after merge to a release branch. We intend to take what we've learned building this in Github Actions and roll it into an easier to use feature that is native to Enos. Until then, we'll have to manually add scenarios to each matrix file and manually number the test group. It's important to note that Github requires every matrix to include at least one vector, so every artifact that is being tested must include a single scenario in order for all workflows to pass and thus satisfy branch merge requirements.  Add support for different artifact types to enos-run Add support for different runner type to enos-run Add arm64 scenarios to build matrix Expand build matrices to include different variants Update Consul versions in Enos scenarios and matrices Refactor enos-run environment Add minimum version filtering support to enos-run.

By extending /config/urls and its issuer counterpart to include an enable_templating parameter, we can allow operators to correctly identify the particular cluster a cert was issued on, and tie its AIA information to this (cluster, issuer) pair dynamically. Notably, this does not solve all usage issues around AIA URIs: the CRL and OCSP responder remain local, meaning that some merge capability is required prior to passing it to other systems if they use CRL files and must validate requests with certs from any arbitrary PR cluster.

Also switch some key locks to use DeadlockMutex to make it easier to discover deadlocks in testing. NewTestCluster also now starts the cluster, and the Start method becomes a no-op.  Unless SkipInit is provided, we also wait for a node to become active, eliminating the need for WaitForActiveNode.  This was needed because otherwise we can't safely make the quota api call.  We can't do it in Start because Start doesn't return an error, and I didn't want to begin storing the testing object T instead TestCluster just so we could call t.Fatal inside Start.  The last change here was to address the problem of how to skip setting up quotas when creating a cluster with a nonstandard handler that might not even implement the quotas endpoint.  The challenge is that because we were taking a func pointer to generate the real handler func, we didn't have any way to compare that func pointer to the standard handler-generating func http.Handler without creating a circular dependency between packages vault and http.  The solution was to pass a method instead of an anonymous func pointer so that we can do reflection on it.",0

Simplify the build workflow by calling a reusable workflow many times   instead of repeating the contents. Create a workflow that validates whether or not the build workflow and all   child workflows have succeeded to allow for merge protection.  Motivation  We need branch requirements for the build workflow and all subsequent   integration tests (QT-353) We need to ensure that the Enos local builder works (QT-558) Debugging build failures can be difficult because one has to hand craft the   steps to recreate the build Merge conflicts between Vault OSS and Vault ENT build workflows are quite   painful. As the build workflow must be the same file and name we'll reduce   what is contained in each that is unique. Implementations of building   will be unique per edition so we don't have to worry about conflict   resolution. Since we're going to be touching the build workflow to do the first two   items we might as well try and improve those other issues at the same time   to reduce the overhead of backports and conflicts.  Considerations  Build logic for Vault OSS and Vault ENT differs The Enos local builder was duplicating a lot of what we did in the CRT build   workflow Version and other artifact metadata has been an issue before. Debugging it   has been tedious and error prone. The build workflow is full of brittle copy and paste that is hard to   understand, especially for all of the release editions in Vault Enterprise Branch check requirements for workflows are incredibly painful to use for   workflows that are dynamic or change often. The required workflows have to be   configured in Github settings by administrators. They would also prevent us   from having simple docs PRs since required integration workflows always have   to run to satisfy branch requirements. Doormat credentials requirements that are coming will require us to modify   which event types trigger workflows. This changes those ahead of time since   we're doing so much to build workflow. The only noticeable impact will be   that the build workflow no longer runs on pushes to non-main or release   branches. In order to test other branches it requires a workflow_dispatch   from the Actions tab or a pull request.  Solutions  Centralize the logic that determines build metadata and creates releasable   Vault artifacts. Instead of cargo-culting logic multiple times in the build   workflow and the Enos local modules, we now have a crt-builder script which   determines build metadata and also handles building the UI, Vault, and the   package bundle. There are make targets for all of the available sub-commands.   Now what we use in the pipeline is the same thing as the local builder, and   it can be executed locally by developers. The crt-builder script works in OSS   and Enterprise so we will never have to deal with them being divergent or with   special casing things in the build workflow. Refactor the bulk of the Vault building into a reusable workflow that we can   call multiple times. This allows us to define Vault builds in a much simpler   manner and makes resolving merge conflicts much easier. Rather than trying to maintain a list and manually configure the branch check   requirements for build, we'll trigger a single workflow that uses the github   event system to determine if the build workflow (all of the sub-workflows   included) have passed. We'll then create branch restrictions on that single   workflow down the line.  Signed-off-by: Ryan Cragun me@ryan.ec",1

[GH-15054]," Add automatic tidy of expired issuers  To aid PKI users like Consul, which periodically rotate intermediates, and provided a little more consistency with older versions of Vault which would silently (and dangerously!) replace the configured CA on root/intermediate generation, we introduce an automatic tidy of expired issuers. This includes a longer safety buffer (1 year) and logging of the relevant issuer information prior to deletion (certificate contents, key ID, and issuer ID/name) to allow admins to recover this value if desired, or perform further cleanup of keys. From my PoV, removal of the issuer is thus a relatively safe operation compared to keys (which I do not feel comfortable removing) as they can always be re-imported if desired. Additionally, this is an opt-in tidy operation, not enabled by default. Lastly, most major performance penalties comes with lots of issuers within the mount, not as much large numbers of keys (as only new issuer creation/import operations are affected, unlike LIST /issuers which is a public, unauthenticated endpoint).

1068,Set c.standby true in non-HA context. (#2259),0.53469765,"core (enterprise): ""vault status"" command works when a namespace is set. [GH-10725]"," Ensure correct write ordering in rebuildIssuersChains  When troubleshooting a recent migration failure from 1.10->1.11, it was noted that some PKI mounts had bad chain construction despite having valid, chaining issuers. Due to the cluster's leadership trashing between nodes, the migration logic was re-executed several times, partially succeeding each time. While the legacy CA bundle migration logic was written with this in mind, one shortcoming in the chain building code lead us to truncate the ca_chain: by sorting the list of issuers after including non-written issuers (with random IDs), these issuers would occasionally be persisted prior to storage prior to existing CAs with modified chains. The migration code carefully imported the active issuer prior to its parents. However, due to this bug, there was a chance that, if write to the pending parent succeeded but updating the active issuer didn't, the active issuer's ca_chain field would only contain the self-reference and not the parent's reference as well. Ultimately, a workaround of setting and subsequently unsetting a manual chain would force a chain regeneration. In this patch, we simply fix the write ordering: because we need to ensure a stable chain sorting, we leave the sort location in the same place, but delay writing the provided referenceCert to the last position. This is because the reference is meant to be the user-facing action: without transactional write capabilities, other chains may succeed, but if the last user-facing action fails, the user will hopefully retry the action. This will also correct migration, by ensuring the subsequent issuer import will be attempted again, triggering another chain build and only persisting this issuer when all other issuers have also been updated. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remigrate ca_chains to fix any missing issuers  In the previous commit, we identified an issue that would occur on legacy issuer migration to the new storage format. This is easy enough to detect for any given mount (by an operator), but automating scanning and remediating all PKI mounts in large deployments might be difficult. Write a new storage migration version to regenerate all chains on upgrade, once.

We get as far as fetching this data (via client.Logical().Read), but parsing it as an api.Secret fails (as in this case, it is non-JSON). Given that we intend to update vault read to support such endpoints, we'll need a ""raw"" formatter that accepts []byte-encoded data and simply writes it to the UI. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add support for reading raw API endpoints  Some endpoints, such as pki/ca and pki/ca/pem return non-JSON objects. When calling vault read on these endpoints, an error is returned because they cannot be parsed as api.Secret instances:  Error reading pki/ca/pem: invalid character '-' in numeric literal  Indeed, we go to all the trouble of (successfully) fetching this value, only to be unable to Unmarshal into a Secrets value. Instead, add support for a new -format=raw option, allowing these endpoints to be consumed by callers of vault read directly.

[GH-17070]," [CI-only] Update RedHat registry tag  There are a few changes being made to RedHat's registry on October 20, 2022 that affect the way images need to be tagged prior to being pushed to the registry. This PR changes the tag to conform to the new standard.  We have other work queued up in crt-workflows-common and actions-docker-build to support the other required changes.  This PR should be merged to main and all release branches on or after October 20, 2022, and MUST be merged before your next production release. Otherwise, the automation to push to the RedHat registry will not work.  A detailed list of changes shared from RedHat (as an FYI): The following changes will occur for container certification projects that leverage the Red Hat hosted registry [registry.connect.redhat.com] for image distribution:   All currently published images are migrating to a NEW, Red Hat hosted quay registry. Partners do not have to do anything for this migration, and this will not impact customers. The registry will still utilize registry.connect.redhat.com as the registry URL.   The registry URL currently used to push, tag, and certify images, as well as the registry login key, will change. You can see these changes under the “Images” tab of the container certification project. You will now see a quay.io address and will no longer see scan.connect.redhat.com.   Partners will have the opportunity to auto-publish images by selecting “Auto-publish” in the Settings tab of your certification project. This will automatically publish images that pass all certification tests.   For new container image projects, partners will have the option to host within their own chosen image registry while using registry.connect.redhat.com as a proxy address. This means the end user can authenticate to the Red Hat registry to pull a partner image without having to provide additional authentication to the partner’s registry.   docker: update redhat_tag   Co-authored-by: Sam Salisbury samsalisbury@gmail.com",0

This meant the identity template was only ever allowed to return a single principal. There are use cases where it would be helpful for identity metadata to contain a list of valid principals and for the identity template to be able to inject all of those as valid principals. This change inverts the order of processing. First the template is evaluated, and then the resulting string is split on commas. This allows the identity template to return a single comma-separated string with multiple permitted principals. There is a potential security implication here, that if a user is allowed to update their own identity metadata, they may be able to elevate privileges where previously this was not possible.

This behavior would allow unauthenticated," Write explicit -help output to stdout  Per the consensus of most programs, and mirroring the GNU Coding Standards for CLI design, when users request -help explicitly via the CLI, this should be written to stdout to allow paging of output. stderr is fine when an invalid usage triggers the help text however. In our case, mitchellh/cli helpfully adds a HelpWriter that we previously set to stderr explicitly. This writer is only called to print user-requested help text; it is not called on error cases (e.g., bad usage triggering additional help text to the user). Thus it should safely be settable to stdout, enabling pagers without additional redirects. Notably, we do have to set ErrorWriter as it defaults to initializing to the value of HelpWriter, which we want to set to stdout now, which is less useful.

However, if the user tries to mount a versioned plugin with the same name as a builtin, and specifies the non-builtin version be used, we return an error.

[GH-18031]," Don't race for CRL rebuilding capability check  Core has recently seen some data races during SystemView/replication updates between them and the PKI subsystem. This is because this SystemView access occurs outside of a request (during invalidation handling) and thus the proper lock isn't held. Because replication status cannot change within the lifetime of a plugin (and instead, if a node switches replication status, the entire plugin instance will be torn down and recreated), it is safe to cache this once, at plugin startup, and use it throughout its lifetime. Thus, we replace this SystemView access with a stored boolean variable computed ahead of time.

When creating new networks (such as in CircleCI) or when running via Podman (which has its own set of network ranges), this initial config will no longer be applicable. We thus need to write a new config into the image; while we could do this by rebuilding a new image on top of the existing layers (provisioning our config), we then need to manage these changes and give hooks for the service setup to build it.

This operation is disabled by default (to avoid load on clusters which don't need tidy to be run) but can be enabled. In particular, a default tidy configuration is written (via /config/auto-tidy) which mirrors the options passed to /tidy. Two additional parameters, enabled and interval, are accepted, allowing auto-tidy to be enabled or disabled and controlling the interval (between successful tidy runs) to attempt auto-tidy. Notably, a manual execution of tidy will delay additional auto-tidy operations. Status is reported via the existing /tidy-status endpoint.

1465,Move to go 1.17 (#12868),0.66069317,1.13.0," Allow generation of up-to-date delta CRLs  While switching to periodic rebuilds of CRLs alleviates the constant rebuild pressure on Vault during times of high revocation, the CRL proper becomes stale. One response to this is to switch to OCSP, but not every system has support for this. Additionally, OCSP usually requires connectivity and isn't used to augment a pre-distributed CRL (and is instead used independently). By generating delta CRLs containing only new revocations, an existing CRL can be supplemented with newer revocations without requiring Vault to rebuild all complete CRLs. Admins can periodically fetch the delta CRL and add it to the existing CRL and applications should be able to support using serials from both. Because delta CRLs are emptied when the next complete CRL is rebuilt, it is important that applications fetch the delta CRL and correlate it to their complete CRL; if their complete CRL is older than the delta CRL's extension number, applications MUST fetch the newer complete CRL to ensure they have a correct combination. This modifies the revocation process and adds several new configuration options, controlling whether Delta CRLs are enabled and when we'll rebuild it.

1473,Fix typos in Azure Secrets Engine docs (#5295),0.6581317,secrets/azure: Fixed bug where Azure environment did not change Graph URL [GH-13973]," Refactor tidy steps into two separate helpers  This refactors the tidy go routine into two separate helpers, making it clear where the boundaries of each are: variables are passed into these method and concerns are separated. As more operations are rolled into tidy, we can continue adding more helpers as appropriate. Additionally, as we move to make auto-tidy occur, we can use these as points to hook into periodic tidying. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor revInfo checking to helper  This allows us to validate whether or not a revInfo entry contains a presently valid issuer, from the existing mapping. Coupled with the changeset to identify the issuer on revocation, we can begin adding capabilities to tidy to update this association, decreasing CRL build time and increasing the performance of OCSP. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor issuer fetching for revocation purposes  Revocation needs to gracefully handle using the old legacy cert bundle, so fetching issuers (and parsing them) needs to be done slightly differently than other places. Refactor this from revokeCert into a common helper that can be used by tidy. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow tidy to associate revoked certs, issuers  When revoking a certificate, we need to associate the issuer that signed its certificate back to the revInfo entry. Historically this was performed during CRL building (and still remains so), but when running without CRL building and with only OCSP, performance will degrade as the issuer needs to be found each time. Instead, allow the tidy operation to take over this role, allowing us to increase the performance of OCSP and CRL in this scenario, by decoupling issuer identification from CRL building in the ideal case.

1489,vault: first pass at HA standby mode,0.5875904,Vault and Vault Enterprise and is fixed in 1.6.2 (CVE-2020-25594).," Refactor CRL tests to use /sys/mounts  Thanks Steve for the approach! This also address nits from Kit. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Skip CRL building steps when disabled  This skips a number of steps during CRL build when it is disabled (and forceNew is not set). In particular, we avoid fetching issuers, we avoid associating issuers with revocation entries (and building that in-memory mapping), making CRL building more efficient. This means that there'll again be very little overhead on clusters with the CRL disabled. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Prevent revoking roots from appearing on own CRLs  This change ensures that when marking a root as revoked, it no longer appears on its own CRL. Very few clients support this event (as generally only leaves/intermediates are checked for presence on a parent's CRL) and it is technically undefined behavior (if the root is revoked, its own CRL should be untrusted and thus including it on its own CRL isn't a safe/correct distribution channel). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Ensure stability of revInfo issuer identification  As mentioned by Kit, iterating through each revInfoEntry and associating the first issuer which matches it can cause churn when many (equivalent) issuers are in the system and issuers come and go (via CRLSigning usage, which has been modified in this release as well). Because we'd not include issuers without CRLSigning usage, we'd cause our verification helper, isRevInfoIssuerValid, to think the issuer ID is no longer value (when instead, it just lacks crlSigning bits). We address this by pulling in all issuers we know of for the identification. This allows us to keep valid-but-not-for-signing issuers, and use other representatives of their identity set for signing/building the CRL (if they are enabled for such usage). As a side effect, we now no longer place these entries on the default CRL in the event all issuers in the CRL set are without the usage.

This change makes it clear (at issuer configuration time) that we can't possibly support this operation and hopefully prevent users from running into the more cryptic Go error. Note that this does not apply for OCSP EKU: the EKU exists, per RFC 6960 Section 2.6 OCSP Signature Authority Delegation, to allow delegation of OCSP signing to a child certificate. This EKU is not necessary on the issuer itself, and generally assumes issuers are allowed to issue OCSP responses regardless of KU/EKU.

1528,Move token helper out of meta,0.53897804,transform (enterprise): Fix bug where tokenization store changes are persisted but don't take effect," Add per-issuer AIA URI information  Per discussion on GitHub with @maxb, this allows issuers to have their own copy of AIA URIs. Because each issuer has its own URLs (for CA and CRL access), its necessary to mint their issued certs pointing to the correct issuer and not to the global default issuer.

We disable issuance (via removing the usage) and prohibit modifying the usage via the regular issuer management interface. A separate endpoint is necessary because issuers (especially if signed by a third-party CA using incremental serial numbers) might share a serial number (e.g., an intermediate under cross-signing might share the same number as an external root or an unrelated intermediate).

This allows callers to revoke certificate they own (as proven by holding the corresponding private key), without having an admin create innumerable ACLs around the serial_number parameter for every issuance/user. We base this on Go TLS stack's verification of certificate<->key matching, but extend it where applicable to ensure curves match, the private key is indeed valid, and has the same structure as the corresponding public key from the certificate. This endpoint currently is authenticated, allowing operators to disable the endpoint if it isn't desirable to use, via ACL policies.

In particular, Vault verifies the signature on the certificate from an existing issuer within the mount, ensuring that one indeed issued this certificate. The certificate is then added to storage and its serial submitted for revocation. This allows certificates generated with no_store=true to be submitted for revocation afterwards, given a full copy of the certificate. As a consequence, all roles can now safely move to no_store=true (if desired for performance) and revocation can be done on a case-by-case basis.

(#15010),0.5031109,BUG FIXES:," Add PSS signature support to Vault PKI engine  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Use issuer's RevocationSigAlg for CRL signing  We introduce a new parameter on issuers, revocation_signature_algorithm to control the signature algorithm used during CRL signing. This is because the SignatureAlgorithm value from the certificate itself is incorrect for this purpose: a RSA root could sign an ECDSA intermediate with say, SHA256WithRSA, but when the intermediate goes to sign a CRL, it must use ECDSAWithSHA256 or equivalent instead of SHA256WithRSA. When coupled with support for PSS-only keys, allowing the user to set the signature algorithm value as desired seems like the best approach. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add use_pss, revocation_signature_algorithm docs  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add PSS to signature role issuance test matrix  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add changelog  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow roots to self-identify revocation alg  When using PSS support with a managed key, sometimes the underlying device will not support PKCS#1v1.5 signatures. This results in CRL building failing, unless we update the entry's signature algorithm prior to building the CRL for the new root. With a RSA-type key and use_pss=true, we use the signature bits value to decide which hash function to use for PSS support. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add clearer error message on failed import  When CRL building fails during cert/key import, due to PSS failures, give a better indication to the user that import succeeded its just CRL building that failed.

In particular, OpenSSL appears to be unique in requiring a SKID/AKID match for chain building. If AKID and SKID are present on an otherwise valid client/parent cert pair and the values are different, OpenSSL will not build a valid path over those two, whereas most other chain validation implementations will. Regardless, to have proper cross-signing support, we really aught to support copying an SKID. This adds such support to the sign-intermediate endpoint. Support for the /issue endpoint is not added, as cross-signing leaf certs isn't generally useful and can accept random SKIDs.

Can stop Agent from attempting to delete the file, which is useful in k8s where the service account JWT is mounted as a read-only file and so any attempt to delete it generates spammy error logs. When leaving the JWT file in place, the read period for new tokens is 1 minute instead of 500ms to reflect the assumption that there will always be a file there, so finding a file does not provide any signal that it needs to be re-read. Kubernetes has a minimum TTL of 10 minutes for tokens, so a period of 1 minute gives Agent plenty of time to detect new tokens, without leaving it too unresponsive.

We rely on the seal to manage trust.  It’s possible to use multiple join requests to switch nodes from voter to non-voter. The screenshot shows a 3 node cluster where vault_2 is the leader, and vault_3 and vault_4 are followers with non-voters set to false.  sent two requests to the raft join endpoint to have vault_3 and vault_4 join the cluster with non_voters:true.  This commit fixes the issue by delaying the call to SetDesiredSuffrage until after the initialization check, preventing unauthenticated mangling of voter status. Tested locally using https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-tools/blob/main/users/ncabatoff/cluster/raft.sh and the reproducer outlined in VAULT-6773.  raft: Return join err on failure  This is necessary to correctly distinguish errors returned from the Join workflow. Previously, errors were being masked as timeouts.  raft: Default autopilot parameters in teststorage  Change some defaults so we don't have to pass in parameters or set them in the originating tests.

2006,PR review updates,0.487127,IMPROVEMENTS:," Fix handling of username_as_alias during LDAP authentication  There is a bug that was introduced in the LDAP authentication method by https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/11000. It was thought to be backward compatible but has broken a number of users. Later a new parameter username_as_alias was introduced in https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/14324 to make it possible for operators to restore the previous behavior. The way it is currently working is not completely backward compatible thought because when username_as_alias is set, a call to GetUserAliasAttributeValue() will first be made, then this value is completely discarded in pathLogin() and replaced by the username as expected. This is an issue because it makes useless calls to the LDAP server and will break backward compatibility if one of the constraints in GetUserAliasAttributeValue() is not respected, even though the resulting value will be discarded anyway. In order to maintain backward compatibility here we have to only call GetUserAliasAttributeValue() if necessary. Since this change of behavior was introduced in 1.9, this fix will need to be backported to the 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches.

Strictly, this field, if it were to exist, would control the CSR's internal signature algorithm (certutil defaults to the sane SHA-256 here). However, there's little value in changing this as the signing authority can and probably will override the final certificate's signature bits value, completely ignoring whatever was in the provided CSR. Removing this field will now cause warnings for those providing the parameter (which already wasn't respected), which is the desired behavior. No breakage should occur as a result of this change.

Partial revert of #15435   The key_type field should be used solely for the key algorithm but as implemented    we would be returning the value ManagedPrivateKey for managed keys which is not    in sync with the rest of the apis. We also did not want to take the performance    hit if many managed keys existed so we will simply remove the field from the list    operation ,0

2122,logical/postgresql: connection,0.6257142,physical/postgresql: pass context to queries to propagate timeouts and cancellations on requests. [GH-15866],"  Starter PKI CA Storage API (#14796)   Simple starting PKI storage api for CA rotation  Add key and issuer storage apis Add listKeys and listIssuers storage implementations  Add simple keys and issuers configuration storage api methods   Handle resolving key, issuer references   The API context will usually have a user-specified reference to the key. This is either the literal string ""default"" to select the default key, an identifier of the key, or a slug name for the key. Here, we wish to resolve this reference to an actual identifier that can be understood by storage. Also adds the missing Name field to keys. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add method to fetch an issuer's cert bundle  This adds a method to construct a certutil.CertBundle from the specified issuer identifier, optionally loading its corresponding key for signing. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor certutil PrivateKey PEM handling  This refactors the parsing of PrivateKeys from PEM blobs into shared methods (ParsePEMKey, ParseDERKey) that can be reused by the existing Bundle parsing logic (ParsePEMBundle) or independently in the new issuers/key-based PKI storage code. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add importKey, importCert to PKI storage  importKey is generally preferable to the low-level writeKey for adding new entries. This takes only the contents of the private key (as a string -- so a PEM bundle or a managed key handle) and checks if it already exists in the storage. If it does, it returns the existing key instance. Otherwise, we create a new one. In the process, we detect any issuers using this key and link them back to the new key entry. The same holds for importCert over importKey, with the note that keys are not modified when importing certificates. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for importing issuers, keys  This adds tests for importing keys and issuers into the new storage layout, ensuring that identifiers are correctly inferred and linked. Note that directly writing entries to storage (writeKey/writeissuer) will take KeyID links from the parent entry and should not be used for import; only existing entries should be updated with this info. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Implement PKI storage migration.   Hook into the backend::initialize function, calling the migration on a primary only.   Migrate an existing certificate bundle to the new issuers and key layout   Make fetchCAInfo aware of new storage layout   This allows fetchCAInfo to fetch a specified issuer, via a reference parameter provided by the user. We pass that into the storage layer and have it return a cert bundle for us. Finally, we need to validate that it truly has the key desired. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Begin /issuers API endpoints  This implements the fetch operations around issuers in the PKI Secrets Engine. We implement the following operations:  LIST /issuers - returns a list of known issuers' IDs and names. GET /issuer/:ref - returns a JSON blob with information about this    issuer. POST /issuer/:ref - allows configuring information about issuers,    presently just its name. DELETE /issuer/:ref - allows deleting the specified issuer. GET /issuer/:ref/{der,pem} - returns a raw API response with just    the DER (or PEM) of the issuer's certificate.  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add import to PKI Issuers API  This adds the two core import code paths to the API: /issuers/import/cert and /issuers/import/bundle. The former differs from the latter in that the latter allows the import of keys. This allows operators to restrict importing of keys to privileged roles, while allowing more operators permission to import additional certificates (not used for signing, but instead for path/chain building). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-intermediate endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to sign intermediate CA certificates. In the process, we've updated the existing /root/sign-intermediate endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/default/sign-intermediate. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-self-issued endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to sign self-signed certificates. In the process, we've updated the existing /root/sign-self-issued endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/default/sign-self-issued. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-verbatim endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to directly sign CSRs. In the process, we've updated the existing /sign-verbatim endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/:ref/sign-verbatim. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow configuration of default issuers  Using the new updateDefaultIssuerId(...) from the storage migration PR allows for easy implementation of configuring the default issuer. We restrict callers from setting blank defaults and setting default to default. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix fetching default issuers  After setting a default issuer, one should be able to use the old /ca, /ca_chain, and /cert/{ca,ca_chain} endpoints to fetch the default issuer (and its chain). Update the fetchCertBySerial helper to no longer support fetching the ca and prefer fetchCAInfo for that instead (as we've already updated that to support fetching the new issuer location). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/{sign,issue}/:role  This updates the /sign and /issue endpoints, allowing them to take the default issuer (if none is provided by a role) and adding issuer-specific versions of them. Note that at this point in time, the behavior isn't yet ideal (as /sign/:role allows adding the ref=... parameter to override the default issuer); a later change adding role-based issuer specification will fix this incorrect behavior. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Add support root issuer generation   Add support for issuer generate intermediate end-point   Update issuer and key arguments to consistent values   Update all new API endpoints to use the new agreed upon argument names.  issuer_ref & key_ref to refer to existing issuer_name & key_name for new definitions  Update returned values to always user issuer_id and key_id   Add utility methods to fetch common ref and name arguments   Add utility methods to fetch the issuer_name, issuer_ref, key_name and key_ref arguments from data fields.   Centralize the logic to clean up these inputs and apply various validations to all of them.   Rename common PKI backend handlers   Use the buildPath convention for the function name instead of common...   Move setting PKI defaults from writeCaBundle to proper import{keys,issuer} methods   PR feedback, move setting up the default configuration references within    the import methods instead of within the writeCaBundle method. This should    now cover all use cases of us setting up the defaults properly.   Introduce constants for issuer_ref, rename isKeyDefaultSet...   Fix legacy PKI sign-verbatim api path   Addresses some test failures due to an incorrect refactoring of a legacy api    path /sign-verbatim within PKI   Use import code to handle intermediate, config/ca   The existing bundle import code will satisfy the intermediate import; use it instead of the old ca_bundle import logic. Additionally, update /config/ca to use the new import code as well. While testing, a panic was discovered:  reflect.Value.SetMapIndex: value of type string is not assignable to type pki.keyId  This was caused by returning a map with type issuerId->keyId; instead switch to returning string->string maps so the audit log can properly HMAC them. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Clarify error message on missing defaults  When the default issuer and key are missing (and haven't yet been specified), we should clarify that error message. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update test semantics for new changes  This makes two minor changes to the existing test suite:  Importing partial bundles should now succeed, where they'd     previously error. fetchCertBySerial no longer handles CA certificates.  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add support for deleting all keys, issuers  The old DELETE /root code must now delete all keys and issuers for backwards compatibility. We strongly suggest calling individual delete methods (DELETE /key/:key_ref or DELETE /issuer/:issuer_ref) instead, for finer control. In the process, we detect whether the deleted key/issuers was set as the default. This will allow us to warn (from the single key/deletion issuer code) whether or not the default was deleted (while allowing the operation to succeed). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Introduce defaultRef constant within PKI   Replace hardcoded ""default"" references with a constant to easily identify various usages.   Use the addIssuerRefField function instead of redefining the field in various locations.   Rework PKI test TestBackend_Root_Idempotency   Validate that generate/root calls are no longer idempotent, but the bundle importing    does not generate new keys/issuers  As before make sure that the delete root api resets everything  Address a bug within the storage that we bombed when we had multiple different    key types within storage.   Assign Name=current to migrated key and issuer   Detail I missed from the RFC was to assign the Name field as ""current"" for migrated key and issuer.   Build CRL upon PKI intermediary set-signed api called   Add a call to buildCRL if we created an issuer within pathImportIssuers  Augment existing FullCAChain to verify we have a proper CRL post set-signed api call  Remove a code block writing out ""ca"" storage entry that is no longer used.   Identify which certificate or key failed   When importing complex chains, we should identify in which certificate or key the failure occurred. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   PKI migration writes out empty migration log entry   Since the elements of the struct were not exported we serialized an empty    migration log to disk and would re-run the migration   Add chain-building logic to PKI issuers path   With the one-entry-per-issuer approach, CA Chains become implicitly constructed from the pool of issuers. This roughly matches the existing expectations from /config/ca (wherein a chain could be provided) and /intemediate/set-signed (where a chain may be provided). However, in both of those cases, we simply accepted a chain. Here, we need to be able to reconstruct the chain from parts on disk. However, with potential rotation of roots, we need to be aware of disparate chains. Simply concating together all issuers isn't sufficient. Thus we need to be able to parse a certificate's Issuer and Subject field and reconstruct valid (and potentially parallel) parent<->child mappings. This attempts to handle roots, intermediates, cross-signed intermediates, cross-signed roots, and rotated keys (wherein one might not have a valid signature due to changed key material with the same subject). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Return CA Chain when fetching issuers  This returns the CA Chain attribute of an issuer, showing its computed chain based on other issuers in the database, when fetching a specific issuer. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add testing for chain building  Using the issuance infrastructure, we generate new certificates (either roots or intermediates), positing that this is roughly equivalent to importing an external bundle (minus error handling during partial imports). This allows us to incrementally construct complex chains, creating reissuance cliques and cross-signing cycles. By using ECDSA certificates, we avoid high signature verification and key generation times. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow manual construction of issuer chain  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix handling of duplicate names  With the new issuer field (manual_chain), we can no longer err when a name already exists: we might be updating the existing issuer (with the same name), but changing its manual_chain field. Detect this error and correctly handle it. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for manual chain building  We break the clique, instead building these chains manually, ensuring that the remaining chains do not change and only the modified certs change. We then reset them (back to implicit chain building) and ensure we get the same results as earlier. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add stricter verification of issuers PEM format  This ensures each issuer is only a single certificate entry (as validated by count and parsing) without any trailing data. We further ensure that each certificate PEM has leading and trailing spaces removed with only a single trailing new line remaining. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix full chain building  Don't set the legacy IssuingCA field on the certificate bundle, as we prefer the CAChain field over it. Additionally, building the full chain could result in duplicate certificates when the CAChain included the leaf certificate itself. When building the full chain, ensure we don't include the bundle's certificate twice. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add stricter tests for full chain construction  We wish to ensure that each desired certificate in the chain is only present once. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Rename PKI types to avoid constant variable name collisions  keyId -> keyID  issuerId -> issuerID  key -> keyEntry  issuer -> issuerEntry  keyConfig -> keyConfigEntry  issuerConfig -> issuerConfigEntry  Update CRL handling for multiple issuers  When building CRLs, we've gotta make sure certs issued by that issuer land up on that issuer's CRL and not some other CRL. If no CRL is found (matching a cert), we'll place it on the default CRL. However, in the event of equivalent issuers (those with the same subject AND the same key  material) -- perhaps due to reissuance -- we'll only create a single (unified) CRL for them. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow fetching updated CRL locations  This updates fetchCertBySerial to support querying the default issuer's CRL. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove legacy CRL storage location test case  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update to CRLv2 Format to copy RawIssuer  When using the older Certificate.CreateCRL(...) call, Go's x509 library copies the parsed pkix.Name version of the CRL Issuer's Subject field. For certain constructed CAs, this fails since pkix.Name is not suitable for round-tripping. This also builds a CRLv1 (per RFC 5280) CRL. In updating to the newer x509.CreateRevocationList(...) call, we can construct the CRL in the CRLv2 format and correctly copy the issuer's name. However, this requires holding an additional field per-CRL, the CRLNumber field, which is required in Go's implementation of CRLv2 (though OPTIONAL in the spec). We store this on the new LocalCRLConfigEntry object, per-CRL. Co-authored-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add comment regarding CRL non-assignment in GOTO  In previous versions of Vault, it was possible to sign an empty CRL (when the CRL was disabled and a force-rebuild was requested). Add a comment about this case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow fetching the specified issuer's CRL  We add a new API endpoint to fetch the specified issuer's CRL directly (rather than the default issuer's CRL at /crl and /certs/crl). We also add a new test to validate the CRL in a multi-root scenario and ensure it is signed with the correct keys. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Add new PKI key prefix to seal wrapped storage (#15126)   Refactor common backend initialization within backend_test   Leverage an existing helper method within the PKI backend tests to setup a PKI backend with storage.   Add ability to read legacy cert bundle if the migration has not occurred on secondaries.   Track the migration state forbidding an issuer/key writing api call if we have not migrated  For operations that just need to read the CA bundle, use the same tracking variable to    switch between reading the legacy bundle or use the new key/issuer storage.  Add an invalidation function that will listen for updates to our log path to refresh the state    on secondary clusters.   Always write migration entry to trigger secondary clusters to wake up   Some PR feedback and handle a case in which the primary cluster does    not have a CA bundle within storage but somehow a secondary does.   Update CA Chain to report entire chain   This merges the ca_chain JSON field (of the /certs/ca_chain path) with the regular certificate field, returning the root of trust always. This also affects the non-JSON (raw) endpoints as well. We return the default issuer's chain here, rather than all known issuers (as that may not form a strict chain). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow explicit issuer override on roles  When a role is used to generate a certificate (such as with the sign/ and issue/ legacy paths or the legacy sign-verbatim/ paths), we prefer that issuer to the one on the request. This allows operators to set an issuer (other than default) for requests to be issued against, effectively making the change no different from the users' perspective as it is ""just"" a different role name. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for role-based issuer selection  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Expand NotAfter limit enforcement behavior  Vault previously strictly enforced NotAfter/ttl values on certificate requests, erring if the requested TTL extended past the NotAfter date of the issuer. In the event of issuing an intermediate, this behavior was ignored, instead permitting the issuance. Users generally do not think to check their issuer's NotAfter date when requesting a certificate; thus this behavior was generally surprising. Per RFC 5280 however, issuers need to maintain status information throughout the life cycle of the issued cert. If this leaf cert were to be issued for a longer duration than the parent issuer, the CA must still maintain revocation information past its expiration. Thus, we add an option to the issuer to change the desired behavior:  err, to err out, permit, to permit the longer NotAfter date, or truncate, to silently truncate the expiration to the issuer's    NotAfter date.  Since expiration of certificates in the system's trust store are not generally validated (when validating an arbitrary leaf, e.g., during TLS validation), permit should generally only be used in that case. However, browsers usually validate intermediate's validity periods, and thus truncate should likely be used (as with permit, the leaf's chain will not validate towards the end of the issuance period).

We switch to the new format everywhere, updating some bad assumptions about forwarding along the way. Anywhere writes are handled (that should be propagated to all nodes in all clusters), we choose to forward the request all the way up to the performance primary cluster's primary node. This holds for issuers/keys, roles, and configs (such as CRL config, which is globally set for all clusters despite all clusters having their own separate CRL).

Handle issuer, keys locking (#15227)   Handle locking of issuers during writes   We need a write lock around writes to ensure serialization of modifications.

From a consistency perspective, we need to ensure the remaining chains are correct and don't refer to the since-deleted issuer, so trigger a full rebuild here. We don't need to call this in the delete-the-world (DELETE /root) code path, as there shouldn't be any remaining issuers or chains to build. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove legacy CRL bundle on world deletion  When calling DELETE /root, we should remove the legacy CRL bundle, since we're deleting the legacy CA issuer bundle as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove deleted issuers' CRL entries  Since CRLs are no longer resolvable after deletion (due to missing issuer ID, which will cause resolution to fail regardless of if an ID or a name/default reference was used), we should delete these CRLs from storage to avoid leaking them. In the event that this issuer comes back (with key material), we can simply rebuild the CRL at that time (from the remaining revoked storage entries).

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add JSON-specific endpoint for fetching issuers Unlike the unqualified /issuer/:ref endpoint (which also returns JSON), we have a separate /issuer/:ref/json endpoint to return only the PEM-encoded certificate and the chain, mirroring the existing /cert/ca endpoint but for a specific issuer. This allows us to make the endpoint unauthenticated, whereas the bare endpoint would remain authenticated and usually privileged. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add tests for raw JSON endpoints Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add unauthenticated issuers endpoints to PKI table  This adds the unauthenticated issuers endpoints?

Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add issuer usage restrictions bitset  This allows issuers to have usage restrictions, limiting whether they can be used to issue certificates or if they can generate CRLs. This allows certain issuers to not generate a CRL (if the global config is with the CRL enabled) or allows the issuer to not issue new certificates (but potentially letting the CRL generation continue). Setting both fields to false effectively forms a soft delete capability.

This will allow sign operations on these paths to function correctly, having the correctly inferred default signature bit length. Additionally, this allows the computed default value for key type to be used for minimum size validation in the RSA/ECDSA paths. We additionally enforce the 2048-minimum in this case as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix defaults and validation of ""any"" KeyType  When certutil is given the placeholder any keytype, it attempts to validate and update the default zero value. However, in lacking a default value for SignatureBits, it cannot update the value from the zero value, thus causing validation to fail.

This will allow sign operations on these paths to function correctly, having the correctly inferred default signature bit length. Additionally, this allows the computed default value for key type to be used for minimum size validation in the RSA/ECDSA paths. We additionally enforce the 2048-minimum in this case as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix defaults and validation of ""any"" KeyType  When certutil is given the placeholder any keytype, it attempts to validate and update the default zero value. However, in lacking a default value for SignatureBits, it cannot update the value from the zero value, thus causing validation to fail. Add more awareness to the placeholder ""any"" value to certutil. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add role-based regression tests for key bits  This adds regression tests for Key Type, Key Bits, and Signature Bits parameters on the role.

We default (both on migration and new role creation) to the less secure true value for backwards compatibility with existing Vault versions. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor sanitizedName to reducedName  Per comment, this variable name was confusing during the reproduction and subsequent fix of the earlier vulnerability and associated bug report. Because the common name isn't necessarily sanitized in any way (and indeed must be considered in relation to other parts or the whole), but portions of the entire name are removed, reducedName appears to make the most sense. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Enforce AllowWildcardCertificates during issuance  This commit adds the bulk of correctly validating wildcard certificate Common Names during issuance according to RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 semantics. As part of this, support for RFC 2818-conforming wildcard certificates (wherein there are almost no restrictions on issuance) has been removed. Note that this flag does take precedence over AllowAnyName, giving a little more safety in wildcard issuance in this case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update test cases to conform with RFC 6125  Test cases 19, 70+71, and 83+84 didn't conform with the RFC 6125, and so should've been rejected under strict conformance. For 70+71 and 83+84, we previously conditioned around the value of AllowSubdomains (allowing issuance when true), but they likely should've been rejected either way. Additionally, update the notes about globs matching wildcard certificates to notate this is indeed the case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Check AllowWildcardCertifciates in issuance tests  This allows for regression tests to cover the new AllowWildcardCertificate conditional. We add additional test cases ensuring that wildcard issuance is properly forbidden in all relevant scenarios, while allowing the existing test cases to validate that wildcard status doesn't affect non-wildcard certificates.

2488,website: update alert banner (#11801),0.5900974,core: Fixes code scanning alerts [GH-13667]," Allow issuance of wildcard via glob match  From Vault v1.8.0 onwards, we would incorrectly disallow issuance of a wildcard certificate when allow_glob_domain was enabled with a multi-part glob domain in allowed_domains (such as ..foo) when attempting to issue a wildcard for a subdomain (such as *.bar.foo). This fixes that by reverting an errant change in the case insensitivity patch. Here, when validating against a very powerful glob construct, we leave the wildcard prefix (*.) from the raw common_name element, to allow multi-part globs to match wildcard entries. It is important to note that ""sanitizedName"" is an incorrect variable naming here. Wildcard parsing (per RFC 6125 which supercedes RFC 2818) must be in the left-most segment of the domain, but we lack validation to ensure no internal wildcards exist. Additionally per item 3 of section 6.4.3 of RFC 6125, wildcards MAY be internal to a domain segment, in which case sanitizedName again leaves the wildcard in place.

Per RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.13, application/pkix-crl is only appropriate when the CRL is in DER form. Likewise, Section 4.2.2.1 states that application/pkix-cert is only applicable when a single DER certificate is used. Per recommendation in RFC 8555 (""ACME""), Section 7.4.2 and 9.1, we use the newer application/pem-certificate-chain media type for certificates. However, this is not applicable for CRLs, so we use fall back to application/x-pem-file for these. Notably, no official IETF source is present for the latter. On the OpenSSL PKI tutorial (https://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mime.html), this type is cited as coming from S/MIME's predecessor, PEM, but neither of the main PEM RFCs (RFC 934, 1421, 1422, 1423, or 1424) mention this type.

The AWS Auth backend uses the ""whitelist"" and ""blacklist"" term extensively, and these are the focus of the PR:  Add new API endpoints that use the preferred terminology, while   deprecating the old endpoints. These endpoints offer identical   functionality and are basically aliases. This is the only functional   change in the PR except for terms in error messages. Replace ""whitelist"" -> ""access list"", ""blacklist"" -> ""deny list"" in   variable names, comments, etc.  Note that storage locations were not changed at this time, as that is a more complex process involving versioning that we may tackle in a future revision. We have reduced the occurrences of non-inclusive language, however.

For specific concurrent executions the grabLockOrStop function can return stopped=true when the lock is still held. A comment in grabLockOrStop indicates that the function is only used when the stateLock is held, but grabLockOrStop is being used to acquire the stateLock. If there are concurrent goroutines using grabLockOrStop then some concurrent executions result in stopped=true being returned when the lock is acquired. The fix is to add a lock and some state around which the parent and child goroutine in the grabLockOrStop function can coordinate so that the different concurrent executions can be handled. This change includes a non-deterministic unit test which reliably reproduces the problem before the fix.  use rand instead of time for random test stopCh close  Using time.Now().UnixNano()%2 ends up being system dependent because different operating systems and hardware have different clock resolution. A lower resolution will return the same unix time for a longer period of time. It is better to avoid this issue by using a random number generator. This change uses the rand package default random number generator. It's generally good to avoid using the default random number generator, because it creates extra lock contention.

These verify that you can't verify something signed using JWS marshaling when claiming it's ASN1, and vice versa.  The problem is that we rely on unmarshaling failing, and it doesn't always.  Both encodings use base64, one with padding, one without, so depending on the data sometimes unmarshaling will work when we expect it to fail.  It would be nice to preserve these tests if they could be made reliable, but I didn't see an easy way, and I don't think they add enough value to warrant greater effort.   Restore the tests I removed, and improve the verify function to broaden the notion of errExpected.   Co-authored-by: Vishal Nayak vishalnayak@users.noreply.github.com",0

Vault already collects policy ARNs for iam_user credential types; now it will allow policy ARNs for assumed_role and federation_token credential types and plumb them through to the appropriate AWS calls. This brings along a minor breaking change. Vault roles of the federation_token credential type are now required to have either a policy_document or a policy_arns specified. This was implicit previously; a missing policy_document would result in a validation error from the AWS SDK when retrieving credentials. However, it would still allow creating a role that didn't have a policy_document specified and then later specifying it, after which retrieving the AWS credentials would work. Similar workflows in which the Vault role didn't have a policy_document specified for some period of time, such as deleting the policy_document and then later adding it back, would also have worked previously but will now be broken. The reason for this breaking change is because a credential_type of federation_token without either a policy_document or policy_arns specified will return credentials that have equivalent permissions to the credentials the Vault server itself is using. This is quite dangerous (e.g., it could allow Vault clients access to retrieve credentials that could modify Vault's underlying storage) and so should be discouraged. This scenario is still possible when passing in an appropriate policy_document or policy_arns parameter, but clients should be explicitly aware of what they are doing and opt in to it by passing in the appropriate role parameters.  Error out on dangerous federation token retrieval  The AWS secrets role code now disallows creation of a dangerous role configuration; however, pre-existing roles could have existed that would trigger this now-dangerous code path, so also adding a check for this configuration at credential retrieval time.

This is necessary so that we can list the sys bucket, get a list of all child keys, and then trim this down to find child 'folders' eg food. Right now however, we store the full value of every storage entry in all three buckets. This is unnecessary as the value will only ever be read out in the leaf bucket ie sys/foo/bar. We use the intermediary buckets simply for listing keys. We have seen some issues around compaction where certain buckets, particularly intermediary buckets that are exclusively for listing, get really clogged up with data to the point of not being listable. Buckets like sys/expire/id are huge, combining lease expiry data for all auth methods, and need to be listed for vault to successfully become leader. This PR tries to cut down on the amount of data stored in intermediary buckets.  Avoid goroutine leak by buffering results channel up to the bucket count",0

6532,Move reload/listenerutil/gatedwriter back out of sdk,0.5674708,sdk: Don't panic if system view or storage methods called during plugin setup. [GH-18210]," Fix various read only storage errors  A mistake we've seen multiple times in our own plugins and that we've seen in the GCP plugin now is that control flow (how the code is structured, helper functions, etc.) can obfuscate whether an error came from storage or some other Vault-core location (in which case likely it needs to be a 5XX message) or because of user input (thus 4XX). Error handling for functions therefore often ends up always treating errors as either user related or internal. When the error is logical.ErrReadOnly this means that treating errors as user errors skips the check that triggers forwarding, instead returning a read only view error to the user. While it's obviously more correct to fix that code, it's not always immediately apparent to reviewers or fixers what the issue is and fixing it when it's found both requires someone to hit the problem and report it (thus exposing bugs to users) and selective targeted refactoring that only helps that one specific case. If instead we check whether the logical.Response is an error and, if so, whether it contains the error value, we work around this in all of these cases automatically. It feels hacky since it's a coding mistake, but it's one we've made too multiple times, and avoiding bugs altogether is better for our users.",0

This meant you could then create a duplicate mount using the same path which would then not conflict in the router until postUnseal.

Check return value of UnsealWithStoredKeys in sys/init   Return proper error types when attempting unseal with stored key   Prior to this commit, ""nil"" could have meant unsupported auto-unseal, a transient error, or success. This updates the function to return the correct error type, signaling to the caller whether they should retry or fail.  Continuously attempt to unseal if sealed keys are supported  This fixes a bug that occurs on bootstrapping an initial cluster. Given a collection of Vault nodes and an initialized storage backend, they will all go into standby waiting for initialization. After one node is initialized, the other nodes had no mechanism by which they ""re-check"" to see if unseal keys are present. This adds a goroutine to the server command which continually waits for unseal keys to exist. It exits in the following conditions:  the node is unsealed the node does not support stored keys a fatal error occurs (as defined by Vault) the server is shutting down  In all other situations, the routine wakes up at the specified interval and attempts to unseal with the stored keys.",0

Key lookups are a different API method not covered by roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter. This means users must grant an extended scope to their service account (granting the ability to read key data) which only seems to be used to validate the existence of the key. Worse, the only roles that include this permission are overly verbose (e.g. roles/viewer which gives readonly access to everything in the project and roles/cloudkms.admin which gives full control over all key operations). This leaves the user stuck between choosing to create a custom IAM role (which isn't fun) or grant overly broad permissions.

[GH-14945]"," Strip empty strings from database revocation stmts  It's technically valid to give empty strings as statements to run on most databases. However, in the case of revocation statements, it's not only generally inadvisable but can lead to lack of revocations when you expect them. This strips empty strings from the array of revocation statements. It also makes two other changes:   Return statements on read as empty but valid arrays rather than nulls, so that typing information is inferred (this is more in line with the rest of Vault these days)   Changes field data for TypeStringSlice and TypeCommaStringSlice such that a client-supplied value of """" doesn't turn into []string{""""} but rather []string{}.

This patch uses a simple method to delete the sequence if present anywhere in the string, although it is strictly only needed at the start of input.  Simplify iTerm handling to only remove iTerm prefix  The logic now only removes the two byte prefix sent in by iTerm instead of trying to remove all deletes in the string.

8273,UI: glimmerize mount backend form (#18335),0.5753224,ui: Fix issue where UI incorrectly handled API errors when mounting backends [GH-14551]," logical/aws: Harden WAL entry creation  If AWS IAM user creation failed in any way, the WAL corresponding to the IAM user would get left around and Vault would try to roll it back. However, because the user never existed, the rollback failed. Thus, the WAL would essentially get ""stuck"" and Vault would continually attempt to roll it back, failing every time. A similar situation could arise if the IAM user that Vault created got deleted out of band, or if Vault deleted it but was unable to write the lease revocation back to storage (e.g., a storage failure). This attempts to harden it in two ways. One is by deleting the WAL log entry if the IAM user creation fails. However, the WAL deletion could still fail, and this wouldn't help where the user is deleted out of band, so second, consider the user rolled back if the user just doesn't exist, under certain circumstances. Fixes #5190  Fix segfault in expiration unit tests  TestExpiration_Tidy was passing in a leaseEntry that had a nil Secret, which then caused a segfault as the changes to revokeEntry didn't check whether Secret was nil; this is probably unlikely to occur in real life, but good to be extra cautious.

Rather than just use RoleSessionName as the Identity alias, the full ARN is uses as the Alias. This mitigates against concerns that an AWS role with an insufficiently secured trust policy could allow an attacker to generate arbitrary RoleSessionNames in AssumeRole calls to impersonate anybody in the Identity store that had an alias set up. By using the full ARN, the owner of the identity store has to explicitly trust specific AWS roles in specific AWS accounts to generate an appropriate RoleSessionName to map back to an identity.

[GH-13606]", Allow vault ssh to accept ssh commands in any ssh compatible format  Previously vault ssh required ssh commands to be in the format username@hostname <flags> command. While this works just fine for human users this breaks a lot of automation workflows and is not compatible with the options that the ssh client supports. Motivation We currently run ansible which uses vault ssh to connect to hosts. Ansible generates ssh commands with the format ssh <flags> -o User=username hostname command. While this is a valid ssh command it currently breaks with vault because vault expects the format to be username@hostname. To work around this we currently use a wrapper script to parse the correct username being set by ansible and translate this into a vault ssh compatible username@hostname format Changes  You can now specify arguments in any order that ssh client allows. All arguments are passed directly to the ssh command and the format isn't modified in any way. The username and port are parsed from the specified ssh command. It will accept all of the options supported by the ssh command and also will properly prefer -p and user@ if both options are specified. The ssh port is only added from the vault credentials if it hasn't been specified on the command line,0

Previously, only policies tied to tokens would be reported. This could make it difficult to perform after-the-fact analysis based on both the initial response entry and further requests. Now, the full set of applicable policies from both the token and any derived policies from Identity are reported. To keep things consistent, token authentications now also return the full set of policies in api.Secret.Auth responses, so this both makes it easier for users to understand their actual full set, and it matches what the audit logs now report.",0

There is an interesting benchmark at https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3h21nk/simple_micro_benchmark_to_measure_the_overhead_of/ It shows that defer actually adds quite a lot of overhead -- maybe 100ns per call but we defer a lot of functions in the request path. So this removes some of the ones in request handling, ha, barrier, router, and physical cache. One meta-note: nearly every metrics function is in a defer which means every metrics call we add could add a non-trivial amount of time, e.g. for every 10 extra metrics statements we add 1ms to a request. I don't know how to solve this right now without doing what I did in some of these cases and putting that call into a simple function call that then goes before each return.

9201,loosen match checking on replication show page (#7776),0.6099014,replication (enterprise): Fix issue where merkle.flushDirty.num_pages metric is not emitted if number,"This takes place in two parts, since working on this exposed an issue with response wrapping when there is a raw body set. The changes are (in diff order):   A CurrentWrappingLookupFunc has been added to return the current value. This is necessary for the lookahead call since we don't want the lookahead call to be wrapped.   Support for unwrapping < 0.6.2 tokens via the API/CLI has been removed, because we now have backends returning 404s with data and can't rely on the 404 trick. These can still be read manually via cubbyhole/response.   KV preflight version request now ensures that its calls is not wrapped, and restores any given function after.   When responding with a raw body, instead of always base64-decoding a string value and erroring on failure, on failure we assume that it simply wasn't a base64-encoded value and use it as is.   A test that fails on master and works now that ensures that raw body responses that are wrapped and then unwrapped return the expected values.   A flag for response data that indicates to the wrapping handling that the data contained therein is already JSON decoded (more later).   RespondWithStatusCode now defaults to a string so that the value is HMAC'd during audit. The function always JSON encodes the body, so before now it was always returning []byte which would skip HMACing. We don't know what's in the data, so this is a ""better safe than sorry"" issue. If different behavior is needed, backends can always manually populate the data instead of relying on the helper function.   We now check unwrapped data after unwrapping to see if there were raw flags. If so, we try to detect whether the value can be unbase64'd. The reason is that if it can it was probably originally a []byte and shouldn't be audit HMAC'd; if not, it was probably originally a string and should be. In either case, we then set the value as the raw body and hit the flag indicating that it's already been JSON decoded so not to try again before auditing. Doing it this way ensures the right typing.   There is now a check to see if the data coming from unwrapping is already JSON decoded and if so the decoding is skipped before setting the audit response. ",0

I think this is tested by every dev server though, since for a dev server Vault is inited, the default mounts are mounted, then it's sealed, then it's unsealed for the user, so it already goes through this code path.

9695,postgresql: Configurable max open connections to the database,0.627444,Postgres Database UI: The UI now supports adding and editing Postgres connections in the database secret engine. [GH-12945]," Accept temp creds in AWS secret backend acceptance tests  The AWS secret backend acceptance tests implicitly accepted long-lived AWS credentials (i.e., AWS IAM user and/or root credentials) in two ways:  It expected credentials to be passed in via the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables. By not accepting    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN or AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN, temporary credentials could    not be passed in. (This also forced all credentials to be passed in    via environment variables, which is a bit ugly). The AWS sts:GetFederationToken call is only allowed from long-term    credentials. This is called by the Vault code which the acceptance    tests exercise.  1 is solved by deleting explicit references to credentials, which allows the SDK to do one of the things it does best -- find credentials via the default chain. 2 is a little more complicated. Rather than pass in whatever creds the acceptance test was run under to the backend, the acceptance test now creates a new IAM user and gets an access key from it, then passes the IAM user's creds back to the backend so that it can call sts:GetFederationToken (and then tries to clean up afterwards).  Fix Travis build failure  The Travis build was failing because the user creation was happening regardless of whether it was running in acceptance test mode or not. This moves the user creation into the acceptance test precheck, which requires lazily evaluating the credentials when configuring the backend in the STS accetpance test, and so moving that to a PreFlight closure.  Reduce blind sleeps in AWS secret backend acceptance tests  This removes a blind ""sleep 10 seconds and then attempt to reuse the credential"" codepath and instead just keeps attemtping to reuse the credential for 10 seconds and fails if there aren't any successful uses after 10 seconds. This adds a few seconds speedup of acceptance test runs from my experiments.",0

[GH-18740],"Previously we lowercased names on ingress but not on lookup or delete which could cause unexpected results. Now, just unilaterally lowercase policy names on write and delete. On get, to avoid the performance hit of always lowercasing when not necessary since it's in the critical path, we have a minor optimization -- we check the LRU first before normalizing. For tokens, because they're already normalized when adding policies during creation, this should always work; it might just be slower for API calls. Fixes #3187",0

10842,command/read,0.43057588,api: Remove timeout logic from ReadRaw functions and add ReadRawWithContext [GH-18708],"  The current implementation of the SSH command is heavily tied to the assumptions of OTP/dynamic key types. The SSH CA backend is fundamentally a different approach to login and authentication. As a result, there was some restructuring of existing methods to share more code and state.   Each authentication method (ca, otp, dynamic) are now fully-contained in their own handle* function.   -mode and -role are going to be required for SSH CA, and I don't think the magical UX (and overhead) of guessing them is a good UX. It's confusing as to which role and how Vault guesses. We can reduce 66% of the API calls and add more declaration to the CLI by making -mode and -role required. This commit adds warnings for that deprecation, but these values are both required for CA type authentication.   The principal and extensions are currently fixed, and I personally believe that's good enough for the first pass at this. Until we understand what configuration options users will want, I think we should ship with all the local extensions enabled. Users who don't want that can generate the key themselves directly (current behavior) or submit PRs to make the map of extensions customizable.   Host key checking for the CA backend is not currently implemented. It's not strictly required at setup, so I need to think about whether it belongs here.   This is not ready for merge, but it's ready for early review.",0

This is a small rename commit to keep the commit history clean.  Expand aws-ec2 backend to more generic aws  This adds the ability to authenticate arbitrary AWS IAM principals using AWS's sts:GetCallerIdentity method. The AWS-EC2 auth backend is being to just AWS with the expansion.  Add missing aws auth handler to CLI  This was omitted from the previous commit  aws auth backend general variable name cleanup  Also fixed a bug where allowed auth types weren't being checked upon login, and added tests for it.   Update docs for the aws auth backend   Refactor aws bind validation   Fix env var override in aws backend test   Intent is to override the AWS environment variables with the TEST_* versions if they are set, but the reverse was happening.  Update docs on use of IAM authentication profile  AWS now allows you to change the instance profile of a running instance, so the use case of ""a long-lived instance that's not in an instance profile"" no longer means you have to use the the EC2 auth method. You can now just change the instance profile on the fly.   Fix typo in aws auth cli help   Respond to PR feedback   More PR feedback   Respond to additional PR feedback   Address more feedback on aws auth PR   Make aws auth_type immutable per role   Address more aws auth PR feedback   Address more iam auth PR feedback   Rename aws-ec2.html.md to aws.html.md   Per PR feedback, to go along with new backend name.   Add MountType to logical.Request   Make default aws auth_type dependent upon MountType   When MountType is aws-ec2, default to ec2 auth_type for backwards compatibility with legacy roles. Otherwise, default to iam.  Pass MountPoint and MountType back up to the core  Previously the request router reset the MountPoint and MountType back to the empty string before returning to the core. This ensures they get set back to the correct values.",1

I think we can make the UX a little bit better by adding just a few words to the output: $ vault delete secret/foo Success!

This can not only cause Vault to cycle trying to revoke them, but it also prevents mounts from being unmounted, leaving them in a tainted state where the only operations allowed are to revoke (or rollback), which will never successfully complete. This adds a new endpoint that works similarly to revoke-prefix but ignores errors coming from a backend upon revocation (it does not ignore errors coming from within the expiration manager, such as errors accessing the data store). This can be used to force Vault to abandon leases. Like revoke-prefix, this is a very sensitive operation and requires sudo. It is implemented as a separate endpoint, rather than an argument to revoke-prefix, to ensure that control can be delegated appropriately, as even most administrators should not normally have this privilege.
