Not immediately clear is how we'd go about building a custom DNS validation mechanism that supported multiple resolvers. Likely we'd need to rely on meikg/dns and handle the resolution separately for each container and use a custom Dialer that assumes the address is already pre-resolved.

23,Add ACME revocation handlers (#20340)," Add ACME revocation handlers  This refactors path_revoke to expose Proof of Possession verification, which is reused by ACME to allow methods 1 and 2:  Revocation of a certificate issued by the account, using account     signature as sufficient proof. Revocation of a certificate via proving possession of its private     key, using this private key to create the JWS signature.  We do not support the third mechanism, completing challenges equivalent to those on the existing certificate and then performing a revocation under an account which didn't issue the certificate but which did solve those challenges. We additionally create another map account->cert->order, allowing us to quickly look up if a cert was issued by this particular account. Note that the inverse lookup of cert->(account, order) lookup isn't yet possible due to Vault's storage structure.

45,[QT-530] enos: allow-list all public IP addresses (#20304),"The security groups that allow access to remote machines in Enos scenarios have been configured to only allow port 22 (SSH) from the public IP address of machine executing the Enos scenario. To achieve this we previously utilized the enos_environment.public_ip_address attribute. Sometime in mid March we started seeing sporadic SSH i/o timeout errors when attempting to execute Enos resources against SSH transport targets. We've only ever seen this when communicating from Azure hosted runners to AWS hosted machines. While testing we were able to confirm that in some cases the public IP address resolved using DNS over UDP4 to Google and OpenDNS name servers did not match what was resolved when using the HTTPS/TCP IP address service hosted by AWS. The Enos data source was implemented in a way that we'd attempt resolution of a single name server and only attempt resolving from the next if previous name server could not get a result. We'd then allow-list that single IP address. That's a problem if we can resolve two different public IP addresses depending our endpoint address. This change utlizes the new enos_environment.public_ip_addresses attribute and subsequent behavior change. Now the data source will attempt to resolve our public IP address via name servers hosted by Google, OpenDNS, Cloudflare, and AWS. We then return a unique set of these IP addresses and allow-list all of them in our security group. It is our hope that this resolves these i/o timeout errors that seem like they're caused by the security group black-holing our attempted access because the IP we resolved does not match what we're actually exiting with.

As documented in the Go issue, this is not a valid assumption and thus causes OCSP verification to fail in Vault with an error like:  bad OCSP signature: crypto/rsa: verification error  which ultimately leads to a cert auth login error of:  no chain matching all constraints could be found for this login certificate  We address this by using the unsafe issuer=nil argument, taking on the task of validating the OCSP response's signature as best we can in the absence of full chain information on either side (both the trusted certificate whose OCSP response we're verifying and the lack of any additional certs the OCSP responder may have sent).

100,[QT-525] enos: use spot instances for Vault targets (#20037),"The previous strategy for provisioning infrastructure targets was to use the cheapest instances that could reliably perform as Vault cluster nodes. With this change we introduce a new model for target node infrastructure. We've replaced on-demand instances for a spot fleet. While the spot price fluctuates based on dynamic pricing,  capacity, region, instance type, and platform, cost savings for our most common combinations range between 20-70%. This change only includes spot fleet targets for Vault clusters. We'll be updating our Consul backend bidding in another PR.  Create a new vault_cluster module that handles installation,   configuration, initializing, and unsealing Vault clusters. Create a target_ec2_instances module that can provision a group of   instances on-demand. Create a target_ec2_spot_fleet module that can bid on a fleet of   spot instances. Extend every Enos scenario to utilize the spot fleet target acquisition   strategy and the vault_cluster module. Update our Enos CI modules to handle both the aws-nuke permissions   and also the privileges to provision spot fleets.

138,"Fix building unified delta WAL, unified delta CRLs (#20058)"," Correctly find certificates for unified delta CRL  When building the unified delta CRL, WAL entries from the non-primary cluster were ignored. This resulted in an incomplete delta CRL, preventing some entries from appearing. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Correctly rebuild unified delta CRLs  When deciding if the Unified Delta CRL should be rebuilt, we need to check the status of all clusters and their last revoked serial numbers. If any new serial has been revoked on any cluster, we should rebuild the unified delta CRLs. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Correctly persist Unified Delta CRL build entries  When building the unified CRL, we need to read the last seen serial number from all clusters, not just the present cluster, and write it to the last built serial for that cluster's unified delta WAL entry. This prevents us from continuously rebuilding unified CRLs now that we have fixed our rebuild heuristic. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix getLastWALSerial for unified delta CRLs  getLastWALSerial ignored its path argument, preventing it from reading the specified cluster-specific WAL entry. On the primary cluster, this was mostly equivalent, but now that we're correctly reading WAL entries and revocations for other clusters, we need to handle reading these entries correctly. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Copy delta WAL entries in event of failure  Any local delta WAL should be persisted to unified delta WAL space as well. If such unified persistence fails, we need to ensure that they get eventually moved up, otherwise they'll remain missing until the next full CRL rebuild occurs, which might be significantly longer than when the next delta CRL rebuild would otherwise occur. runUnifiedTransfer already handles this for us, but it lacked logic for delta WAL serials. The only interesting catch here is that we refuse to copy any entries whose full unified revocation entry has not also been written. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Make doUnifiedTransferMissingLocalSerials log an error  This message is mostly an error and would always be helpful information to have when troubleshooting failures. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Warn on cross-cluster write failures during revoke  When revoking certificates, we log cross-cluster revocation failures, but we should really expose this information to the caller, that their local revocation was successful, but their cross-cluster revocation failed. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Ensure unified delta WAL entry has full entry  Delta WAL entries are empty files whose only information (a revoked serial number) is contained in the file path. These depend implicitly on a full revocation entry existing for this file (whether a cross-cluster unified entry or a local entry).

Creating a new account.  One side effect of our JWS parsing logic is that we needed a way to differentiate between whether a JWK existed on disk from an account or if it was specified in the request. This technically means we're potentially responding to certain requests with positive results (e.g., key search based on kid) versus erring earlier like other implementations do.

247,Update pseudo-version for Secrets Terraform plugin (#19798),
248,Add mechanism to disable automatic rollbacks (#19748),"When testing the rollback mechanism, there's two categories of tests typically written:  Ones in which the rollback manager is entirely left alone, which     usually are a bit slower and less predictable. However, it is still     sufficient in many scenarios. Ones in which the rollback manager is explicitly probed by tests     and ""stepped"" to achieve the next rollback.  Here, without a mechanism to fully disable the rollback manager's periodic ticker (without affecting its ability to work!) we'll continue to see races of the sort:  --- FAIL: TestRevocationQueue (50.95s) panic: sync: WaitGroup is reused before previous Wait has returned [recovered]     panic: sync: WaitGroup is reused before previous Wait has returned   This allows us to disable the ticker, returning control to the test suite entirely.

I had to change the core.checkToken() to be publicly accessible, as it seems like the easiest way to check the token on the logical.Request against all relevant policies, but without going into all of the complex logic further in handleLogical().

We're going to fix this properly, running initCommands exactly once. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Prevent parallel testing racing in initCommands(...)  When running initCommands(...) from multiple tests, they can potentially race, causing a panic. Test callers needing to set formatting information must use RunCustom(...) instead of directly invoking the test backend directly. When using t.Parallel(...) in these top-level tests, we thus could race. This removes the Commands global variable, making it a local variable instead as nothing else appears to use it.

When generating the tidy status, we read the values of two backend atomics, b.certCount and b.revokedCertCount, without using the atomic load operation.

We also invoke initialize automatically on test Factory construction.

684,Add unified crl building (#18792)," Add unified CRL config storage helpers  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add support to build unified CRLs  This allows us to build unified versions of both the complete and delta CRLs. This mostly involved creating a new variant of the unified-specific CRL builder, fetching certs from each cluster's storage space. Unlike OCSP, here we do not unify the node's local storage with the cross-cluster storage: this node is the active of the performance primary, so writes to unified storage happen exactly the same as writes to cluster-local storage, meaning the two are always in sync. Other performance secondaries do not rebuild the CRL, and hence the out-of-sync avoidance that we'd like to solve with the OCSP responder is not necessary to solve here. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add ability to fetch unified CRLs  This adds to the path-fetch APIs the ability to return the unified CRLs. We update the If-Modified-Since infrastructure to support querying the unified CRL specific data and fetchCertBySerial to support all unified variants. This works for both the default/global fetch APIs and the issuer-specific fetch APIs.

Notably, this commit also changes us to not write Delta WALs when Delta CRLs is disabled (versus previously doing it when auto rebuild is enabled in case Delta CRLs were later asked for), and instead, triggering rebuilding a complete CRL so we don't need up-to-date Delta WAL info.

692,Add cross-cluster revocation queues for PKI (#18784)," Add global, cross-cluster revocation queue to PKI  This adds a global, cross-cluster replicated revocation queue, allowing operators to revoke certificates by serial number across any cluster. We don't support revoking with private key (PoP) in the initial implementation. In particular, building on the PBPWF work, we add a special storage location for handling non-local revocations which gets replicated up to the active, primary cluster node and back down to all secondary PR clusters. These then check the pending revocation entry and revoke the serial locally if it exists, writing a cross-cluster confirmation entry. Listing capabilities are present under pki/certs/revocation-queue, allowing operators to see which certs are present. However, a future improvement to the tidy subsystem will allow automatic cleanup of stale entries. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow tidying revocation queue entries  No manual operator control of revocation queue entries are allowed. However, entries are stored with their request time, allowing tidy to, after a suitable safety buffer, remove these unconfirmed and presumably invalid requests. Notably, when a cluster goes offline, it will be unable to process cross-cluster revocations for certificates it holds. If tidy runs, potentially valid revocations may be removed. However, it is up to the administrator to ensure the tidy window is sufficiently long that any required maintenance is done (or, prior to maintenance when an issue is first noticed, tidy is temporarily disabled). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Only allow enabling global revocation queue on Vault Enterprise  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Use a locking queue to handle revocation requests  This queue attempts to guarantee that PKI's invalidateFunc won't have to wait long to execute: by locking only around access to the queue proper, and internally using a list, we minimize the time spent locked, waiting for queue accesses.

Notably, these semantics are subject to change and shouldn't yet be relied on. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Collect paths for write forwarding in OSS  This adds a path manager to Core, allowing tracking across all Vault versions of paths which could use write forwarding if available. In particular, even on OSS offerings, we'll need to template {{clusterId}} into the paths, in the event of later upgrading to Enterprise. If we didn't, we'd end up writing paths which will no longer be accessible post-migration, due to write forwarding now replacing the sentinel with the actual cluster identifier.

715,OpenAPI generic_mount_paths follow-up (#18663)," OpenAPI generic_mount_paths follow-up  An incremental improvement within larger context discussed in #18560.   Following the revert in #18617, re-introduce the change from   {mountPath} to {<path-of-mount>_mount_path}; this is needed, as   otherwise paths from multiple plugins would clash - e.g. almost every   auth method would provide a conflicting definition for   auth/{mountPath}/login, and the last one written into the map would   win.   Move the half of the functionality that was in sdk/framework/ to   vault/logical_system.go with the rest; this is needed, as   sdk/framework/ gets compiled in to externally built plugins, and   therefore there may be version skew between it and the Vault main   code. Implementing the generic_mount_paths feature entirely on one   side of this boundary frees us from problems caused by this.   Update the special exception that recognizes system and identity   as singleton mounts to also include the other two singleton mounts,   cubbyhole and auth/token.   Include a comment that documents to restricted circumstances in which   the generic_mount_paths option makes sense to use: // Note that for this to actually be useful, you have to be using it with // a Vault instance in which you have mounted one of each secrets engine // and auth method of types you are interested in, at paths which identify // their type, and for the KV secrets engine you will probably want to // mount separate kv-v1 and kv-v2 mounts to include the documentation for // each of those APIs.

752,Add automated CI account cleanup & monitoring (#18659),"This uses aws-nuke and awslimitchecker to monitor the new vault CI account to clean up and prevent resource quota exhaustion.  AWS-nuke will scan all regions of the accounts for lingering resources enos/terraform didn't clean up, and if they don't match exclusion criteria, delete them every night.  By default, we exclude corp-sec created resources, our own CI resources, and when possible, anything created within the past 72 hours. Because this account is dedicated to CI, users should not expect resources to persist beyond this without additional configuration."
753,Add option 'elide_list_responses' to audit backends (#18128),"This PR relates to a feature request logged through HashiCorp commercial support. Vault lacks pagination in its APIs. As a result, certain list operations can return very large responses.  The user's chosen audit sinks may experience difficulty consuming audit records that swell to tens of megabytes of JSON. In our case, one of the systems consuming audit log data could not cope, and failed. The responses of list operations are typically not very interesting, as they are mostly lists of keys, or, even when they include a ""key_info"" field, are not returning confidential information. They become even less interesting once HMAC-ed by the audit system. Some example Vault ""list"" operations that are prone to becoming very large in an active Vault installation are: auth/token/accessors/ identity/entity/id/ identity/entity-alias/id/ pki/certs/  In response, I've coded a new option that can be applied to audit backends, elide_list_responses. When enabled, response data is elided from audit logs, only when the operation type is ""list"". For added safety, the elision only applies to the ""keys"" and ""key_info"" fields within the response data - these are conventionally the only fields present in a list response - see logical.ListResponse, and logical.ListResponseWithInfo. However, other fields are technically possible if a plugin author writes unusual code, and these will be preserved in the audit log even with this option enabled. The elision replaces the values of the ""keys"" and ""key_info"" fields with an integer count of the number of entries. This allows even the elided audit logs to still be useful for answering questions like ""Was any data returned?"" or ""How many records were listed?""."

758,Allow tidy to backup legacy CA bundles (#18645)," Allow tidy to backup legacy CA bundles  With the new tidy_move_legacy_ca_bundle option, we'll use tidy to move the legacy CA bundle from /config/ca_bundle to /config/ca_bundle.bak. This does two things:  Removes ca_bundle from the hot-path of initialization after initial     migration has completed. Because this entry is seal wrapped, this     may result in performance improvements. Allows recovery of this value in the event of some other failure     with migration.  Notably, this cannot occur during migration in the unlikely (and largely unsupported) case that the operator immediately downgrades to Vault <1.11.x. Thus, we reuse issuer_safety_buffer; while potentially long, tidy can always be run manually with a shorter buffer (and only this flag) to manually move the bundle if necessary. In the event of needing to recover or undo this operation, it is sufficient to use sys/raw to read the backed up value and subsequently write it to its old path (/config/ca_bundle). The new entry remains seal wrapped, but otherwise isn't used within the code and so has better performance characteristics. Performing a fat deletion (DELETE /root) will again remove the backup like the old legacy bundle, preserving its wipe characteristics.

869,[QT-436] Pseudo random artifact test scenarios (#18056),"Introducing a new approach to testing Vault artifacts before merge and after merge/notorization/signing. Rather than run a few static scenarios across the artifacts, we now have the ability to run a pseudo random sample of scenarios across many different build artifacts. We've added 20 possible scenarios for the AMD64 and ARM64 binary bundles, which we've broken into five test groups. On any given push to a pull request branch, we will now choose a random test group and execute its corresponding scenarios against the resulting build artifacts. This gives us greater test coverage but lets us split the verification across many different pull requests. The post-merge release testing pipeline behaves in a similar fashion, however, the artifacts that we use for testing have been notarized and signed prior to testing. We've also reduce the number of groups so that we run more scenarios after merge to a release branch. We intend to take what we've learned building this in Github Actions and roll it into an easier to use feature that is native to Enos. Until then, we'll have to manually add scenarios to each matrix file and manually number the test group. It's important to note that Github requires every matrix to include at least one vector, so every artifact that is being tested must include a single scenario in order for all workflows to pass and thus satisfy branch merge requirements.  Add support for different artifact types to enos-run Add support for different runner type to enos-run Add arm64 scenarios to build matrix Expand build matrices to include different variants Update Consul versions in Enos scenarios and matrices Refactor enos-run environment Add minimum version filtering support to enos-run. This allows us to   automatically exclude scenarios that require a more recent version of   Vault Add maximum version filtering support to enos-run. This allows us to   automatically exclude scenarios that require an older version of   Vault Fix Node 12 deprecation warnings Rename enos-verify-stable to enos-release-testing-oss Convert artifactory matrix into enos-release-testing-oss matrices Add all Vault editions to Enos scenario matrices Fix verify version with complex Vault edition metadata Rename the crt-builder to ci-helper Add more version helpers to ci-helper and Makefile Update CODEOWNERS for quality team Add support for filtering matrices by group and version constraints Add support for pseudo random test scenario execution  Signed-off-by: Ryan Cragun me@ryan.ec"

By extending /config/urls and its issuer counterpart to include an enable_templating parameter, we can allow operators to correctly identify the particular cluster a cert was issued on, and tie its AIA information to this (cluster, issuer) pair dynamically. Notably, this does not solve all usage issues around AIA URIs: the CRL and OCSP responder remain local, meaning that some merge capability is required prior to passing it to other systems if they use CRL files and must validate requests with certs from any arbitrary PR cluster.

Also switch some key locks to use DeadlockMutex to make it easier to discover deadlocks in testing. NewTestCluster also now starts the cluster, and the Start method becomes a no-op.  Unless SkipInit is provided, we also wait for a node to become active, eliminating the need for WaitForActiveNode.  This was needed because otherwise we can't safely make the quota api call.  We can't do it in Start because Start doesn't return an error, and I didn't want to begin storing the testing object T instead TestCluster just so we could call t.Fatal inside Start.  The last change here was to address the problem of how to skip setting up quotas when creating a cluster with a nonstandard handler that might not even implement the quotas endpoint.  The challenge is that because we were taking a func pointer to generate the real handler func, we didn't have any way to compare that func pointer to the standard handler-generating func http.Handler without creating a circular dependency between packages vault and http.  The solution was to pass a method instead of an anonymous func pointer so that we can do reflection on it."

This will be used with the PKI health check functionality, making both LIST and READ operations use ReadRaw, and optionally parsing the secret afterwards.

1030,[QT-358] Unify CRT and local builder workflows (#17766),"Here we make the following major changes:  Centralize CRT builder logic into a script utility so that we can share the   logic for building artifacts in CI or locally. Simplify the build workflow by calling a reusable workflow many times   instead of repeating the contents. Create a workflow that validates whether or not the build workflow and all   child workflows have succeeded to allow for merge protection.  Motivation  We need branch requirements for the build workflow and all subsequent   integration tests (QT-353) We need to ensure that the Enos local builder works (QT-558) Debugging build failures can be difficult because one has to hand craft the   steps to recreate the build Merge conflicts between Vault OSS and Vault ENT build workflows are quite   painful. As the build workflow must be the same file and name we'll reduce   what is contained in each that is unique. Implementations of building   will be unique per edition so we don't have to worry about conflict   resolution. Since we're going to be touching the build workflow to do the first two   items we might as well try and improve those other issues at the same time   to reduce the overhead of backports and conflicts.  Considerations  Build logic for Vault OSS and Vault ENT differs The Enos local builder was duplicating a lot of what we did in the CRT build   workflow Version and other artifact metadata has been an issue before. Debugging it   has been tedious and error prone. The build workflow is full of brittle copy and paste that is hard to   understand, especially for all of the release editions in Vault Enterprise Branch check requirements for workflows are incredibly painful to use for   workflows that are dynamic or change often. The required workflows have to be   configured in Github settings by administrators. They would also prevent us   from having simple docs PRs since required integration workflows always have   to run to satisfy branch requirements. Doormat credentials requirements that are coming will require us to modify   which event types trigger workflows. This changes those ahead of time since   we're doing so much to build workflow. The only noticeable impact will be   that the build workflow no longer runs on pushes to non-main or release   branches. In order to test other branches it requires a workflow_dispatch   from the Actions tab or a pull request.  Solutions  Centralize the logic that determines build metadata and creates releasable   Vault artifacts. Instead of cargo-culting logic multiple times in the build   workflow and the Enos local modules, we now have a crt-builder script which   determines build metadata and also handles building the UI, Vault, and the   package bundle. There are make targets for all of the available sub-commands.   Now what we use in the pipeline is the same thing as the local builder, and   it can be executed locally by developers. The crt-builder script works in OSS   and Enterprise so we will never have to deal with them being divergent or with   special casing things in the build workflow. Refactor the bulk of the Vault building into a reusable workflow that we can   call multiple times. This allows us to define Vault builds in a much simpler   manner and makes resolving merge conflicts much easier. Rather than trying to maintain a list and manually configure the branch check   requirements for build, we'll trigger a single workflow that uses the github   event system to determine if the build workflow (all of the sub-workflows   included) have passed. We'll then create branch restrictions on that single   workflow down the line.  Signed-off-by: Ryan Cragun me@ryan.ec"

The new solution in this PR is to add {mount_path} into every path with a default value specified: diff --    ""/auth/token/accessors/"": { ++    ""/auth/{mount_path}/accessors/"": {       ""parameters"": [         {           ""name"": ""mount_path"",           ""description"": ""...."",           ""in"": ""path"",           ""schema"": {             ""type"": ""string"", ++          ""default"": ""token""           }         }       ], Additionally, fixed the logic to generate the operationId (used to generate method names in the code generated from OpenAPI spec).

1047,Add automatic tidy of expired issuers (#17823)," Add automatic tidy of expired issuers  To aid PKI users like Consul, which periodically rotate intermediates, and provided a little more consistency with older versions of Vault which would silently (and dangerously!) replace the configured CA on root/intermediate generation, we introduce an automatic tidy of expired issuers. This includes a longer safety buffer (1 year) and logging of the relevant issuer information prior to deletion (certificate contents, key ID, and issuer ID/name) to allow admins to recover this value if desired, or perform further cleanup of keys. From my PoV, removal of the issuer is thus a relatively safe operation compared to keys (which I do not feel comfortable removing) as they can always be re-imported if desired. Additionally, this is an opt-in tidy operation, not enabled by default. Lastly, most major performance penalties comes with lots of issuers within the mount, not as much large numbers of keys (as only new issuer creation/import operations are affected, unlike LIST /issuers which is a public, unauthenticated endpoint).

1068,PKI - Fix order of chain building writes (#17772)," Ensure correct write ordering in rebuildIssuersChains  When troubleshooting a recent migration failure from 1.10->1.11, it was noted that some PKI mounts had bad chain construction despite having valid, chaining issuers. Due to the cluster's leadership trashing between nodes, the migration logic was re-executed several times, partially succeeding each time. While the legacy CA bundle migration logic was written with this in mind, one shortcoming in the chain building code lead us to truncate the ca_chain: by sorting the list of issuers after including non-written issuers (with random IDs), these issuers would occasionally be persisted prior to storage prior to existing CAs with modified chains. The migration code carefully imported the active issuer prior to its parents. However, due to this bug, there was a chance that, if write to the pending parent succeeded but updating the active issuer didn't, the active issuer's ca_chain field would only contain the self-reference and not the parent's reference as well. Ultimately, a workaround of setting and subsequently unsetting a manual chain would force a chain regeneration. In this patch, we simply fix the write ordering: because we need to ensure a stable chain sorting, we leave the sort location in the same place, but delay writing the provided referenceCert to the last position. This is because the reference is meant to be the user-facing action: without transactional write capabilities, other chains may succeed, but if the last user-facing action fails, the user will hopefully retry the action. This will also correct migration, by ensuring the subsequent issuer import will be attempted again, triggering another chain build and only persisting this issuer when all other issuers have also been updated. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remigrate ca_chains to fix any missing issuers  In the previous commit, we identified an issue that would occur on legacy issuer migration to the new storage format. This is easy enough to detect for any given mount (by an operator), but automating scanning and remediating all PKI mounts in large deployments might be difficult. Write a new storage migration version to regenerate all chains on upgrade, once.

Note, however, that running delve and other debuggers requires access to the full source code, which isn't provided for the Enterprise, HSM, etc. binaries, so it isn't possible to debug those anyway outside of people who have the full source.  panic traces vault debug error messages Despite what the documentation says, these flags do not delete the function symbol table (so it is not the same as having a stripped binary).

1078,Use hashicorp mirror for container pulls (#17778),"When running the test suite in CI (where requests are centralized from relatively few IPs), we'd occasionally hit Dockerhub's rate limits. Luckily Hashicorp runs a (limited) public mirror of the containers we need, so we can switch to them here in the tests. For consistency between developer and CI, we've opted to have the tests always pull from the Hashicorp mirror, rather than updating the CI runner to prefer the mirror.

1095,Vault Raw Read Support (CLI & Client)  (#14945)," Expose raw request from client.Logical()  Not all Vault API endpoints return well-formatted JSON objects. Sometimes, in the case of the PKI secrets engine, they're not even printable (/pki/ca returns a binary (DER-encoded) certificate). While this endpoint isn't authenticated, in general the API caller would either need to use Client.RawRequestWithContext(...) directly (which the docs advise against), or setup their own net/http client and re-create much of Client and/or Client.Logical. Instead, exposing the raw Request (via the new ReadRawWithData(...)) allows callers to directly consume these non-JSON endpoints like they would nearly any other endpoint. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add raw formatter for direct []byte data  As mentioned in the previous commit, some API endpoints return non-JSON data. We get as far as fetching this data (via client.Logical().Read), but parsing it as an api.Secret fails (as in this case, it is non-JSON). Given that we intend to update vault read to support such endpoints, we'll need a ""raw"" formatter that accepts []byte-encoded data and simply writes it to the UI. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add support for reading raw API endpoints  Some endpoints, such as pki/ca and pki/ca/pem return non-JSON objects. When calling vault read on these endpoints, an error is returned because they cannot be parsed as api.Secret instances:  Error reading pki/ca/pem: invalid character '-' in numeric literal  Indeed, we go to all the trouble of (successfully) fetching this value, only to be unable to Unmarshal into a Secrets value. Instead, add support for a new -format=raw option, allowing these endpoints to be consumed by callers of vault read directly.

On AEAD ciphers with a relevant factory, an AssociatedData factory will be used to populate the AdditionalData field of the SymmetricOpts struct, using it in the AEAD Seal process.

1128,[CI-only] Update RedHat registry tag (#17610)," [CI-only] Update RedHat registry tag  There are a few changes being made to RedHat's registry on October 20, 2022 that affect the way images need to be tagged prior to being pushed to the registry. This PR changes the tag to conform to the new standard.  We have other work queued up in crt-workflows-common and actions-docker-build to support the other required changes.  This PR should be merged to main and all release branches on or after October 20, 2022, and MUST be merged before your next production release. Otherwise, the automation to push to the RedHat registry will not work.  A detailed list of changes shared from RedHat (as an FYI): The following changes will occur for container certification projects that leverage the Red Hat hosted registry [registry.connect.redhat.com] for image distribution:   All currently published images are migrating to a NEW, Red Hat hosted quay registry. Partners do not have to do anything for this migration, and this will not impact customers. The registry will still utilize registry.connect.redhat.com as the registry URL.   The registry URL currently used to push, tag, and certify images, as well as the registry login key, will change. You can see these changes under the “Images” tab of the container certification project. You will now see a quay.io address and will no longer see scan.connect.redhat.com.   Partners will have the opportunity to auto-publish images by selecting “Auto-publish” in the Settings tab of your certification project. This will automatically publish images that pass all certification tests.   For new container image projects, partners will have the option to host within their own chosen image registry while using registry.connect.redhat.com as a proxy address. This means the end user can authenticate to the Red Hat registry to pull a partner image without having to provide additional authentication to the partner’s registry.   docker: update redhat_tag   Co-authored-by: Sam Salisbury samsalisbury@gmail.com"

This meant the identity template was only ever allowed to return a single principal. There are use cases where it would be helpful for identity metadata to contain a list of valid principals and for the identity template to be able to inject all of those as valid principals. This change inverts the order of processing. First the template is evaluated, and then the resulting string is split on commas. This allows the identity template to return a single comma-separated string with multiple permitted principals. There is a potential security implication here, that if a user is allowed to update their own identity metadata, they may be able to elevate privileges where previously this was not possible.

In particular, nominal requirements are placed on the structure on the issuer's Subject, which we supply, and the remaining requirements pass. The one exception is we include both RFC and CA/BF BR lints in the default zlint checks; this means ECDSA P-521 (which isn't accepted by Mozilla's root store policies) is rejected, so we ignore to lints related to that. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add options to copy to/from container, fix stopping  Stopping the container takes a bit of time for some unknown reason so I've instead opted to shorten the sleep in the zlint tests to avoid consuming resources too long after the test finish.

This is incorrect as the PR secondary nodes are the active node in the local PR cluster, and run tidy operations otherwise. This meant that while auto-tidy and tidy operations would run, there was no insight into the process.

For more information on the release, see: https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.2  Update Docker versions in CI to 20.10.17  After updating Vault to go version 1.19.2, there were several SIGABRTs in the vault tests.

When UseCSRValues is true (as is the case on the sign-verbatim endpoint), all extensions including Subject Alternative Names are copied from the CSR to the final certificate. If the Subject Alternative Name in question contains any othernames (such as a Microsoft UPN) the SAN extension is added again as a workaround for an encoding issue (in function HandleOtherSANs). Having duplicate x509v3 extensions is invalid and is rejected by openssl on Ubuntu 20.04, and also by Go since https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50988 (including in Go 1.19). In this fix I do not add the extension from the CSR if it will be added during HandleOtherSANs.  Added unittest and changelog entry."

At this time due to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45990 we    can't issue PSS signed CSRs, as the libraries in Go always request    a PKCS1v15. Add an extra check in intermediate/generate that validates the CSR's    signature before providing it back to the client in case we generated    a bad signature such as if an end-user used a GCP backed managed key    with a RSA PSS algorithm.  GCP ignores the requested signature type and always signs with the      key's algorithm which can lead to a CSR that says it is signed with      a PKCS1v15 algorithm but is actually a RSA PSS signature   Add cl   PR feedback "

1253,Write explicit -help output to stdout (#17308)," Write explicit -help output to stdout  Per the consensus of most programs, and mirroring the GNU Coding Standards for CLI design, when users request -help explicitly via the CLI, this should be written to stdout to allow paging of output. stderr is fine when an invalid usage triggers the help text however. In our case, mitchellh/cli helpfully adds a HelpWriter that we previously set to stderr explicitly. This writer is only called to print user-requested help text; it is not called on error cases (e.g., bad usage triggering additional help text to the user). Thus it should safely be settable to stdout, enabling pagers without additional redirects. Notably, we do have to set ErrorWriter as it defaults to initializing to the value of HelpWriter, which we want to set to stdout now, which is less useful.

1329,Don't race for CRL rebuilding capability check (#17185)," Don't race for CRL rebuilding capability check  Core has recently seen some data races during SystemView/replication updates between them and the PKI subsystem. This is because this SystemView access occurs outside of a request (during invalidation handling) and thus the proper lock isn't held. Because replication status cannot change within the lifetime of a plugin (and instead, if a node switches replication status, the entire plugin instance will be torn down and recreated), it is safe to cache this once, at plugin startup, and use it throughout its lifetime. Thus, we replace this SystemView access with a stored boolean variable computed ahead of time.

I've tested that this works with auth, database, and secrets plugin types, with the following logic to populate RunningVersion: If a plugin has a PluginVersion() method implemented, then that is used If not, and the plugin is built into the Vault binary, then the go.mod version is used Otherwise, the it will be the empty string. My apologies for the length of this PR.  Placeholder backend should be external  We use a placeholder backend (previously a framework.Backend) before a GRPC plugin is lazy-loaded. This makes us later think the plugin is a builtin plugin. So we added a placeholderBackend type that overrides the IsExternal() method so that later we know that the plugin is external, and don't give it a default builtin version."

When creating new networks (such as in CircleCI) or when running via Podman (which has its own set of network ranges), this initial config will no longer be applicable. We thus need to write a new config into the image; while we could do this by rebuilding a new image on top of the existing layers (provisioning our config), we then need to manage these changes and give hooks for the service setup to build it. Thus, post-startup modification is probably easier to execute in our case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com"

This operation is disabled by default (to avoid load on clusters which don't need tidy to be run) but can be enabled. In particular, a default tidy configuration is written (via /config/auto-tidy) which mirrors the options passed to /tidy. Two additional parameters, enabled and interval, are accepted, allowing auto-tidy to be enabled or disabled and controlling the interval (between successful tidy runs) to attempt auto-tidy. Notably, a manual execution of tidy will delay additional auto-tidy operations. Status is reported via the existing /tidy-status endpoint.

1465,Support for generating Delta CRLs (#16773)," Allow generation of up-to-date delta CRLs  While switching to periodic rebuilds of CRLs alleviates the constant rebuild pressure on Vault during times of high revocation, the CRL proper becomes stale. One response to this is to switch to OCSP, but not every system has support for this. Additionally, OCSP usually requires connectivity and isn't used to augment a pre-distributed CRL (and is instead used independently). By generating delta CRLs containing only new revocations, an existing CRL can be supplemented with newer revocations without requiring Vault to rebuild all complete CRLs. Admins can periodically fetch the delta CRL and add it to the existing CRL and applications should be able to support using serials from both. Because delta CRLs are emptied when the next complete CRL is rebuilt, it is important that applications fetch the delta CRL and correlate it to their complete CRL; if their complete CRL is older than the delta CRL's extension number, applications MUST fetch the newer complete CRL to ensure they have a correct combination. This modifies the revocation process and adds several new configuration options, controlling whether Delta CRLs are enabled and when we'll rebuild it.

1473,Let PKI tidy associate revoked certs with their issuers (#16871)," Refactor tidy steps into two separate helpers  This refactors the tidy go routine into two separate helpers, making it clear where the boundaries of each are: variables are passed into these method and concerns are separated. As more operations are rolled into tidy, we can continue adding more helpers as appropriate. Additionally, as we move to make auto-tidy occur, we can use these as points to hook into periodic tidying. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor revInfo checking to helper  This allows us to validate whether or not a revInfo entry contains a presently valid issuer, from the existing mapping. Coupled with the changeset to identify the issuer on revocation, we can begin adding capabilities to tidy to update this association, decreasing CRL build time and increasing the performance of OCSP. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor issuer fetching for revocation purposes  Revocation needs to gracefully handle using the old legacy cert bundle, so fetching issuers (and parsing them) needs to be done slightly differently than other places. Refactor this from revokeCert into a common helper that can be used by tidy. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow tidy to associate revoked certs, issuers  When revoking a certificate, we need to associate the issuer that signed its certificate back to the revInfo entry. Historically this was performed during CRL building (and still remains so), but when running without CRL building and with only OCSP, performance will degrade as the issuer needs to be found each time. Instead, allow the tidy operation to take over this role, allowing us to increase the performance of OCSP and CRL in this scenario, by decoupling issuer identification from CRL building in the ideal case.

1489,Cleanup changes around issuer revocation (#16874)," Refactor CRL tests to use /sys/mounts  Thanks Steve for the approach! This also address nits from Kit. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Skip CRL building steps when disabled  This skips a number of steps during CRL build when it is disabled (and forceNew is not set). In particular, we avoid fetching issuers, we avoid associating issuers with revocation entries (and building that in-memory mapping), making CRL building more efficient. This means that there'll again be very little overhead on clusters with the CRL disabled. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Prevent revoking roots from appearing on own CRLs  This change ensures that when marking a root as revoked, it no longer appears on its own CRL. Very few clients support this event (as generally only leaves/intermediates are checked for presence on a parent's CRL) and it is technically undefined behavior (if the root is revoked, its own CRL should be untrusted and thus including it on its own CRL isn't a safe/correct distribution channel). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Ensure stability of revInfo issuer identification  As mentioned by Kit, iterating through each revInfoEntry and associating the first issuer which matches it can cause churn when many (equivalent) issuers are in the system and issuers come and go (via CRLSigning usage, which has been modified in this release as well). Because we'd not include issuers without CRLSigning usage, we'd cause our verification helper, isRevInfoIssuerValid, to think the issuer ID is no longer value (when instead, it just lacks crlSigning bits). We address this by pulling in all issuers we know of for the identification. This allows us to keep valid-but-not-for-signing issuers, and use other representatives of their identity set for signing/building the CRL (if they are enabled for such usage). As a side effect, we now no longer place these entries on the default CRL in the event all issuers in the CRL set are without the usage.

1493,Identify issuer on revocation (#16763)," Identify issuer on revocation  When we attempt to revoke a leaf certificate, we already parse all of the issuers within the mount (to x509.Certificate) to ensure we don't accidentally revoke an issuer via the leaf revocation endpoint. We can reuse this information to associate the issuer (via issuer/subject comparison and signature checking) to the revoked cert in its revocation info. This will help OCSP, avoiding the case where the OCSP handler needs to associate a certificate to its issuer.

1494,Don't allow crl-signing issuer usage without CRLSign KeyUsage (#16865)," Allow correct importing of certs without CRL KU  When Vault imports certificates without KU for CRLSign, we shouldn't provision CRLUsage on the backing issuer; otherwise, we'll attempt to build CRLs and Go will cause us to err out. This change makes it clear (at issuer configuration time) that we can't possibly support this operation and hopefully prevent users from running into the more cryptic Go error. Note that this does not apply for OCSP EKU: the EKU exists, per RFC 6960 Section 2.6 OCSP Signature Authority Delegation, to allow delegation of OCSP signing to a child certificate. This EKU is not necessary on the issuer itself, and generally assumes issuers are allowed to issue OCSP responses regardless of KU/EKU.

1510,"Enable periodic, automatic rebuilding of CRLs (#16762)"," Allow automatic rebuilding of CRLs  When enabled, periodic rebuilding of CRLs will improve PKI mounts in two way:  Reduced load during periods of high (new) revocations, as the CRL     isn't rebuilt after each revocation but instead on a fixed schedule. Ensuring the CRL is never stale as long as the cluster remains up,     by checking for next CRL expiry and regenerating CRLs before that     happens. This may increase cluster load when operators have large     CRLs that they'd prefer to let go stale, rather than regenerating     fresh copies.  In particular, we set a grace period before expiration of CRLs where, when the periodic function triggers (about once a minute), we check upcoming CRL expirations and check if we need to rebuild the CRLs.

This allows callers to revoke certificate they own (as proven by holding the corresponding private key), without having an admin create innumerable ACLs around the serial_number parameter for every issuance/user. We base this on Go TLS stack's verification of certificate<->key matching, but extend it where applicable to ensure curves match, the private key is indeed valid, and has the same structure as the corresponding public key from the certificate. This endpoint currently is authenticated, allowing operators to disable the endpoint if it isn't desirable to use, via ACL policies.

In particular, Vault verifies the signature on the certificate from an existing issuer within the mount, ensuring that one indeed issued this certificate. The certificate is then added to storage and its serial submitted for revocation. This allows certificates generated with no_store=true to be submitted for revocation afterwards, given a full copy of the certificate. As a consequence, all roles can now safely move to no_store=true (if desired for performance) and revocation can be done on a case-by-case basis.

This is because the SignatureAlgorithm value from the certificate itself is incorrect for this purpose: a RSA root could sign an ECDSA intermediate with say, SHA256WithRSA, but when the intermediate goes to sign a CRL, it must use ECDSAWithSHA256 or equivalent instead of SHA256WithRSA. When coupled with support for PSS-only keys, allowing the user to set the signature algorithm value as desired seems like the best approach.

This results in CRL building failing, unless we update the entry's signature algorithm prior to building the CRL for the new root. With a RSA-type key and use_pss=true, we use the signature bits value to decide which hash function to use for PSS support. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add clearer error message on failed import  When CRL building fails during cert/key import, due to PSS failures, give a better indication to the user that import succeeded its just CRL building that failed.

1619,Allow old certs to be cross-signed (#16494)," Allow old certs to be cross-signed  In Vault 1.11, we introduced cross-signing support, but the earlier SKID field change in Vault 1.10 causes problems: notably, certs created on older versions of Vault (<=1.9) or outside of Vault (with a different SKID method) cannot be cross-signed and validated in OpenSSL. In particular, OpenSSL appears to be unique in requiring a SKID/AKID match for chain building. If AKID and SKID are present on an otherwise valid client/parent cert pair and the values are different, OpenSSL will not build a valid path over those two, whereas most other chain validation implementations will. Regardless, to have proper cross-signing support, we really aught to support copying an SKID. This adds such support to the sign-intermediate endpoint. Support for the /issue endpoint is not added, as cross-signing leaf certs isn't generally useful and can accept random SKIDs.

1628,Make PKI tests run in parallel (#16514),"This decreases the total time to run the test suite significantly. From the last PR, we were at 151s:  [cipherboy@xps15 pki]$ go test -count=1 github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki ok    github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki  151.182s  Now we're around 60s:  [cipherboy@xps15 pki]$ go test -count=1 github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki ok    github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki  61.838s  Notably, Go will correctly handle parallelizing tests across both packages and within a package, so this shouldn't really impact test runners (if they're already saturated). The only gotcha in this approach is that the call to t.Run(...) becomes effectively async; this means we either need to not mark the test as parallel or shadow any loop variables inside the scope of the loop to allow the t.Run to have the correct copy.

1661,Agent JWT auto auth remove_jwt_after_reading config option (#11969),"Add a new config option for Vault Agent's JWT auto auth remove_jwt_after_reading, which defaults to true. Can stop Agent from attempting to delete the file, which is useful in k8s where the service account JWT is mounted as a read-only file and so any attempt to delete it generates spammy error logs. When leaving the JWT file in place, the read period for new tokens is 1 minute instead of 500ms to reflect the assumption that there will always be a file there, so finding a file does not provide any signal that it needs to be re-read. Kubernetes has a minimum TTL of 10 minutes for tokens, so a period of 1 minute gives Agent plenty of time to detect new tokens, without leaving it too unresponsive. We may want to add a config option to override these default periods in the future. Co-authored-by: Tom Proctor tomhjp@users.noreply.github.com"

We rely on the seal to manage trust.  It’s possible to use multiple join requests to switch nodes from voter to non-voter. The screenshot shows a 3 node cluster where vault_2 is the leader, and vault_3 and vault_4 are followers with non-voters set to false.  sent two requests to the raft join endpoint to have vault_3 and vault_4 join the cluster with non_voters:true.  This commit fixes the issue by delaying the call to SetDesiredSuffrage until after the initialization check, preventing unauthenticated mangling of voter status. Tested locally using https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-tools/blob/main/users/ncabatoff/cluster/raft.sh and the reproducer outlined in VAULT-6773.  raft: Return join err on failure  This is necessary to correctly distinguish errors returned from the Join workflow. Previously, errors were being masked as timeouts.  raft: Default autopilot parameters in teststorage  Change some defaults so we don't have to pass in parameters or set them in the originating tests. These storage types are only used in two places: 1) Raft HA testing 2) Seal migration testing Both consumers have been tested and pass with this change.  changelog: Unauthn voter status change bugfix"

When the issuer lacked a key (such as the root issuer on an intermediate mount), this signing bundle creation failed. Instead of fetching the full CA signing bundle, fetch instead the raw certutil.CertBundle and parse it (to x509.Certificate form) ourselves.

Operators can restrict roles to just a single option (e.g., for email certs, limit CNs to have strictly email addresses and not hostnames). By setting the value to disabled, CNs of other formats can be accepted without validating their contents against our minimal correctness checks for email/hostname/wildcard that we typically apply even when broad permissions (allow_any_name=true, enforce_hostnames=false, and allow_wildcard_certificates=true) are granted on the role.

2006,Fix handling of username_as_alias during LDAP authentication (#15525)," Fix handling of username_as_alias during LDAP authentication  There is a bug that was introduced in the LDAP authentication method by https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/11000. It was thought to be backward compatible but has broken a number of users. Later a new parameter username_as_alias was introduced in https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/14324 to make it possible for operators to restore the previous behavior. The way it is currently working is not completely backward compatible thought because when username_as_alias is set, a call to GetUserAliasAttributeValue() will first be made, then this value is completely discarded in pathLogin() and replaced by the username as expected. This is an issue because it makes useless calls to the LDAP server and will break backward compatibility if one of the constraints in GetUserAliasAttributeValue() is not respected, even though the resulting value will be discarded anyway. In order to maintain backward compatibility here we have to only call GetUserAliasAttributeValue() if necessary. Since this change of behavior was introduced in 1.9, this fix will need to be backported to the 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches.

2041,Vault CLI: show detailed information with ListResponseWithInfo (#15417)," CLI: Add ability to display ListResponseWithInfos  The Vault Server API includes a ListResponseWithInfo call, allowing LIST responses to contain additional information about their keys. This is in a key=value mapping format (both for each key, to get the additional metadata, as well as within each metadata). Expand the vault list CLI command with a -detailed flag (and env var VAULT_DETAILED_LISTS) to print this additional metadata. This looks roughly like the following: $ vault list -detailed pki/issuers Keys                                    issuer_name ----                                    ----------- 0cba84d7-bbbe-836a-4ff6-a11b31dc0fb7    n/a 35dfb02d-0cdb-3d35-ee64-d0cd6568c6b0    n/a 382fad1e-e99c-9c54-e147-bb1faa8033d3    n/a 8bb4a793-2ad9-460c-9fa8-574c84a981f7    n/a 8bd231d7-20e2-f21f-ae1a-7aa3319715e7    n/a 9425d51f-cb81-426d-d6ad-5147d092094e    n/a ae679732-b497-ab0d-3220-806a2b9d81ed    n/a c5a44a1f-2ae4-2140-3acf-74b2609448cc    utf8 d41d2419-efce-0e36-c96b-e91179a24dc1    something  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow detailed printing of LIST responses in JSON  When using the JSON formatter, only the absolute list of keys were returned.

2045,Protect against key and issuer name re-use (#15481)," Protect against key and issuer name re-use While importing keys and issuers verify that the provided name if any has not been used by another key that we did not match against. Validate an assumption within the key import api, that we were provided a single key  Add additional tests on the new key generation and key import handlers.   Protect key import api end-users from using ""default"" as a name   Do not allow end-users to provide the value of default as a name for key imports    as that would lead to weird and wonderful behaviors to the end-user.

2046,Warn on empty Subject field for issuers (#15494)," Warn on empty Subject field for issuers  When generating a root or signing an intermediate certificate, it is possible to have Vault generate a certificate with an empty Subject. These don't validate in most TLS implementations well, so add a warning. Note that non-Common Name fields could be present to make a non-empty subject, so simply requiring a CommonName isn't strictly the best. For example: $ vault write pki/root/generate/exported common_name="""" WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:   * This issuer certificate was generated without a Subject; this makes   it likely that issuing leaf certs with this certificate will cause TLS   validation libraries to reject this certificate. ....

2047,Remove signature_bits on intermediate generate (#15478)," Remove signature_bits on intermediate generate  This extraneous field wasn't respected during intermediate generation and it isn't clear that it should be. Strictly, this field, if it were to exist, would control the CSR's internal signature algorithm (certutil defaults to the sane SHA-256 here). However, there's little value in changing this as the signing authority can and probably will override the final certificate's signature bits value, completely ignoring whatever was in the provided CSR. Removing this field will now cause warnings for those providing the parameter (which already wasn't respected), which is the desired behavior. No breakage should occur as a result of this change.

2111,Benchmark chain building (#15315)," Refactor chain building test cases to be shared  This will allow us to execute these test cases and then benchmark just the chain building, separate from the certificate creation (and without the consistency tests). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Benchmark chain building code  Using the existing test cases (and a few special ones), generate some simple chains and benchmark how long chain building takes. We switch from generating a cluster (slow) to directly calling createBackendWithStorage(), which improves test execution time too: $ go test -count=1 -run=Test_CAChainBuilding github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki ok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/builtin/logical/pki  0.764s (previously it was 5-10 seconds, for fewer tests).

2115,Use Get lookup within PKI resolveXXX functions instead of list iterations (#15322), Leverage a Get lookup operation to see if our reference field is a UUID    instead of listing all key/issuers and iterating over the list. This should be faster and we get a cached lookup possibly if it was a    UUID entry that we previously loaded. Address some small feedback about migration wording as well.
2116,Root issuers lack CA Chain + Chain Building Bug Fix (#15306),"  Return the ca_chain response from root issued cert api   Fix parent selection in cert chain building   When building chains, we'd choose the next neighbor from Go's unordered map. However, this doesn't necessarily result in the most optimal path: we want to prefer to visit roots over other intermediates, as this allows us to have a more consistent chain, putting roots before their cross-signed equivalents rather than potentially at the end. We additionally now ensure chains are stable. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Co-authored-by: Steve Clark steven.clark@hashicorp.com"
2117,Add parameter validation to the new generate key PKI api (#15319), Validate the key_type and key_bits arguments that were provided and    perform the same default processing of 0 as we used to do for the    generateRoot/generateIntermediate apis Add a test that validates the behaviour Update the field description blurbs.
2118,"Compare issuer certificates using cert, signature algo and signature fields (#15285)","  Move existing test helpers into a new test_helpers.go file within PKI   Compare issuer certificates by cert, signature algo and signature   Instead of comparing the strings of a certificate, instead leverage    the Go Raw attribute within a parsed certificate to compare. The Raw    attribute is a byte array of an ASN.1 DER containing the cert,    signature algo and signature.  Rework a bit of the importIssuers function as well to fail checks on the    inbound issuer earlier as well as load keys/issuers just before we need    them"
2119,Prevent revoking all issuer certificates (#15289)," Prevent revocation of issuers using revokeCert  Similar to the existing behavior, we'll prevent the revocation of existing issuer certificates from the existing /revoke/:serial endpoint for now. This is because a serial number alone is not enough information (in the worst case) to precisely identify an issuer (as intermediates signed by two separate external (e.g., OpenSSL) CAs using incremental serial numbers might have the same serial number). Additionally, we fix revoking certs on performance secondary clusters, when they've not yet been migrated. In a separate change, we'll open up a separate code path to revoke issuers, ensuring we know exactly which issuer is revoked (and which CRL it should belong on at time of revocation). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add warning when revoking expired cert  This prevents confusion when a nil response (with no revocation info) is returned; requesters are informed that the specified certificate has already expired.

2122,Allow Multiple Issuers in PKI Secret Engine Mounts - PKI Pod (#15277),"  Starter PKI CA Storage API (#14796)   Simple starting PKI storage api for CA rotation  Add key and issuer storage apis Add listKeys and listIssuers storage implementations  Add simple keys and issuers configuration storage api methods   Handle resolving key, issuer references   The API context will usually have a user-specified reference to the key. This is either the literal string ""default"" to select the default key, an identifier of the key, or a slug name for the key. Here, we wish to resolve this reference to an actual identifier that can be understood by storage. Also adds the missing Name field to keys. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add method to fetch an issuer's cert bundle  This adds a method to construct a certutil.CertBundle from the specified issuer identifier, optionally loading its corresponding key for signing. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor certutil PrivateKey PEM handling  This refactors the parsing of PrivateKeys from PEM blobs into shared methods (ParsePEMKey, ParseDERKey) that can be reused by the existing Bundle parsing logic (ParsePEMBundle) or independently in the new issuers/key-based PKI storage code. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add importKey, importCert to PKI storage  importKey is generally preferable to the low-level writeKey for adding new entries. This takes only the contents of the private key (as a string -- so a PEM bundle or a managed key handle) and checks if it already exists in the storage. If it does, it returns the existing key instance. Otherwise, we create a new one. In the process, we detect any issuers using this key and link them back to the new key entry. The same holds for importCert over importKey, with the note that keys are not modified when importing certificates. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for importing issuers, keys  This adds tests for importing keys and issuers into the new storage layout, ensuring that identifiers are correctly inferred and linked. Note that directly writing entries to storage (writeKey/writeissuer) will take KeyID links from the parent entry and should not be used for import; only existing entries should be updated with this info. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Implement PKI storage migration.   Hook into the backend::initialize function, calling the migration on a primary only.   Migrate an existing certificate bundle to the new issuers and key layout   Make fetchCAInfo aware of new storage layout   This allows fetchCAInfo to fetch a specified issuer, via a reference parameter provided by the user. We pass that into the storage layer and have it return a cert bundle for us. Finally, we need to validate that it truly has the key desired. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Begin /issuers API endpoints  This implements the fetch operations around issuers in the PKI Secrets Engine. We implement the following operations:  LIST /issuers - returns a list of known issuers' IDs and names. GET /issuer/:ref - returns a JSON blob with information about this    issuer. POST /issuer/:ref - allows configuring information about issuers,    presently just its name. DELETE /issuer/:ref - allows deleting the specified issuer. GET /issuer/:ref/{der,pem} - returns a raw API response with just    the DER (or PEM) of the issuer's certificate.  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add import to PKI Issuers API  This adds the two core import code paths to the API: /issuers/import/cert and /issuers/import/bundle. The former differs from the latter in that the latter allows the import of keys. This allows operators to restrict importing of keys to privileged roles, while allowing more operators permission to import additional certificates (not used for signing, but instead for path/chain building). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-intermediate endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to sign intermediate CA certificates. In the process, we've updated the existing /root/sign-intermediate endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/default/sign-intermediate. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-self-issued endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to sign self-signed certificates. In the process, we've updated the existing /root/sign-self-issued endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/default/sign-self-issued. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/sign-verbatim endpoint  This endpoint allows existing issuers to be used to directly sign CSRs. In the process, we've updated the existing /sign-verbatim endpoint to be equivalent to a call to /issuer/:ref/sign-verbatim. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow configuration of default issuers  Using the new updateDefaultIssuerId(...) from the storage migration PR allows for easy implementation of configuring the default issuer. We restrict callers from setting blank defaults and setting default to default. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix fetching default issuers  After setting a default issuer, one should be able to use the old /ca, /ca_chain, and /cert/{ca,ca_chain} endpoints to fetch the default issuer (and its chain). Update the fetchCertBySerial helper to no longer support fetching the ca and prefer fetchCAInfo for that instead (as we've already updated that to support fetching the new issuer location). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add /issuer/:ref/{sign,issue}/:role  This updates the /sign and /issue endpoints, allowing them to take the default issuer (if none is provided by a role) and adding issuer-specific versions of them. Note that at this point in time, the behavior isn't yet ideal (as /sign/:role allows adding the ref=... parameter to override the default issuer); a later change adding role-based issuer specification will fix this incorrect behavior. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Add support root issuer generation   Add support for issuer generate intermediate end-point   Update issuer and key arguments to consistent values   Update all new API endpoints to use the new agreed upon argument names.  issuer_ref & key_ref to refer to existing issuer_name & key_name for new definitions  Update returned values to always user issuer_id and key_id   Add utility methods to fetch common ref and name arguments   Add utility methods to fetch the issuer_name, issuer_ref, key_name and key_ref arguments from data fields.

Move setting PKI defaults from writeCaBundle to proper import{keys,issuer} methods   PR feedback, move setting up the default configuration references within    the import methods instead of within the writeCaBundle method. This should    now cover all use cases of us setting up the defaults properly.   Introduce constants for issuer_ref, rename isKeyDefaultSet...   Fix legacy PKI sign-verbatim api path   Addresses some test failures due to an incorrect refactoring of a legacy api    path /sign-verbatim within PKI   Use import code to handle intermediate, config/ca   The existing bundle import code will satisfy the intermediate import; use it instead of the old ca_bundle import logic. Additionally, update /config/ca to use the new import code as well. While testing, a panic was discovered:  reflect.Value.SetMapIndex: value of type string is not assignable to type pki.keyId  This was caused by returning a map with type issuerId->keyId; instead switch to returning string->string maps so the audit log can properly HMAC them. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Clarify error message on missing defaults  When the default issuer and key are missing (and haven't yet been specified), we should clarify that error message. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update test semantics for new changes  This makes two minor changes to the existing test suite:  Importing partial bundles should now succeed, where they'd     previously error. fetchCertBySerial no longer handles CA certificates.  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add support for deleting all keys, issuers  The old DELETE /root code must now delete all keys and issuers for backwards compatibility. We strongly suggest calling individual delete methods (DELETE /key/:key_ref or DELETE /issuer/:issuer_ref) instead, for finer control. In the process, we detect whether the deleted key/issuers was set as the default. This will allow us to warn (from the single key/deletion issuer code) whether or not the default was deleted (while allowing the operation to succeed). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Introduce defaultRef constant within PKI   Replace hardcoded ""default"" references with a constant to easily identify various usages.   Use the addIssuerRefField function instead of redefining the field in various locations.   Rework PKI test TestBackend_Root_Idempotency   Validate that generate/root calls are no longer idempotent, but the bundle importing    does not generate new keys/issuers  As before make sure that the delete root api resets everything  Address a bug within the storage that we bombed when we had multiple different    key types within storage.   Assign Name=current to migrated key and issuer   Detail I missed from the RFC was to assign the Name field as ""current"" for migrated key and issuer.   Build CRL upon PKI intermediary set-signed api called   Add a call to buildCRL if we created an issuer within pathImportIssuers  Augment existing FullCAChain to verify we have a proper CRL post set-signed api call  Remove a code block writing out ""ca"" storage entry that is no longer used.   Identify which certificate or key failed   When importing complex chains, we should identify in which certificate or key the failure occurred. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   PKI migration writes out empty migration log entry   Since the elements of the struct were not exported we serialized an empty    migration log to disk and would re-run the migration   Add chain-building logic to PKI issuers path   With the one-entry-per-issuer approach, CA Chains become implicitly constructed from the pool of issuers. This roughly matches the existing expectations from /config/ca (wherein a chain could be provided) and /intemediate/set-signed (where a chain may be provided). However, in both of those cases, we simply accepted a chain. Here, we need to be able to reconstruct the chain from parts on disk. However, with potential rotation of roots, we need to be aware of disparate chains. Simply concating together all issuers isn't sufficient. Thus we need to be able to parse a certificate's Issuer and Subject field and reconstruct valid (and potentially parallel) parent<->child mappings. This attempts to handle roots, intermediates, cross-signed intermediates, cross-signed roots, and rotated keys (wherein one might not have a valid signature due to changed key material with the same subject). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Return CA Chain when fetching issuers  This returns the CA Chain attribute of an issuer, showing its computed chain based on other issuers in the database, when fetching a specific issuer. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add testing for chain building  Using the issuance infrastructure, we generate new certificates (either roots or intermediates), positing that this is roughly equivalent to importing an external bundle (minus error handling during partial imports). This allows us to incrementally construct complex chains, creating reissuance cliques and cross-signing cycles. By using ECDSA certificates, we avoid high signature verification and key generation times. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow manual construction of issuer chain  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix handling of duplicate names  With the new issuer field (manual_chain), we can no longer err when a name already exists: we might be updating the existing issuer (with the same name), but changing its manual_chain field. Detect this error and correctly handle it. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for manual chain building  We break the clique, instead building these chains manually, ensuring that the remaining chains do not change and only the modified certs change. We then reset them (back to implicit chain building) and ensure we get the same results as earlier. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add stricter verification of issuers PEM format  This ensures each issuer is only a single certificate entry (as validated by count and parsing) without any trailing data. We further ensure that each certificate PEM has leading and trailing spaces removed with only a single trailing new line remaining. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix full chain building  Don't set the legacy IssuingCA field on the certificate bundle, as we prefer the CAChain field over it. Additionally, building the full chain could result in duplicate certificates when the CAChain included the leaf certificate itself. When building the full chain, ensure we don't include the bundle's certificate twice. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add stricter tests for full chain construction  We wish to ensure that each desired certificate in the chain is only present once.

If no CRL is found (matching a cert), we'll place it on the default CRL. However, in the event of equivalent issuers (those with the same subject AND the same key  material) -- perhaps due to reissuance -- we'll only create a single (unified) CRL for them. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow fetching updated CRL locations  This updates fetchCertBySerial to support querying the default issuer's CRL. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove legacy CRL storage location test case  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update to CRLv2 Format to copy RawIssuer  When using the older Certificate.CreateCRL(...) call, Go's x509 library copies the parsed pkix.Name version of the CRL Issuer's Subject field. For certain constructed CAs, this fails since pkix.Name is not suitable for round-tripping. This also builds a CRLv1 (per RFC 5280) CRL. In updating to the newer x509.CreateRevocationList(...) call, we can construct the CRL in the CRLv2 format and correctly copy the issuer's name. However, this requires holding an additional field per-CRL, the CRLNumber field, which is required in Go's implementation of CRLv2 (though OPTIONAL in the spec). We store this on the new LocalCRLConfigEntry object, per-CRL.

Add ability to read legacy cert bundle if the migration has not occurred on secondaries.   Track the migration state forbidding an issuer/key writing api call if we have not migrated  For operations that just need to read the CA bundle, use the same tracking variable to    switch between reading the legacy bundle or use the new key/issuer storage.  Add an invalidation function that will listen for updates to our log path to refresh the state    on secondary clusters.   Always write migration entry to trigger secondary clusters to wake up   Some PR feedback and handle a case in which the primary cluster does    not have a CA bundle within storage but somehow a secondary does.   Update CA Chain to report entire chain   This merges the ca_chain JSON field (of the /certs/ca_chain path) with the regular certificate field, returning the root of trust always. This also affects the non-JSON (raw) endpoints as well. We return the default issuer's chain here, rather than all known issuers (as that may not form a strict chain). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Allow explicit issuer override on roles  When a role is used to generate a certificate (such as with the sign/ and issue/ legacy paths or the legacy sign-verbatim/ paths), we prefer that issuer to the one on the request. This allows operators to set an issuer (other than default) for requests to be issued against, effectively making the change no different from the users' perspective as it is ""just"" a different role name. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add tests for role-based issuer selection  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Expand NotAfter limit enforcement behavior  Vault previously strictly enforced NotAfter/ttl values on certificate requests, erring if the requested TTL extended past the NotAfter date of the issuer. In the event of issuing an intermediate, this behavior was ignored, instead permitting the issuance. Users generally do not think to check their issuer's NotAfter date when requesting a certificate; thus this behavior was generally surprising. Per RFC 5280 however, issuers need to maintain status information throughout the life cycle of the issued cert. If this leaf cert were to be issued for a longer duration than the parent issuer, the CA must still maintain revocation information past its expiration. Thus, we add an option to the issuer to change the desired behavior:  err, to err out, permit, to permit the longer NotAfter date, or truncate, to silently truncate the expiration to the issuer's    NotAfter date.  Since expiration of certificates in the system's trust store are not generally validated (when validating an arbitrary leaf, e.g., during TLS validation), permit should generally only be used in that case. However, browsers usually validate intermediate's validity periods, and thus truncate should likely be used (as with permit, the leaf's chain will not validate towards the end of the issuance period).

Anywhere writes are handled (that should be propagated to all nodes in all clusters), we choose to forward the request all the way up to the performance primary cluster's primary node.

Add alternative proposal PKI aliased paths (#15211)   Add aliased path for root/rotate/:exported   This adds a user-friendly path name for generating a rotated root. We automatically choose the name ""next"" for the newly generated root at this path if it doesn't already exist. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add aliased path for intermediate/cross-sign  This allows cross-signatures to work. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add path for replacing the current root  This updates default to point to the value of the issuer with name ""next"" rather than its current value. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove plural issuers/ in signing paths  These paths use a single issuer and thus shouldn't include the plural issuers/ as a path prefix, instead using the singular issuer/ path prefix. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Only warn if default issuer was imported  When the default issuer was not (re-)imported, we'd fail to find it, causing an extraneous warning about missing keys, even though this issuer indeed had a key. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add missing issuer sign/issue paths  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Clean up various warnings within the PKI package (#15230)   Rebuild CRLs on secondary performance clusters post migration and on new/updated issuers   Hook into the backend invalidation function so that secondaries are notified of    new/updated issuer or migrations occuring on the primary cluster. Upon notification    schedule a CRL rebuild to take place upon the next process to read/update the CRL    or within the periodic function if no request comes in.   Schedule rebuilding PKI CRLs on active nodes only   Address an issue that we were scheduling the rebuilding of a CRL on standby    nodes, which would not be able to write to storage.   Fix an issue with standby nodes not correctly determining that a migration previously    occurred.   Return legacy CRL storage path when no migration has occurred.   Handle issuer, keys locking (#15227)   Handle locking of issuers during writes   We need a write lock around writes to ensure serialization of modifications. We use a single lock for both issuer and key updates, in part because certain operations (like deletion) will potentially affect both. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add missing b.useLegacyBundleCaStorage guards  Several locations needed to guard against early usage of the new issuers endpoint pre-migration. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com   Address PKI to properly support managed keys (#15256)   Address codebase for managed key fixes  Add proper public key comparison for better managed key support to importKeys  Remove redundant public key fetching within PKI importKeys   Correctly handle rebuilding remaining chains   When deleting a specific issuer, we might impact the chains. From a consistency perspective, we need to ensure the remaining chains are correct and don't refer to the since-deleted issuer, so trigger a full rebuild here. We don't need to call this in the delete-the-world (DELETE /root) code path, as there shouldn't be any remaining issuers or chains to build. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove legacy CRL bundle on world deletion  When calling DELETE /root, we should remove the legacy CRL bundle, since we're deleting the legacy CA issuer bundle as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove deleted issuers' CRL entries  Since CRLs are no longer resolvable after deletion (due to missing issuer ID, which will cause resolution to fail regardless of if an ID or a name/default reference was used), we should delete these CRLs from storage to avoid leaking them. In the event that this issuer comes back (with key material), we can simply rebuild the CRL at that time (from the remaining revoked storage entries). Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add unauthed JSON fetching of CRLs, Issuers (#15253)  Default to fetching JSON CRL for consistency This makes the bare issuer-specific CRL fetching endpoint return the JSON-wrapped CRL by default, moving the DER CRL to a specific endpoint. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add JSON-specific endpoint for fetching issuers Unlike the unqualified /issuer/:ref endpoint (which also returns JSON), we have a separate /issuer/:ref/json endpoint to return only the PEM-encoded certificate and the chain, mirroring the existing /cert/ca endpoint but for a specific issuer. This allows us to make the endpoint unauthenticated, whereas the bare endpoint would remain authenticated and usually privileged. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com Add tests for raw JSON endpoints Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add unauthenticated issuers endpoints to PKI table  This adds the unauthenticated issuers endpoints?  LIST /issuers, Fetching just the issuer certificates (in JSON/DER/PEM form), and Fetching the CRL of this issuer (in JSON/DER/PEM form).  Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add issuer usage restrictions bitset  This allows issuers to have usage restrictions, limiting whether they can be used to issue certificates or if they can generate CRLs. This allows certain issuers to not generate a CRL (if the global config is with the CRL enabled) or allows the issuer to not issue new certificates (but potentially letting the CRL generation continue). Setting both fields to false effectively forms a soft delete capability.

So preparing our queries does not really accomplish anything, and can have severe performance impacts (see https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-database-snowflake/issues/13 for example). This behavior seems to have been copy-pasted for many years but not for any particular reason that we have been able to find. First use was in https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/15 So here we switch to new methods suffixed with Direct to indicate that they don't Prepare before running Exec, and switch everything here to use those. We maintain the older methods with the existing behavior (with Prepare) for backwards compatibility."

This will allow sign operations on these paths to function correctly, having the correctly inferred default signature bit length. Additionally, this allows the computed default value for key type to be used for minimum size validation in the RSA/ECDSA paths. We additionally enforce the 2048-minimum in this case as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix defaults and validation of ""any"" KeyType  When certutil is given the placeholder any keytype, it attempts to validate and update the default zero value. However, in lacking a default value for SignatureBits, it cannot update the value from the zero value, thus causing validation to fail. Add more awareness to the placeholder ""any"" value to certutil. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add role-based regression tests for key bits  This adds regression tests for Key Type, Key Bits, and Signature Bits parameters on the role.

As noted in the original request, NIST and Mozilla (and others) are fairly prescriptive in the choice of signatures (matching the size of the NIST P-curve), and we shouldn't usually use a smaller (or worse, larger and truncate!) hash. Ignore the configuration of signature bits and always use autodetection for ECDSA like ed25519.

As noted in the original request, NIST and Mozilla (and others) are fairly prescriptive in the choice of signatures (matching the size of the NIST P-curve), and we shouldn't usually use a smaller (or worse, larger and truncate!) hash.

2275,Fix handling of default zero SignatureBits value with Any key type in PKI Secrets Engine (#14875)," Correctly handle minimums, default SignatureBits  When using KeyType = ""any"" on a role (whether explicitly or implicitly via a sign-verbatim like operation), we need to update the value of SignatureBits from its new value 0 to a per-key-type default value. This will allow sign operations on these paths to function correctly, having the correctly inferred default signature bit length. Additionally, this allows the computed default value for key type to be used for minimum size validation in the RSA/ECDSA paths. We additionally enforce the 2048-minimum in this case as well. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Fix defaults and validation of ""any"" KeyType  When certutil is given the placeholder any keytype, it attempts to validate and update the default zero value. However, in lacking a default value for SignatureBits, it cannot update the value from the zero value, thus causing validation to fail. Add more awareness to the placeholder ""any"" value to certutil. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add role-based regression tests for key bits  This adds regression tests for Key Type, Key Bits, and Signature Bits parameters on the role.

2483,Add role parameter to restrict issuance of wildcard certificates (#14238)," Add new AllowWildcardCertificate field to PKI role  This field allows the PKI role to control whether or not issuance of wildcard certificates are allowed. We default (both on migration and new role creation) to the less secure true value for backwards compatibility with existing Vault versions. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Refactor sanitizedName to reducedName  Per comment, this variable name was confusing during the reproduction and subsequent fix of the earlier vulnerability and associated bug report. Because the common name isn't necessarily sanitized in any way (and indeed must be considered in relation to other parts or the whole), but portions of the entire name are removed, reducedName appears to make the most sense. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Enforce AllowWildcardCertificates during issuance  This commit adds the bulk of correctly validating wildcard certificate Common Names during issuance according to RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 semantics. As part of this, support for RFC 2818-conforming wildcard certificates (wherein there are almost no restrictions on issuance) has been removed. Note that this flag does take precedence over AllowAnyName, giving a little more safety in wildcard issuance in this case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Update test cases to conform with RFC 6125  Test cases 19, 70+71, and 83+84 didn't conform with the RFC 6125, and so should've been rejected under strict conformance. For 70+71 and 83+84, we previously conditioned around the value of AllowSubdomains (allowing issuance when true), but they likely should've been rejected either way. Additionally, update the notes about globs matching wildcard certificates to notate this is indeed the case. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Check AllowWildcardCertifciates in issuance tests  This allows for regression tests to cover the new AllowWildcardCertificate conditional. We add additional test cases ensuring that wildcard issuance is properly forbidden in all relevant scenarios, while allowing the existing test cases to validate that wildcard status doesn't affect non-wildcard certificates. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add Wildcard allowance during signing operations  When using sign-verbatim, sign-intermediate, or getting certificate generation parameters, set AllowWildcardCertificates to mirror existing policies.

2488,Fix broken interactions between glob_domains and wildcards (#14235)," Allow issuance of wildcard via glob match  From Vault v1.8.0 onwards, we would incorrectly disallow issuance of a wildcard certificate when allow_glob_domain was enabled with a multi-part glob domain in allowed_domains (such as ..foo) when attempting to issue a wildcard for a subdomain (such as *.bar.foo). This fixes that by reverting an errant change in the case insensitivity patch. Here, when validating against a very powerful glob construct, we leave the wildcard prefix (*.) from the raw common_name element, to allow multi-part globs to match wildcard entries. It is important to note that ""sanitizedName"" is an incorrect variable naming here. Wildcard parsing (per RFC 6125 which supercedes RFC 2818) must be in the left-most segment of the domain, but we lack validation to ensure no internal wildcards exist. Additionally per item 3 of section 6.4.3 of RFC 6125, wildcards MAY be internal to a domain segment, in which case sanitizedName again leaves the wildcard in place. Resolves: #13530 Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Remove duplicate email address check  As pointed out by Steven Clark (author of the removed conditional in 70012cd865b3dcdab376dba0c0e0abc88c48f508), this is duplicate from the now-reintroduced comparison against name (versus the erroneous sanitizedName at the time of his commit). This is a reversion of the changes to builtin/logical/pki/cert_util.go, but keeping the additional valuable test cases.

Instead, we need to place it into the OpenSSH RFC 8709 format. As mentioned in this dependency's README, support in golang.org/x/crypto/ssh is presently lacking for this. When the associated CL is merged, we should be able to remove this dep and rely on the (extended) standard library, however, no review progress appears to have been made since the CL was opened by the author.

2621,Use application/pem-certificate-chain for PEMs (#13927)," Use application/pem-certificate-chain for PEMs  As mentioned in #10948, it appears we're incorrectly using the application/pkix-cert media type for PEM blobs, when application/x-pem-file is more appropriate. Per RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.13, application/pkix-crl is only appropriate when the CRL is in DER form. Likewise, Section 4.2.2.1 states that application/pkix-cert is only applicable when a single DER certificate is used. Per recommendation in RFC 8555 (""ACME""), Section 7.4.2 and 9.1, we use the newer application/pem-certificate-chain media type for certificates. However, this is not applicable for CRLs, so we use fall back to application/x-pem-file for these. Notably, no official IETF source is present for the latter. On the OpenSSL PKI tutorial (https://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mime.html), this type is cited as coming from S/MIME's predecessor, PEM, but neither of the main PEM RFCs (RFC 934, 1421, 1422, 1423, or 1424) mention this type.

2626,Add full CA Chain to /pki/cert/ca_chain response (#13935)," Include full chain in /cert/ca_chain response  This allows callers to get the full chain (including issuing certificates) from a call to /cert/ca_chain. Previously, most endpoints (including during issuance) do not include the root authority, requiring an explicit call to /cert/ca to fetch. This allows full chains to be constructed without without needing multiple calls to the API. Resolves: #13489 Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Add test case for full CA issuance  We test three main scenarios:  A root-only CA's /cert/ca_chain's .data.ca_chain field should     contain only the root, An intermediate CA (with root provide) should contain both the root     and the intermediate. An external (e.g., /config/ca-provided) CA with both root and     intermediate should contain both certs.

3071,Fix PKI Weak Cryptographic Key Lenghths Warning (#12886)," Modernize SSH key lengths  No default change was made in this commit; note that the code already enforced a default of 2048 bits. ssh-keygen and Go's RSA key generation allows for key sizes including 3072, 4096, 8192; update the values of SSH key generation to match PKI's allowed RSA key sizes (from certutil.ValidateKeyTypeLength(...)). We still allow the legacy SSH key size of 1024; in the near future we should likely remove it. Signed-off-by: Alexander Scheel alex.scheel@hashicorp.com  Ensure minimum of 2048-bit PKI RSA keys  While the stated path is a false-positive, verifying all paths is non-trivial. We largely validate API call lengths using certutil.ValidateKeyTypeLength(...), but ensuring no other path calls certutil.generatePrivateKey(...) --- directly or indirectly --- is non-trivial. Thus enforcing a minimum in this method sounds like a sane compromise.

The previous handling allowed    a client to override and specify any extension they requested.  We now require a role to explicitly set this behaviour by setting the parameter    to a '*' value which matches the behaviour of other keys such as allowed_users    within the role. No migration of existing roles is provided either, so operators if they truly    want this behaviour will need to update existing roles appropriately."

3724,Only fail auth plugin backend mounting for custom plugins (#11690),Checking if a plugin is a builtin by comparing it's type to those in the builtin registry allows for a custom plugin loaded with the same name to be considered a builtin during error handling of the mounting process.  This can cause the vault installation to brick itself because it cannot be unsealed to register a new sha256 or file path for a previously loaded custom plugin.  Improve this logic by checking the plugin catalog rather than the builtin registry. Fixes #11687

Configured retries are used for both templating and api proxy, though if template requests go through proxy (currently requires persistence enabled) we'll only configure retries for the latter to avoid duplicate retrying.  Though there is some duplicate retrying already because whenever the template server does a retry when not going through the proxy, the Vault client it uses allows for 2 behind-the-scenes retries for some 400/500 http error codes."

4031,Update init.mdx (#11044)," Update init.mdx  Updated operator init documentation to try to avoid steering customers towards running Auto Unseal seals with recovery-shares=1 and recovery-threshold=1. This is a bad security posture, as it can allow a single user with access to that recovery share to create root tokens and do other very sensitive tasks. Also rewrote parts of the HSM/KMS Options section to indicate that recovery-related options are not solely for HSM-mode Vault but are for ANY Auto Unseal seal.  Update website/content/docs/commands/operator/init.mdx  Adding an appropriate number of recovery-pgp-keys Co-authored-by: Yoko yoko@hashicorp.com Co-authored-by: Yoko yoko@hashicorp.com"

4054,Replace deprecated terms in AWS Auth (#10997)," Replace deprecated terms in AWS Auth  This PR is part of an effort to remove non-inclusive language throughout Vault. The AWS Auth backend uses the ""whitelist"" and ""blacklist"" term extensively, and these are the focus of the PR:  Add new API endpoints that use the preferred terminology, while   deprecating the old endpoints. These endpoints offer identical   functionality and are basically aliases. This is the only functional   change in the PR except for terms in error messages. Replace ""whitelist"" -> ""access list"", ""blacklist"" -> ""deny list"" in   variable names, comments, etc.  Note that storage locations were not changed at this time, as that is a more complex process involving versioning that we may tackle in a future revision. We have reduced the occurrences of non-inclusive language, however. Reviewers should be sure to ""Ignore Whitespace"" in diffs, especially for the tests, which were basically indented one level as part of looping over the tests with both the old and new names."

4277,fix deadlock on core state lock (#10456)," fix race that can cause deadlock on core state lock  The bug is in the grabLockOrStop function. For specific concurrent executions the grabLockOrStop function can return stopped=true when the lock is still held. A comment in grabLockOrStop indicates that the function is only used when the stateLock is held, but grabLockOrStop is being used to acquire the stateLock. If there are concurrent goroutines using grabLockOrStop then some concurrent executions result in stopped=true being returned when the lock is acquired. The fix is to add a lock and some state around which the parent and child goroutine in the grabLockOrStop function can coordinate so that the different concurrent executions can be handled. This change includes a non-deterministic unit test which reliably reproduces the problem before the fix.  use rand instead of time for random test stopCh close  Using time.Now().UnixNano()%2 ends up being system dependent because different operating systems and hardware have different clock resolution. A lower resolution will return the same unix time for a longer period of time. It is better to avoid this issue by using a random number generator. This change uses the rand package default random number generator. It's generally good to avoid using the default random number generator, because it creates extra lock contention. For a test it should be fine."

4927,Remove two unreliable tests from TestTransit_SignVerify_P256.   (#7499),"  Remove two tests from TestTransit_SignVerify_P256.  These verify that you can't verify something signed using JWS marshaling when claiming it's ASN1, and vice versa.  The problem is that we rely on unmarshaling failing, and it doesn't always.  Both encodings use base64, one with padding, one without, so depending on the data sometimes unmarshaling will work when we expect it to fail.  It would be nice to preserve these tests if they could be made reliable, but I didn't see an easy way, and I don't think they add enough value to warrant greater effort.   Restore the tests I removed, and improve the verify function to broaden the notion of errExpected.   Co-authored-by: Vishal Nayak vishalnayak@users.noreply.github.com"

5616,Add a specific reference to AWS IAM Unique Identifiers (#8209), Add specification about AWS IAM Unique Identifiers  We experienced an issue where IAM roles resources were re-provisioned with the same ARNs and no change had been made to our vault role configuration but users lost access with -method=aws. It wasn't immediately clear to us how IAM Unique Identifiers where being used to avoid the same situations outlined in the AWS documentation. We eventually concluded that re-provisioning the roles in our auth/aws/auth would fetch the new IAM Unique Identifiers.  I hope that this small amendment helps people avoid this problem in the future.

If not explicitly set, have the set of cipher suites for the cluster port come from a hand-picked list; either the allowed TLS 1.3 set (for forwards compatibility) or the three identical ones for TLS 1.2. The 1.2 suites have been supported in Go until at least as far back as Go 1.9 from two years ago.

6057,Shamir seals now come in two varieties: legacy and new-style.  (#7694),"Shamir seals now come in two varieties: legacy and new-style. Legacy Shamir is automatically converted to new-style when a rekey operation is performed. All new Vault initializations using Shamir are new-style. New-style Shamir writes an encrypted master key to storage, just like AutoUnseal. The stored master key is encrypted using the shared key that is split via Shamir's algorithm. Thus when unsealing, we take the key fragments given, combine them into a Key-Encryption-Key, and use that to decrypt the master key on disk. Then the master key is used to read the keyring that decrypts the barrier."

6108,Add ability to skip 'LIST ALL' check (#7614),"Currently whenever we start a new C session in the database plugin, we run LIST ALL to determine whether we are a superuser, or otherwise have permissions on roles. This is a fairly sensible way of checking this, except it can be really slow when you have a lot of roles (C isn't so good at listing things). It's also really intensive to C* and leads to a lot of data transfer. We've seen timeout issues when doing this query, and can of course raise the timeout, but we'd probably prefer to be able to switch it off."

This note may help customers to understand sooner that not all highly available backends support transactional updates.

6305,secret/aws: Pass policy ARNs to AssumedRole and FederationToken roles (#6789)," secret/aws: Pass policy ARNs to AssumedRole and FederationToken roles  AWS now allows you to pass policy ARNs as well as, and in addition to, policy documents for AssumeRole and GetFederationToken (see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/05/session-permissions/). Vault already collects policy ARNs for iam_user credential types; now it will allow policy ARNs for assumed_role and federation_token credential types and plumb them through to the appropriate AWS calls. This brings along a minor breaking change. Vault roles of the federation_token credential type are now required to have either a policy_document or a policy_arns specified. This was implicit previously; a missing policy_document would result in a validation error from the AWS SDK when retrieving credentials. However, it would still allow creating a role that didn't have a policy_document specified and then later specifying it, after which retrieving the AWS credentials would work. Similar workflows in which the Vault role didn't have a policy_document specified for some period of time, such as deleting the policy_document and then later adding it back, would also have worked previously but will now be broken. The reason for this breaking change is because a credential_type of federation_token without either a policy_document or policy_arns specified will return credentials that have equivalent permissions to the credentials the Vault server itself is using. This is quite dangerous (e.g., it could allow Vault clients access to retrieve credentials that could modify Vault's underlying storage) and so should be discouraged. This scenario is still possible when passing in an appropriate policy_document or policy_arns parameter, but clients should be explicitly aware of what they are doing and opt in to it by passing in the appropriate role parameters.  Error out on dangerous federation token retrieval  The AWS secrets role code now disallows creation of a dangerous role configuration; however, pre-existing roles could have existed that would trigger this now-dangerous code path, so also adding a check for this configuration at credential retrieval time.

6312,Store less data in Cassandra prefix buckets (#7199)," Store less data in Cassandra prefix buckets  The Cassandra physical backend relies on storing data for sys/foo/bar under sys, sys/foo, and sys/foo/bar. This is necessary so that we can list the sys bucket, get a list of all child keys, and then trim this down to find child 'folders' eg food. Right now however, we store the full value of every storage entry in all three buckets. This is unnecessary as the value will only ever be read out in the leaf bucket ie sys/foo/bar. We use the intermediary buckets simply for listing keys. We have seen some issues around compaction where certain buckets, particularly intermediary buckets that are exclusively for listing, get really clogged up with data to the point of not being listable. Buckets like sys/expire/id are huge, combining lease expiry data for all auth methods, and need to be listed for vault to successfully become leader. This PR tries to cut down on the amount of data stored in intermediary buckets.  Avoid goroutine leak by buffering results channel up to the bucket count"

First, some code that previously lived in enterprise has moved here: this includes some helper code for manipulating clusters and for building storage backends.  Second, the existing cluster-building code using inmem storage has been generalized to allow various storage backends. Third, added support for creating two-cluster DR setups. Finally, there are tweaks to handle edge cases that result in intermittent failures, or to eliminate sleeps in favour of polling to detect state changes. Also: generalize TestClusterOptions.PhysicalFactory so it can be used either as a per-core factory (for raft) or a per-cluster factory (for other storage backends.)"

6532,Fix various read only storage errors," Fix various read only storage errors  A mistake we've seen multiple times in our own plugins and that we've seen in the GCP plugin now is that control flow (how the code is structured, helper functions, etc.) can obfuscate whether an error came from storage or some other Vault-core location (in which case likely it needs to be a 5XX message) or because of user input (thus 4XX). Error handling for functions therefore often ends up always treating errors as either user related or internal. When the error is logical.ErrReadOnly this means that treating errors as user errors skips the check that triggers forwarding, instead returning a read only view error to the user. While it's obviously more correct to fix that code, it's not always immediately apparent to reviewers or fixers what the issue is and fixing it when it's found both requires someone to hit the problem and report it (thus exposing bugs to users) and selective targeted refactoring that only helps that one specific case. If instead we check whether the logical.Response is an error and, if so, whether it contains the error value, we work around this in all of these cases automatically. It feels hacky since it's a coding mistake, but it's one we've made too multiple times, and avoiding bugs altogether is better for our users."

6733,Fix a deadlock if a panic happens during request handling (#6920)," Fix a deadlock if a panic happens during request handling  During request handling, if a panic is created, deferred functions are run but otherwise execution stops. #5889 changed some locks to non-defers but had the side effect of causing the read lock to not be released if the request panicked. This fixes that and addresses a few other potential places where things could go wrong: 1) In sealInitCommon we always now defer a function that unlocks the read lock if it hasn't been unlocked already 2) In StepDown we defer the RUnlock but we also had two error cases that were calling it manually. These are unlikely to be hit but if they were I believe would cause a panic.  Add panic recovery test"

6809,Fix a case where mounts could be duplicated (#6771),"When unmounting, the router entry would be tainted, preventing routing. However, we would then unmount the router before clearing storage, so if an error occurred the router would have forgotten the path. For auth mounts this isn't a problem since they had a secondary check, but regular mounts didn't (not sure why, but this is true back to at least 0.2.0). This meant you could then create a duplicate mount using the same path which would then not conflict in the router until postUnseal. This adds the extra check to regular mounts, and also moves the location of the router unmount. This also ensures that on the next router.Mount, tainted is set to the mount entry's tainted status.

Vendor go-cmp.   Fix incomplete vendoring of go-cmp.   Improve test coverage.  Fix bug whereby access to a subtree named X would expose existence of a the key named X at the same level.   Add benchmarks, which showed that hasNonDenyCapability would be ""expensive"" to call for every member of a large folder.  Made a couple of minor tweaks so that now it can be done without allocations.   Comment cleanup.   Review requested changes: rename some funcs, use routeCommon instead of querying storage directly.   Keep the same endpoint for now, but move it from a LIST to a POST and allow multiple paths to be queried in one operation.   Modify test to pass multiple paths in at once.   Add endpoint to default policy.   Move endpoint to /sys/access/filtered-path. "

7545,Continuously attempt to unseal if sealed keys are supported (#6039)," Add helper for checking if an error is a fatal error  The double-double negative was really confusing, and this pattern is used a few places in Vault. This negates the double negative, making the devx a bit easier to follow.   Check return value of UnsealWithStoredKeys in sys/init   Return proper error types when attempting unseal with stored key   Prior to this commit, ""nil"" could have meant unsupported auto-unseal, a transient error, or success. This updates the function to return the correct error type, signaling to the caller whether they should retry or fail.  Continuously attempt to unseal if sealed keys are supported  This fixes a bug that occurs on bootstrapping an initial cluster. Given a collection of Vault nodes and an initialized storage backend, they will all go into standby waiting for initialization. After one node is initialized, the other nodes had no mechanism by which they ""re-check"" to see if unseal keys are present. This adds a goroutine to the server command which continually waits for unseal keys to exist. It exits in the following conditions:  the node is unsealed the node does not support stored keys a fatal error occurs (as defined by Vault) the server is shutting down  In all other situations, the routine wakes up at the specified interval and attempts to unseal with the stored keys."

Key lookups are a different API method not covered by roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter. This means users must grant an extended scope to their service account (granting the ability to read key data) which only seems to be used to validate the existence of the key. Worse, the only roles that include this permission are overly verbose (e.g. roles/viewer which gives readonly access to everything in the project and roles/cloudkms.admin which gives full control over all key operations). This leaves the user stuck between choosing to create a custom IAM role (which isn't fun) or grant overly broad permissions. By changing to an encrypt call, we get better verification of the unseal permissions and users can reduce scope to a single role."

7655,Strip empty strings from database revocation stmts (#5955)," Strip empty strings from database revocation stmts  It's technically valid to give empty strings as statements to run on most databases. However, in the case of revocation statements, it's not only generally inadvisable but can lead to lack of revocations when you expect them. This strips empty strings from the array of revocation statements. It also makes two other changes:   Return statements on read as empty but valid arrays rather than nulls, so that typing information is inferred (this is more in line with the rest of Vault these days)   Changes field data for TypeStringSlice and TypeCommaStringSlice such that a client-supplied value of """" doesn't turn into []string{""""} but rather []string{}.   The latter and the explicit revocation statement changes are related, and defense in depth."

7681,Remove DEL characters from password input (#5837)," Remove DEL characters from password input  iTerm password manager sends \x03\0x7f before sending a password from its password manager to make sure the password is not being echoed to the screen.  Unfortunately, vault login does not handle the Space DEL sequence, causing the login to fail when using the password manager.  This patch uses a simple method to delete the sequence if present anywhere in the string, although it is strictly only needed at the start of input.  Simplify iTerm handling to only remove iTerm prefix  The logic now only removes the two byte prefix sent in by iTerm instead of trying to remove all deletes in the string. This has been tested to work with the iTerm password manager. As a small correction, the byte sequence is \x20\x7f.  The earlier commit message incorrectly stated it was \x03\x7f."

Both threads of execution can concurently decide to call c.session.Close() in mongodb/connection_producer.go:119, and then mgo panics when the second close attempt occurs."

8273,logical/aws: Harden WAL entry creation (#5202)," logical/aws: Harden WAL entry creation  If AWS IAM user creation failed in any way, the WAL corresponding to the IAM user would get left around and Vault would try to roll it back. However, because the user never existed, the rollback failed. Thus, the WAL would essentially get ""stuck"" and Vault would continually attempt to roll it back, failing every time. A similar situation could arise if the IAM user that Vault created got deleted out of band, or if Vault deleted it but was unable to write the lease revocation back to storage (e.g., a storage failure). This attempts to harden it in two ways. One is by deleting the WAL log entry if the IAM user creation fails. However, the WAL deletion could still fail, and this wouldn't help where the user is deleted out of band, so second, consider the user rolled back if the user just doesn't exist, under certain circumstances. Fixes #5190  Fix segfault in expiration unit tests  TestExpiration_Tidy was passing in a leaseEntry that had a nil Secret, which then caused a segfault as the changes to revokeEntry didn't check whether Secret was nil; this is probably unlikely to occur in real life, but good to be extra cautious.

Rather than just use RoleSessionName as the Identity alias, the full ARN is uses as the Alias. This mitigates against concerns that an AWS role with an insufficiently secured trust policy could allow an attacker to generate arbitrary RoleSessionNames in AssumeRole calls to impersonate anybody in the Identity store that had an alias set up. By using the full ARN, the owner of the identity store has to explicitly trust specific AWS roles in specific AWS accounts to generate an appropriate RoleSessionName to map back to an identity.

Parameterize IAM user name  Probably not needed, but future-proofing the code  Make remainder of tests parallel  AWS_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable is no longer being used; global mutable state is a recipe for disaster when trying to run things in parallel, and parallelizing the tests exposed a race condition in which they were depending on the AWS_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable to be set before they were run.

8583,Make AWS credential types more explicit (#4360)," Make AWS credential types more explicit  The AWS secret engine had a lot of confusing overloading with role paramemters and how they mapped to each of the three credential types supported. This now adds parameters to remove the overloading while maintaining backwards compatibility. With the change, it also becomes easier to add other feature requests. Attaching multiple managed policies to IAM users and adding a policy document to STS AssumedRole credentials is now also supported. Fixes #4229 Fixes #3751 Fixes #2817   Add missing write action to STS endpoint   Allow unsetting policy_document with empty string   This allows unsetting the policy_document by passing in an empty string. Previously, it would fail because the empty string isn't a valid JSON document.   Respond to some PR feedback   Refactor and simplify role reading/upgrading   This gets rid of the duplicated role upgrade code between both role reading and role writing by handling the upgrade all in the role reading.

8744,Two small items: (#4934),"1) Disable MaxRetries in test cluster clients. We generally want to fail as fast as possible in tests so adding unpredictable timing in doesn't help things, especially if we're timing sensitive in the test. 2) EquivalentPolicies is supposed to return true if only one set contains default and the other is empty, but if one set was nil instead of simply a zero length slice it would always return false. This means that renewing against, say, userpass when not actually specifying any user policies would always fail."

This could mean a sort of hard stop if Vault gets sealed because the function won't have the read lock. This should generally be okay (running tidy again should pick back up where it left off), but future work could use cleanup funcs to trigger the functions to stop.

8906,Allow vault ssh to accept ssh commands in any ssh compatible format (#4710), Allow vault ssh to accept ssh commands in any ssh compatible format  Previously vault ssh required ssh commands to be in the format username@hostname <flags> command. While this works just fine for human users this breaks a lot of automation workflows and is not compatible with the options that the ssh client supports. Motivation We currently run ansible which uses vault ssh to connect to hosts. Ansible generates ssh commands with the format ssh <flags> -o User=username hostname command. While this is a valid ssh command it currently breaks with vault because vault expects the format to be username@hostname. To work around this we currently use a wrapper script to parse the correct username being set by ansible and translate this into a vault ssh compatible username@hostname format Changes  You can now specify arguments in any order that ssh client allows. All arguments are passed directly to the ssh command and the format isn't modified in any way. The username and port are parsed from the specified ssh command. It will accept all of the options supported by the ssh command and also will properly prefer -p and user@ if both options are specified. The ssh port is only added from the vault credentials if it hasn't been specified on the command line

8909,Changes the way policies are reported in audit logs (#4747)," This changes the way policies are reported in audit logs.  Previously, only policies tied to tokens would be reported. This could make it difficult to perform after-the-fact analysis based on both the initial response entry and further requests. Now, the full set of applicable policies from both the token and any derived policies from Identity are reported. To keep things consistent, token authentications now also return the full set of policies in api.Secret.Auth responses, so this both makes it easier for users to understand their actual full set, and it matches what the audit logs now report."
8910,Remove a lot of deferred functions in the request path. (#4733)," Remove a lot of deferred functions in the request path.  There is an interesting benchmark at https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3h21nk/simple_micro_benchmark_to_measure_the_overhead_of/ It shows that defer actually adds quite a lot of overhead -- maybe 100ns per call but we defer a lot of functions in the request path. So this removes some of the ones in request handling, ha, barrier, router, and physical cache. One meta-note: nearly every metrics function is in a defer which means every metrics call we add could add a non-trivial amount of time, e.g. for every 10 extra metrics statements we add 1ms to a request. I don't know how to solve this right now without doing what I did in some of these cases and putting that call into a simple function call that then goes before each return.

This tries to detect that scenario and perform best-effort cleanup. We only do this on zero length files to ensure that if an encode fails to write but the system hasn't already performed truncation, we leave the existing data alone. Vault should never write a zero-byte file (as opposed to a zero-byte value in the encoded JSON) so if this case is hit it's always an error.  Also run a check on Get"

9201,Fix response wrapping from K/V version 2 (#4511),"This takes place in two parts, since working on this exposed an issue with response wrapping when there is a raw body set. The changes are (in diff order):   A CurrentWrappingLookupFunc has been added to return the current value. This is necessary for the lookahead call since we don't want the lookahead call to be wrapped.   Support for unwrapping < 0.6.2 tokens via the API/CLI has been removed, because we now have backends returning 404s with data and can't rely on the 404 trick. These can still be read manually via cubbyhole/response.   KV preflight version request now ensures that its calls is not wrapped, and restores any given function after.   When responding with a raw body, instead of always base64-decoding a string value and erroring on failure, on failure we assume that it simply wasn't a base64-encoded value and use it as is.   A test that fails on master and works now that ensures that raw body responses that are wrapped and then unwrapped return the expected values.   A flag for response data that indicates to the wrapping handling that the data contained therein is already JSON decoded (more later).   RespondWithStatusCode now defaults to a string so that the value is HMAC'd during audit. The function always JSON encodes the body, so before now it was always returning []byte which would skip HMACing. We don't know what's in the data, so this is a ""better safe than sorry"" issue. If different behavior is needed, backends can always manually populate the data instead of relying on the helper function.   We now check unwrapped data after unwrapping to see if there were raw flags. If so, we try to detect whether the value can be unbase64'd. The reason is that if it can it was probably originally a []byte and shouldn't be audit HMAC'd; if not, it was probably originally a string and should be. In either case, we then set the value as the raw body and hit the flag indicating that it's already been JSON decoded so not to try again before auditing. Doing it this way ensures the right typing.   There is now a check to see if the data coming from unwrapping is already JSON decoded and if so the decoding is skipped before setting the audit response. "

I'm not sure how to test this specifically; I've done some testing of e.g. sealing vault and unsealing and ensuring that I can write to a KV mount. I think this is tested by every dev server though, since for a dev server Vault is inited, the default mounts are mounted, then it's sealed, then it's unsealed for the user, so it already goes through this code path. The mere fact that you can write to secret/ on a dev server means it was successfully set read-write. "

9695,Accept temp creds in AWS secret backend acceptance tests (#4076)," Accept temp creds in AWS secret backend acceptance tests  The AWS secret backend acceptance tests implicitly accepted long-lived AWS credentials (i.e., AWS IAM user and/or root credentials) in two ways:  It expected credentials to be passed in via the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables. By not accepting    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN or AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN, temporary credentials could    not be passed in. (This also forced all credentials to be passed in    via environment variables, which is a bit ugly). The AWS sts:GetFederationToken call is only allowed from long-term    credentials. This is called by the Vault code which the acceptance    tests exercise.  1 is solved by deleting explicit references to credentials, which allows the SDK to do one of the things it does best -- find credentials via the default chain. 2 is a little more complicated. Rather than pass in whatever creds the acceptance test was run under to the backend, the acceptance test now creates a new IAM user and gets an access key from it, then passes the IAM user's creds back to the backend so that it can call sts:GetFederationToken (and then tries to clean up afterwards).  Fix Travis build failure  The Travis build was failing because the user creation was happening regardless of whether it was running in acceptance test mode or not. This moves the user creation into the acceptance test precheck, which requires lazily evaluating the credentials when configuring the backend in the STS accetpance test, and so moving that to a PreFlight closure.  Reduce blind sleeps in AWS secret backend acceptance tests  This removes a blind ""sleep 10 seconds and then attempt to reuse the credential"" codepath and instead just keeps attemtping to reuse the credential for 10 seconds and fails if there aren't any successful uses after 10 seconds. This adds a few seconds speedup of acceptance test runs from my experiments."

This PR extracts the functions associated with loading and parsing configs, and the DefaultTokenHelper, into a command/config subpackage, just like TokenHelpers are in the command/token subpackage. The goal is to allow other clients (in this case, the Vault and Nomad Terraform providers, but in theory any client that wants to lean on Vault's default behaviour) to reuse this logic and not drift from Vault, without vendoring the entirety of Vault. To retain backwards compatibility, I didn't remove any functions from the command package; I just copied them into the command/config package, and update the functions in the command package to call through to the config package."

This option is particularly commpelling because if set to a blank string, Consul will leverage the node configuration where the service is registered which includes the translate_wan_addrs option. This option conditionally associates nodes' lan or wan address based on where requests originate.  Add TestConsul_ServiceAddress  Ensures that the service_address configuration parameter is setting the serviceAddress field of ConsulBackend instances properly. If the ""service_address"" parameter is not set, the ConsulBackend serviceAddress field must instantiate as nil to indicate that it can be ignored."

Along the way I discovered that currently, the x/net/http2 package is broke with the built-in h2 support in released Go. For those using DefaultConfig (the vast majority of cases) this will be a non-event. Others can manually call http2.ConfigureTransport as needed. We should keep an eye on commits on that repo and consider more updates before release. Alternately we could go back revisions but miss out on bug fixes; my theory is that this is not a purposeful break and I'll be following up on this in the Go issue tracker. In a few tests that don't use NewTestCluster, either for legacy or other reasons, ensure that http2.ConfigureTransport is called.   Use tls config cloning   Don't http2.ConfigureServer anymore as current Go seems to work properly without requiring the http2 package   Address feedback "

Now, just unilaterally lowercase policy names on write and delete. On get, to avoid the performance hit of always lowercasing when not necessary since it's in the critical path, we have a minor optimization -- we check the LRU first before normalizing. For tokens, because they're already normalized when adding policies during creation, this should always work; it might just be slower for API calls. Fixes #3187"

10840,Add host key checking for SSH CA,
10841,"Revoke temporary cred after creation, update warning",/cc @vishalnayak
10842,Initial pass at SSH CLI CA type authentication,"  The current implementation of the SSH command is heavily tied to the assumptions of OTP/dynamic key types. The SSH CA backend is fundamentally a different approach to login and authentication. As a result, there was some restructuring of existing methods to share more code and state.   Each authentication method (ca, otp, dynamic) are now fully-contained in their own handle* function.   -mode and -role are going to be required for SSH CA, and I don't think the magical UX (and overhead) of guessing them is a good UX. It's confusing as to which role and how Vault guesses. We can reduce 66% of the API calls and add more declaration to the CLI by making -mode and -role required. This commit adds warnings for that deprecation, but these values are both required for CA type authentication.   The principal and extensions are currently fixed, and I personally believe that's good enough for the first pass at this. Until we understand what configuration options users will want, I think we should ship with all the local extensions enabled. Users who don't want that can generate the key themselves directly (current behavior) or submit PRs to make the map of extensions customizable.   Host key checking for the CA backend is not currently implemented. It's not strictly required at setup, so I need to think about whether it belongs here.   This is not ready for merge, but it's ready for early review."

All system users can see the password in the command line with a simple ""ps"" command. Sshpass makes a minimal attempt to hide the password, but such attempts are doomed to create race conditions without actually solving the problem. Users of sshpass are encouraged to use one of the other password passing techniques, which are all more secure.  This PR changes the sshpass behavior to execute a subprocess with the SSHPASS envvar (which is generally regarded as more secure) than using the -p option."

11240,Check if there's a bound iam arn when renewing (#2819),"Previously, the renew method would ALWAYS check to ensure the authenticated IAM principal ARN matched the bound ARN.  However, there is a valid use case in which no bound_iam_principal_arn is specified and all bindings are done through inferencing. When a role is configured like this, clients won't be able to renew their token because of the check. This now checks to ensure that the bound_iam_principal_arn is not empty before requriing that it match the originally authenticated client. Fixes #2781"

11276,Add max_parallel parameter to MySQL backend. (#2760)," Add max_parallel parameter to MySQL backend.  This limits the number of concurrent connections, so that vault does not die suddenly from ""Too many connections"". This can happen when e.g. vault starts up, and tries to load all the existing leases in parallel. At the time of writing this, the value ExpirationRestoreWorkerCount in vault/helper/consts/const.go is set to 64, meaning that if there are enough leases in the vault's DB, it will generate AT LEAST 64 concurrent connections to MySQL when loading the data during start-up. On certain configurations, e.g. smaller AWS RDS/Aurora instances, this will cause Vault to fail startup.  Fix a typo in mysql storage readme"

This is a small rename commit to keep the commit history clean.  Expand aws-ec2 backend to more generic aws  This adds the ability to authenticate arbitrary AWS IAM principals using AWS's sts:GetCallerIdentity method. The AWS-EC2 auth backend is being to just AWS with the expansion.  Add missing aws auth handler to CLI  This was omitted from the previous commit  aws auth backend general variable name cleanup  Also fixed a bug where allowed auth types weren't being checked upon login, and added tests for it.   Update docs for the aws auth backend   Refactor aws bind validation   Fix env var override in aws backend test   Intent is to override the AWS environment variables with the TEST_* versions if they are set, but the reverse was happening.  Update docs on use of IAM authentication profile  AWS now allows you to change the instance profile of a running instance, so the use case of ""a long-lived instance that's not in an instance profile"" no longer means you have to use the the EC2 auth method.

12499,Fix zookeeper backend so that properly deletes/lists secrets.,"This patch fixes two bugs in Zookeeper backends:  * backend was determining if the node is a leaf or not basing on the number    of the childer given node has. This is incorrect if you consider the fact    that deleteing nested node can leave empty prefixes/dirs behind which have    neither children nor data inside. The fix changes this situation by testing    if the node has any data set - if not then it is not a leaf.  * zookeeper does not delete nodes that do not have childern just like consul    does and this leads to leaving empty nodes behind. In order to fix it, we    scan the logical path of a secret being deleted for empty dirs/prefixes and    remove them up until first non-empty one."

13052,LDAP Auth Backend Overhaul," Added new configuration option to ldap auth backend - groupfilter. GroupFilter accepts a Go template which will be used in conjunction with GroupDN for finding the groups a user is a member of. The template will be provided with context consisting of UserDN and Username. Simplified group membership lookup significantly to support multiple use-cases:   * Enumerating groups via memberOf attribute on user object   * Previous default behavior of querying groups based on member/memberUid/uniqueMember attributes   * Custom queries to support nested groups in AD via LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN matchind rule There is now a new configuration option - groupattr - which specifies how to resolve group membership from the objects returned by the primary groupfilter query. Additional changes:   * Clarify documentation for LDAP auth backend.   * Reworked how default values are set, added tests   * Removed Dial from LDAP config read. Network should not affect configuration."

13524,Remove prepared stmnts from pgsql physical backend,Prepared statements prevent the use of connection multiplexing software such as PGBouncer. Even when PGBouncer is configured for session mode there's a possibility that a connection to PostgreSQL can be re-used by different clients.  This leads to errors when clients use session based features (like prepared statements). This change removes prepared statements from the PostgreSQL physical backend. This will allow vault to successfully work in infrastructures that employ the use of PGBouncer or other connection multiplexing software.

13887,Clarify delete operation,"One thing that has been a point of confusion for users is Vault's response when deleting a key that does not actually exist in the system. For example, consider: $ vault delete secret/foo Success! Deleted 'secret/foo'  This message is misleading if the secret does not exist, especially if the same command is run twice in a row. Obviously the reason for this is clear - returning an error if a secret does not exist would reveal the existence of a secret (the same reason everything on S3 is a 403 or why GitHub repos 404 instead of 403 if you do not have permission to view them). I think we can make the UX a little bit better by adding just a few words to the output: $ vault delete secret/foo Success! Deleted 'secret/foo' if it existed  This makes it clear that the operation was only performed if the secret existed, but it does not reveal any more information."

A number of users then run: $ vault auth defg-5678  I've added some helpful text to hint this is not required if the method is not ""token""."

13993,changelog++,
13994,Keep the expiration manager from keeping old token entries.,"The expiration manager would never be poked to remove token entries upon token revocation, if that revocation was initiated in the token store itself. It might have been to avoid deadlock, since during revocation of tokens the expiration manager is called, which then calls back into the token store, and so on. This adds a way to skip that last call back into the token store if we know that we're on the revocation path because we're in the middle of revoking a token. That way the lease is cleaned up. This both prevents log entries appearing for already-revoked tokens, and it also releases timer/memory resources since we're not keeping the leases around."

This can not only cause Vault to cycle trying to revoke them, but it also prevents mounts from being unmounted, leaving them in a tainted state where the only operations allowed are to revoke (or rollback), which will never successfully complete. This adds a new endpoint that works similarly to revoke-prefix but ignores errors coming from a backend upon revocation (it does not ignore errors coming from within the expiration manager, such as errors accessing the data store). This can be used to force Vault to abandon leases. Like revoke-prefix, this is a very sensitive operation and requires sudo. It is implemented as a separate endpoint, rather than an argument to revoke-prefix, to ensure that control can be delegated appropriately, as even most administrators should not normally have this privilege.

In the PKI backend, if the CA is reconfigured but not fully (e.g. an intermediate CSR is generated but no corresponding cert set) and there are already leases (issued certs), the CRL is unable to be built. As a result revocation fails. But in this case we don't actually need revocation to be successful since the CRL is useless after unmounting. By checking taint status we know if we can simply fast-path out of revocation with a success in this case. Fixes #946"

In this configuration, calling Sync (or AutoSync) on the etcd client will replace the load balancer addresses with the underlying etcd server address. This will cause the etcd client to bypass the load balancers, and may cause the connection to fail completely if the etcd servers are protected by a firewall. This patch provides a ""sync"" option for the etcd backend, which defaults to the current behavior, but which can be used to turn off of sync. This corresponds to etcdctl's --no-sync option."

15027,Mostly revert changes to certutil as the embedded struct stuff was being,problematic.
15028,Update validator function for URIs. Change example of entering a CA to a,root cert generation. Other minor documentation updates. Fix private key output in issue/sign.
15029,First draft at a contributing guide. Based off of Terraform's guide,
15030,fix tests,
15031,Make it clear that generating/setting a CA cert will overwrite what's,there.
15032,Split root and intermediate functionality into their own sections in the API. Update documentation. Add sign-verbatim endpoint.,

15042,"Add URLs methods to set OCSP/CRL/CA urls in issued certs, and tests.",
15043,Add tests for using raw CSR values,
15044,Change a few checks on names:,"  Allow an email address to be the common name of a cert even if email protection isn't in the role if any name is set to true (this allows certificates with a common name entry of an email address but used for other purposes; here just for CA cert signing).   Don't check the user part of an email against the hostname regex. Emails can contain e.g. ""+"" and ""_"" and these should be allowed even though they're not part of a valid hostname.   Also, fix a nil pointer issue."
15045,Add config/urls CRUD operations to get and set the URLs encoded into,"certificates for the issuing certificate URL, CRL distribution points, and OCSP servers."

Now settable when generating a self-signed root or setting a CA cert into the backend; if not set, these values are not set in issued certs. Not required when signing an intermediate cert (and in fact it was wrong to do so in the first place)."

In the process of adding the HTTP handler, this also removes the custom HTTP handlers for the other audit endpoints, which were simply forwarding to the logical system backend. This means that the various audit functions will now redirect correctly from a standby to master. (Tests all pass.) Fixes #784"

15075,Address feedback from review,
15076,Rearchitect MountTable locking and fix rollback.,"The rollback manager was using a saved MountTable rather than the current table, causing it to attempt to rollback unmounted mounts, and never rollback new mounts. In fixing this, it became clear that bad things could happen to the mount table...the table itself could be locked, but the table pointer (which is what the rollback manager needs) could be modified at any time without locking. This commit therefore also returns locking to a mutex outside the table instead of inside, and plumbs RLock/RUnlock through to the various places that are reading the table but not holding a write lock. Both unit tests and race detection pass. Fixes #771"

15368,Implement the cubbyhole backend,"In order to implement this efficiently, I have introduced the concept of ""singleton"" backends -- currently, 'sys' and 'cubbyhole'. There isn't much reason to allow sys to be mounted at multiple places, and there isn't much reason you'd need multiple per-token storage areas. By restricting it to just one, I can store that particular mount instead of iterating through them in order to call the appropriate revoke function. Additionally, because revocation on the backend needs to be triggered by the token store, the token store's salt is kept in the router and client tokens going to the cubbyhole backend are double-salted by the router. This allows the token store to drive when revocation happens using its salted tokens."

The reason for the refactor is that while implementing Renew/Revoke in logical/framework I found the existing API to be really awkward to work with. Primarily, we needed a way to send down internal data for Vault core to store since not all the data you need to revoke a key is always sent down to the user (for example the user than AWS key belongs to). At first, I was doing this manually in logical/framework with req.Storage, but this is going to be such a common event that I think its something core should assist with. Additionally, I think the added context for secrets will be useful in the future when we have a Vault API for returning orphaned out keys: we can also return the internal data that might help an operator. So this leads me to this refactor. I've removed most of the fields in logical.Response and replaced it with a single *Secret pointer. If this is non-nil, then the response represents a secret. The Secret struct encapsulates all the lease info and such. It also has some fields on it that are only populated at request time for Revoke/Renew operations. There is precedent for this sort of behavior in the Go stdlib where http.Request/http.Response have fields that differ based on client/server. I copied this style. All core unit tests pass. The APIs fail for obvious reasons but I'll fix that up in the next commit."

17095,vault: make Mount related core functions public,"/cc @armon - So I know the conversation we had related to this about auth, but I think we still need to export these and do auth only at the external API layer. If you're writing to the internal API, then all bets are off. The reason is simply that if you have access to the code, you can already work around it anyways (you can disable auth or w/e), so a compromised Vault source/binary is already a failure, and that is the only thing that our previous unexported methods were protecting against. If you write an external tool to access a Vault, it still needs to be unsealed so that is the primary security mechanism from an API perspective. Once it is unsealed then the core API has full access to the Vault, and identity/auth is only done at the external API layer, not at the internal API layer. The benefits of this approach is that it lets us still treat the ""sys"" mount specially but at least have sys adopt helper/backend and use that machinery and it can still be the only backend which actually has a reference to vault.Core to do core things (a key difference).
