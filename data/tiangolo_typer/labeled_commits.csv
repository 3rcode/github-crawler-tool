PR #356 by @tiangolo."," Support custom parameter types  While most CLI parameters are strings, ints, etc, we sometimes need custom types. Currently typer has no support for it (See #77), and while there are a few hacks, the likely solution is to add a 'str' argument and parse it inside the main function. This PR adds support for custom types in 3 different ways: - Manually specifying a click_type - Manually specifying a parse function - Using a Callable type annotation (It is very common for types to have a string constructor, like int(""1""))  Document how to parse custom objects with Typer.
