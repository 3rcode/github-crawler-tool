Add support for help parameter in CLI arguments:
As help in CLI arguments is not supported by Click, there are two new internal classes (Click sub-classes) to support it:
typer.core.TyperArgument
typer.core.TyperCommand


This includes a new auto-generated help text section Arguments for CLI arguments, showing defaults, required arguments, etc.
It's also possible to disable it and keep the previous behavior, not showing automatic help for CLI arguments (Click's default) using the hidden parameter.
Now show_default is True by default.
And now show_envvar is True by default.
So, default values and env vars are shown in the help text by default, without having to manually enable them, for both CLI arguments and CLI options.
New docs:
CLI Arguments Intro.
Optional CLI Arguments.
CLI Arguments with Default.
CLI Arguments with Help.
CLI Arguments with Environment Variables.
CLI Arguments: Other uses.
CLI arguments with tuples.

Add optional dependency shellingham to auto detect shell to install (it was used by click-completion).
Completion now doesn't require a third party library.
