✨ Add support for custom types and parsers (updates/builds upon PR #443) (#583),0.9559799,✨ Add support for custom types and parsers. Initial PR #583 by @jpurviance. Based on original PR #443 by @paulo-raca.,"Support custom parameter types While most CLI parameters are strings, ints, etc, we sometimes need custom types. Currently typer has no support for it (See #77), and while there are a few hacks, the likely solution is to add a 'str' argument and parse it inside the main function. This PR adds support for custom types in 3 different ways: - Manually specifying a click_type - Manually specifying a parse function - Using a Callable type annotation (It is very common for types to have a string constructor, like int(""1"")) Document how to parse custom objects with Typer. Typer supports parsing of cutom types with: - A user provided parser class - A click custom type parser 🎨 [pre-commit.ci] Auto format from pre-commit.com hooks 📝 Tweak and simplify docs ✅ Tweak tests to run scripts and remove pragma: nocover in examples 📝 Tweak examples for docs, add types and remove # pragma: nocover ♻️ Tweak implementation checking for parser and Click type Co-authored-by: Paulo Costa me@paulo.costa.nom.br Co-authored-by: pre-commit-ci[bot] 66853113+pre-commit-ci[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Co-authored-by: Sebastián Ramírez tiangolo@gmail.com",1
