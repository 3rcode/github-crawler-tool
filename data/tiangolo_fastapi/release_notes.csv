6,"Highlights
This release adds support for dependencies and parameters using Annotated and recommends its usage. ✨
This has several benefits, one of the main ones is that now the parameters of your functions with Annotated would not be affected at all.
If you call those functions in other places in your code, the actual default values will be kept, your editor will help you notice missing required arguments, Python will require you to pass required arguments at runtime, you will be able to use the same functions for different things and with different libraries (e.g. Typer will soon support Annotated too, then you could use the same function for an API and a CLI), etc.
Because Annotated is standard Python, you still get all the benefits from editors and tools, like autocompletion, inline errors, etc.
One of the biggest benefits is that now you can create Annotated dependencies that are then shared by multiple path operation functions, this will allow you to reduce a lot of code duplication in your codebase, while keeping all the support from editors and tools.
For example, you could have code like this:
```Python
def get_current_user(token: str):
    # authenticate user
    return User()
@app.get(""/items/"")
def read_items(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    ...
@app.post(""/items/"")
def create_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item: Item):
    ...
@app.get(""/items/{item_id}"")
def read_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...
@app.delete(""/items/{item_id}"")
def delete_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...
```
There's a bit of code duplication for the dependency:
Python
user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
...the bigger the codebase, the more noticeable it is.
Now you can create an annotated dependency once, like this:
Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
And then you can reuse this Annotated dependency:
```Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
@app.get(""/items/"")
def read_items(user: CurrentUser):
    ...
@app.post(""/items/"")
def create_item(user: CurrentUser, item: Item):
    ...
@app.get(""/items/{item_id}"")
def read_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...
@app.delete(""/items/{item_id}"")
def delete_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...
```
...and CurrentUser has all the typing information as User, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and FastAPI will be able to understand the dependency defined in Annotated. 😎
Roughly all the docs have been rewritten to use Annotated as the main way to declare parameters and dependencies. All the examples in the docs now include a version with Annotated and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀
The key updated docs are:

Python Types Intro:
Type Hints with Metadata Annotations.


Tutorial:
Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation
Advantages of Annotated


Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks
Better with Annotated


Dependencies - First Steps - Share Annotated dependencies

✨ Add support for lifespan async context managers (superseding startup and shutdown events). Initial PR #2944 by @uSpike.

Now, instead of using independent startup and shutdown events, you can define that logic in a single function with yield decorated with @asynccontextmanager (an async context manager).
For example:
```Python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42
ml_models = {}
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Load the ML model
    ml_models[""answer_to_everything""] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield
    # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
    ml_models.clear()
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
@app.get(""/predict"")
async def predict(x: float):
    result = ml_models""answer_to_everything""
    return {""result"": result}
```
Note: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using startup and shutdown events.
Read more about it in the new docs: Advanced User Guide: Lifespan Events.

✨ Add support for lifespan async context managers (superseding startup and shutdown events). Initial PR #2944 by @uSpike.
Now, instead of using independent startup and shutdown events, you can define that logic in a single function with yield decorated with @asynccontextmanager (an async context manager).
For example:
module
Note: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using startup and shutdown events.

⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.25.0. PR #5996 by @tiangolo.
This solves a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks by using many small multipart fields/files (parts), consuming high CPU and memory.
Only applications using forms (e.g. file uploads) could be affected.
For most cases, upgrading won't have any breaking changes.

⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to 0.24.0 and refactor internals for compatibility. PR #5985 by @tiangolo.
This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette 0.24.0, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks @adriangb! Starlette PR #2017). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called).
If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.

✨ Add support for function return type annotations to declare the response_model. Initial PR #1436 by @uriyyo.

Now you can declare the return type / response_model in the function return type annotation:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
@app.get(""/items/"")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
    return [
        Item(name=""Portal Gun"", price=42.0),
        Item(name=""Plumbus"", price=32.0),
    ]
```
FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:

Data validation
Automatic documentation
It could power automatic client generators


Data filtering

Before this version it was only supported via the response_model parameter.

26,"Breaking Changes - Fixes

🐛 Fix response_model not invalidating None. PR #2725 by @hukkin.

If you are using response_model with some type that doesn't include None but the function is returning None, it will now raise an internal server error, because you are returning invalid data that violates the contract in response_model. Before this release it would allow breaking that contract returning None.
For example, if you have an app like this:
```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/invalidnone"", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```
...calling the path /items/invalidnone will raise an error, because None is not a valid type for the response_model declared with Item.
You could also be implicitly returning None without realizing, for example:
```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/invalidnone"", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    if flag:
        return {""name"": ""foo""}
    # if flag is False, at this point the function will implicitly return None
```
If you have path operations using response_model that need to be allowed to return None, make it explicit in response_model using Union[Something, None]:
```Python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/invalidnone"", response_model=Union[Item, None])
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```
This way the data will be correctly validated, you won't have an internal server error, and the documentation will also reflect that this path operation could return None (or null in JSON).

✨ Add support for omitting ... as default value when declaring required parameters with:


Path()

Query()
Header()
Cookie()
Body()
Form()
File()

New docs at Tutorial - Query Parameters and String Validations - Make it required. PR #4906 by @tiangolo.
Up to now, declaring a required parameter while adding additional validation or metadata needed using ... (Ellipsis).
For example:
```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/{item_id}"")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(default=..., gt=0),
    query: str = Query(default=..., max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(default=..., min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(default=..., title=""Tracing header""),
):
    return {""message"": ""Hello World""}
```
...all these parameters are required because the default value is ... (Ellipsis).
But now it's possible and supported to just omit the default value, as would be done with Pydantic fields, and the parameters would still be required.
✨ For example, this is now supported:
```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/{item_id}"")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: str = Query(max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(title=""Tracing header""),
):
    return {""message"": ""Hello World""}
```
To declare parameters as optional (not required), you can set a default value as always, for example using None:
```Python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(""/items/{item_id}"")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: Union[str, None] = Query(default=None, max_length=10),
    session: Union[str, None] = Cookie(default=None, min_length=3),
    x_trace: Union[str, None] = Header(default=None, title=""Tracing header""),
):
    return {""message"": ""Hello World""}
```

✨ Update internal AsyncExitStack to fix context for dependencies with yield. PR #4575 by @tiangolo.

Dependencies with yield can now catch HTTPException and custom exceptions. For example:
Python
async def get_database():
    with Session() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        except HTTPException:
            session.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            session.close()
After the dependency with yield handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal ServerErrorMiddleware.
If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with yield, and receiving an exception breaks the code after yield, you can use a block with try and finally:
Python
async def do_something():
    try:
        yield something
    finally:
        some_cleanup()
...that way the finally block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.
Features

The same PR #4575 from above also fixes the contextvars context for the code before and after yield. This was the main objective of that PR.

This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before yield, the value would still be available after yield (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.
For example, this works correctly now:
```Python
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
legacy_request_state_context_var: ContextVar[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = ContextVar(
    ""legacy_request_state_context_var"", default=None
)
async def set_up_request_state_dependency():
    request_state = {""user"": ""deadpond""}
    contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var.set(request_state)
    yield request_state
    legacy_request_state_context_var.reset(contextvar_token)
```
...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the contextvars context was different, because of the way it was implemented.
Note: You probably don't need contextvars, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's g semi-global variable.

🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR #2118 by @patrickkwang.

This change fixes a CSRF security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.
In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json).
So, a request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.
But requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.
See CVE-2021-32677 for more details.

✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR #2434 by @tiangolo.

Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router. That works well, but the call to app.include_router() or router.include_router() is normally done in another file.
That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.
Setting options in include_router still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter.
In FastAPI
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

default_response_class: updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router.
dependencies: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
callbacks: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations.
deprecated: to mark all the path operations as deprecated. 🤷
include_in_schema: to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema.
responses: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations.

For example:
```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
async def some_dependency():
    return
app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```
In APIRouter
This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

default_response_class: updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks.
dependencies: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with include_router.
callbacks: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.
deprecated: to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated.
include_in_schema: to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema.
responses: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router.
prefix: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling include_router.
tags: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router.

For example:
```Python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
async def some_dependency():
    return
router = APIRouter(prefix=""/users"", dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```
In include_router
Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter when possible.
But include_router is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies, prefix, and tags) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.
This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

default_response_class: updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and FastAPI.
deprecated: to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.
include_in_schema: to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema.
callbacks: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.

Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare dependencies in include_router.
Breaking Changes

PR #2434 includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for tags in include_router and path operations was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change.
If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's route.response_class, or the router.default_response_class, or the app.default_response_class: the default value for response_class in APIRoute and for default_response_class in APIRouter and FastAPI is now a DefaultPlaceholder used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the DefaultPlaceholder is available at route.response_class.value.

Add support for injecting HTTPConnection (as Request and WebSocket). Useful for sharing app state in dependencies. PR #1827 by @nsidnev.
Export WebSocketDisconnect and add example handling WebSocket disconnections to docs. PR #1822 by @rkbeatss.

Breaking Changes

Require Pydantic > 1.0.0.
Remove support for deprecated Pydantic 0.32.2. This improves maintainability and allows new features.
In FastAPI and APIRouter:
Remove path operation decorators related/deprecated parameter response_model_skip_defaults (use response_model_exclude_unset instead).
Change path operation decorators parameter default for response_model_exclude from set() to None (as is in Pydantic).


In encoders.jsonable_encoder:
Remove deprecated skip_defaults, use instead exclude_unset.
Set default of exclude from set() to None (as is in Pydantic).


PR #1862.


In encoders.jsonable_encoder remove parameter sqlalchemy_safe.
It was an early hack to allow returning SQLAlchemy models, but it was never documented, and the recommended way is using Pydantic's orm_mode as described in the tutorial: SQL (Relational) Databases.

Add support for ASGI root_path:
Use root_path internally for mounted applications, so that OpenAPI and the docs UI works automatically without extra configurations and parameters.
Add new root_path parameter for FastAPI applications to provide it in cases where it can be set with the command line (e.g. for Uvicorn and Hypercorn, with the parameter --root-path).
Deprecate openapi_prefix parameter in favor of the new root_path parameter.
Add new/updated docs for Sub Applications - Mounts, without openapi_prefix (as it is now handled automatically).
Add new/updated docs for Behind a Proxy, including how to setup a local testing proxy with Traefik and using root_path.

","Add support for ASGI root_path:
Use root_path internally for mounted applications, so that OpenAPI and the docs UI works automatically without extra configurations and parameters.
Add new root_path parameter for FastAPI applications to provide it in cases where it can be set with the command line (e.g. for Uvicorn and Hypercorn, with the parameter --root-path).
Deprecate openapi_prefix parameter in favor of the new root_path parameter.
Add new/updated docs for Sub Applications - Mounts, without openapi_prefix (as it is now handled automatically).
Add new/updated docs for Behind a Proxy, including how to setup a local testing proxy with Traefik and using root_path.
Update docs for Extending OpenAPI with the new openapi_prefix parameter passed (internally generated from root_path).

Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:

Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases.
The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using @property decorators) and several other use cases.
This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. my_item.name instead of my_item[""name""]) AND you use a response_model, make sure to update the Pydantic models with orm_mode = True as described in the docs (link above).
New documentation about receiving plain dicts as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrary dicts.
New documentation about returning arbitrary dicts in responses: Response with arbitrary dict.
Technical Details:
When declaring a response_model it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function.
Before this, the return content was first passed through jsonable_encoder to ensure it was a ""jsonable"" object, like a dict, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use orm_mode = True.
If you don't have a response_model, the return object will still be passed through jsonable_encoder first.
When a response_model is declared, the same response_model type declaration won't be used as is, it will be ""cloned"" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic Field with all the submodels cloned as well).
This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the response_model (e.g. you return a UserInDB that inherits from User but contains extra fields, like hashed_password, and User is used in the response_model), it would still pass the validation (because UserInDB is a subclass of User) and the object would be returned as-is, including the hashed_password. To fix this, the declared response_model is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a List[Item]), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the ""cloned"" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned response_model. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned response_model, containing only the declared fields as normally.

This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.

This also means that if a dependency was declared as a path operation decorator dependency, possibly at the router level (with .include_router()) and then it is declared again in a specific path operation, the dependency will be called only once.

Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add {your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).

Add support for dependencies parameter:

A parameter in path operation decorators, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the path operation function.
A parameter in the .include_router() method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each path operation in a router.
This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of path operations.
Different dependencies can be applied to different routers.


These dependencies are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in path operation decorators, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
