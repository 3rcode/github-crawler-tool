5,"📣 Overview
This is a big release that we've been working on for awhile. We want to highlight some of the new features available in this release which we think will make developer's lives much easier.
🔠  HTMLText
This release adds HTMLText. Previously this was available as a plugin but we have decided to make it available by default in pixi.js, pixi.js-legacy (the Web Worker and node bundles does not support HTMLText yet).
🌈 Color
We have standardized color inputs all over PixiJS by creating a Color class. No longer do some color inputs accept only integers, some accept RGBA floats, some strings. You can now use whatever color format you choose for things like backgroundColor, tint, Graphics fill and stroke, text colors. Color inputs include: #ff0000, #f00, ""red"", ""rgb(255, 0, 0)"", 0xff0000, and many more!
💻  Event Modes
The new event-based system that replaced InteractionManager from v6 still had some work in order to fully support old features. In order to bridge the gap, we have deprecated interactive (boolean) and replaced with eventMode. 
| eventMode | Description |
|---|---|
| none | Ignores all interaction events, similar to CSS's pointer-events: none, good optimization for non-interactive children |
|  passive  | Does not emit events and ignores hit testing on itself but does allow for events and hit testing only its interactive children. If you want to be compatible with v6, set this as your default eventMode (see options in Renderer, Application, etc) |
|  auto  | Does not emit events and but is hit tested if parent is interactive. Same as interactive = false in v7 |
|  static  | Emit events and is hit tested. Same as interaction = true in v7, useful for objects like buttons that do not move. |
|  dynamic | Emits events and is hit tested but will also receive mock interaction events fired from a ticker to allow for interaction when the mouse isn't moving. This is useful for elements that independently moving or animating. |
👟 Global Move Events
Introduces new global move events that are dispatched globally regardless of hit-testing the current object. These are similar to *move events in v6 and are useful for creating drag interactions with a reference to the main root stage Container.

globalpointermove
globaltouchmove
globalmousemove

❗ Other Important Changes
Node Bundle Moving
We have decided to move @pixi/node to it's own repository and will no longer be part of this repository. There are a few reasons: lack of adoption, burden of installing Node-based canvas and gl dependencies, stability of Adapter and extension APIs. We will continue to support this bundle but will do releases independent of PixiJS.
Return of peerDependencies
We reverted a major change in v7 which was to eliminate the use of peerDependencies. This unfortunately broke CDN delivery systems that ship ESM builds (jsdelivr, skypack, etc) also it had negative impact on new tools like Yarn 3. Because we rolled-back this change, it's very important that when you update PixiJS from now on, you complete remove the old version before installing the new one. Please see this wiki page on Upgrading PixiJS.

74,"💥  Breaking Changes
This version is largely compatible with v5 except for a few subtle differences:
Stricter Typings
TypeScript types have been completely re-generated and work for all packages. There are likely subtle differences between v5 types where the new types are much more exact. Also, we have removed the use of PIXI global namespace in typings. If you were previously using that you'll need to convert to module typings.
Removed v4 & v5 Deprecations
Deprecations from v4 and v5 have been removed. It's recommended that you fix all deprecation warnings using the latest v5 release before upgrading.
Change Renderer's Default alpha
The alpha property on the Renderer & Application options is true now by default. For the majority of uses, this change will not have any visible affect (but may improve performance b/c non-alpha mode emulation in software is expensive).
Change failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat Default
PIXI.settings.FAIL_IF_MAJOR_PERFORMANCE_CAVEAT is now false by default. See #7054 for more context.
SVG Images Load Type
The default load type with Loader for SVG images is now text instead of an HTMLImageElement. SVG images loaded with Loader are now SVGResource types instead of ImageResource.
Moved drawStar Method
Graphics drawStar method has been moved to @pixi/graphics-extras, if you're using that, you need to use this optional package (not included in pixi.js or pixi.js-legacy by default). This method was added before graphics-extras and belongs with those optional drawing functions.
Changed Default cacheAsBitmap Resolution Behavior
Prior to v6, the only want to change the resolution on something with cacheAsBitmap set to true was to change PIXI.settings.RESOLUTION. This is no longer the case. cacheAsBitmap now uses the Renderer's resolution by default with an optional local override cacheAsBitmapResolution
🚐  Migration
If you're using TypeScript, make sure the follow is added to your tsconfig.json:
js
{
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""moduleResolution"": ""node"",
    // Required for importing 3rd-party dependencies like EventEmitter3
    ""esModuleInterop"": true,
    // Loaders needs this to use the more strict mini-signal types
    ""paths"": {
      ""mini-signals"": [
        ""node_modules/resource-loader/typings/mini-signals.d.ts""
      ]
    },

🔧  Upgrade Notes

For TypeScript users upgrading from 5.2.x, note that Loader events (complete, error, load, start) are not longer supported in types (will only work runtime using the pixi.js or pixi.js-legacy with deprecations enabled). You'll need to upgrade your code to use Loader's signals instead, which have been available since 5.0.0. For example:

typescript
const loader = new Loader();
loader.on('complete', () => {}); // supported in < 5.3.0
loader.onComplete.add(() => {}); // supported in >= 5.0.0

Overview
This is the last major update for v5 which finally adds support for batching of Mesh, Graphics and Sprites. This will dramatically improve performance when using a scene that contains a large mix of these display objects. In addition, Geometry can now be shared between Graphics and Mesh's. This can be used to avoid redundant triangulation operations leading to further performance improvements.

125,"Overview
The goal of this release is to formalize the new core that was started in v5.0.0-alpha. In addition, the major overhaul to v5 is splitting the project up into a multi-package structure. This will allow developers to compose their own flavor of PixiJS without having to create a custom build. We think this is a huge improvement. 
Also, the major change for v5 is making canvas rendering a second-class citizen. The future of PixiJS will be WebGL 2 with fallback to WebGL 1, not context2d support. However, for many developers this is still pretty critical so we have created to bundles: pixi.js and pixi.js-legacy. The latter contains the most analogous code to v4. The former excludes CanvasRenderer and related canvas rendering functionality. Important: if you want to upgrade seamlessly, use the new package: pixi.js-legacy. 
⚠️ Known Issues

Right now pixi-filters typings are compatible, and pixi-spine are not, however pixi-spine is working with runtime. (#4760)
There is a masking issue when having using multiple masks. A specific set of circumstances will cause mask to hide completely their targets. 
The bundles pixi.js and pixi.js-legacy do not contains distribution, builds. Will fix in future publishing in the meantime use pixi.js and pixi.js-legacy for the latest releases.

Support for root-relative path in Spritesheet's image loading #3723 
Destroying Textures and BaseTextures does a more thorough clean-up. #3789 
TilingSprite tilePosition was affected by texture rotation. #3831 
Fixes support for AnimatedSprites with more than 1 source texture to the Prepare plugins #3830
Fixes problem with padding and trim in Text #3858 
Fixes ParticleContainer canvasRenderer resolution #3864
Fixes TilingSprite canvasRenderer resolution #3896
Excluding the loaders module npm run dist -- -e loaders now works correctly.  #3909

🎁 Added

Adds Spritesheet URL tests #3781
Adds textureCacheId to Texture, for giving a useful name to reference key in TextureCache. #3789 
Supports cacheAsBitmap for Sprite directly. #3855
Adds hitTest method to InteractionManager #3878 
Adds priority to Ticker handlers, adds the following APIs #3859 #3904
Ticker.prototype.add(fn, context, priority)
Ticker.prototype.addOnce(fn, context, priority)
PIXI.UPDATE_PRIORITY
Introduces loader property the Application class, e.g., app.loader.load() #3909
Adds constructor argument options.sharedLoader to Application to opt-in to using the shared Loader. #3909
Adds PIXI.loaders.shared as an alias for PIXI.loader (conforms to Ticker usage PIXI.ticker.shared). #3909
Adds new PIXI.TextMetrics class for calculating Text and Font layout sizes. Makes it possible to measure fitting size of text and and a TextStyle for doing auto-fitting of text. #3921 #3908
PIXI.TextMetrics.measureText method for calculating the size of text fill.
PIXI.TextMetrics.measureFont method for calculating the font max and min dimensions.

💰 Changed

Added alternative Application & Renderer Constructor signatures which add width and height to a single options object #3773 
Read texture directly via _texture in Sprite #3780 
Drops support for Bower #3772
Code consistency with texture.orig.* #3785
Splits the BasePrepare.register(addHook,uploadHook) into 2 separate methods registerFindHook and registerUploadHook #3830

🐛 Fixed

Fix for Graphics: get points for newly created shape #3363 
CocoonJS interaction position fix #3392 
Fix order of skew and scale in transform. Note: this resolves a long-standing issue with skew when combined with scale and may visually break project that rely heavily on working-around this bug.  #3382, fix #3424
Fix Graphics' getLocalBounds after generateCanvasTexture #3398 
TextStyle fixes #3405
Code clean up in TransformStatic.updateTransform #3404 #3435
Changes prioritizes the filename resolution (e.g. @2x). If that isn't set, it falls back to the scale value set in the JSON. Otherwise, resolution of 1. #3464 

✏️ Updated

Reduce Graphics.getlocalBounds test cruft #3397 
Doc updates #3401 #3399  #3470 #3471 

🎁 Added

Added

Multi texture renderering
Introduces PIXI.TextStyle class to manage the styling of text fields
Texture GPU Garbage Collection
Optimise the WebGL renderer, especially for mobiles.
Added Nineslice Plane
Webgl now powered by pixi-gl-core
static transforms - objects only updated if changed
Fast masking uses stencil buffer if a mask is Graphics Rectangle AABB
Fast Graphics Rect. If graphics object is Rectangle its is rendered as a sprite
reset GL function to allow pixi to work in the SAME context as other renderers (such as three.js)
added some bounds unit tests
Many, many, many, many bug fixes

Changed

Big refactoring of WebGL renderer.
New streamlined build process that is NPM based
Filter manager - no runs off po2 textures so less big textures required
Shaders now compiled with glslify
FXAA Filter now actually looks right (although no longer automatic)
Introduced Bounds object for much more accurate bounds calculations
Adds a contributor code of conduct #2844 
MultiSprite Batcher should now work with multiple renderers #2841
Default destroy options for text are now all true. #2847 

Removed

Complex poly masking. This added lots of complexity but was never really used as the earcut algorithm is too good.
FXAA no moved to filters rather than used automatically as a replacement for default antialiasing
Non core filters moved to a new package - pixi-filters

Complex poly masking. This added lots of complexity but was never really used as the earcut algorithm is too good.
FXAA no moved to filters rather than used automatically as a replacement for default antialiasing
Non core filters moved to a new package - pixi-filters"

webGL renderer is now fully compatible with IE11
Fully compatible with Cocoon.js (@ekelokorpi)
Fixed issue where PIXI.TilingSprite required a power of two texture. It now accepts any texture.
Added new tint example
Added new blendMode example
Added cacheAsBitmap to PIXI.Graphics object. Useful for complex graphics objects. Also a great way to guarantee antialiasing on graphics objects in webGL as it renders using canvas
Added generateTexture to PIXI.Graphics object. This function returns a PIXI.Texture of the graphics object. Useful if the graphics objects as is used multiple times
Added AlphaMaskFilter

200,"v1.3.0 is here!
So whats new? Basically Its faster and does more stuff:

Spine runtime is now much more robust with lots of little tweaks and bug fixes to make it more compatible. 
Spine runtime now supports skins.
New Spine example (goblins) added to show how skins work.
RequestAnimationFrame Polyfill updated.
Custom object hitAreas can now be circles / rectangles / or polys.
WebGL Shader optimised by removing projection matrix.
Rendering now uses linked list to traverse objects increasing render speeds.
Optimised addChild function. Its now way faster.
Added new graphics object allowing for primitive drawing.
New example added to showcase the graphics object.
Added masks. A graphics object can now be used to mask another pixi object.
New example added to showcase masking.
Src code organised into nice new structure.
Option to enable/disable antialiasing when creating a webGL renderer.
Original mouse events now passed along to pixi interaction events.
PreventDefault is now not called by the interaction manager on mouse down / touchStart.
setInteractive replaced with the getter/setter interactive.
Lots of other little bug fixes and tweaks that make pixi even better.

We hope you find this update useful, Enjoy!","v1.3.0 is here!
