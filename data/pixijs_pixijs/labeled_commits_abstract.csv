Cleanup BatchRenderer internal names and documentation (#5852),0.9999999,Cleanup BatchRenderer internal names and documentation (#5852),"I have edited the BatchRenderer class. The following major changes were made: Changed old vertexCount to _flushId. This is because the name itself was misleading. It signified the number of flushes in the current frame. Renamed vaos and vaosMax to _packedGeometries and _packedGeometryPoolSize. They were not VAOs in the sense that they binded all the buffers automatically to the WebGL context. Instead, they were just reusable BatchGeometry objects. Renamed groups to _drawCalls. That is what they are, and it makes more sense, especially after documenting it. Renamed all private variables by adding a _ prefix. Added documentation to all private/public properties and methods. Fixed destroy(). It was nullifying non-existent variables. They were probably from when this class was being built/tested. I've fixed it so that it nullifies the correct resources. contextChange signal is now hooked in BatchRenderer rather than the BatchPluginFactory#create. This makes sense since the former is the one implementing the contextChange signal. SIDE EFFECT: Graphics used the shader property of BatchRenderer, and since that was deemed a private properties, it broke. It fixed that by making Graphics use _shader. I reordered the way in which properties are initialized in the constructor. The most important/public ones are on the top. They are ordered in a way that makes a new-comer sense. Reordered methods. The first methods are related to rendering and are lifecycle-type methods: contextChange, render, flush, and destroy. Then the start and stop methods. Then the private methods getAttributeBuffer, getIndexBuffer, and packInterleavedGeometry. Renamed packGeometry to packInterleavedGeometry; this is because the method doesn't take any geometry to put into. Rather it takes the interleaved buffers. Documented literally anything else.",1

"Measure Text API, expanded (#3921)",0.6483371,Adds ability to customize strings in TextMetrics.measureFont() (#4550),Added TextStyle.measure function (Applies to link). Moved measure function from TextStyle to Text and made static. Updated JSDocs. Updated JSDocs again. Updates based on suggestions by @bigtimebuddy in PR. Created PIXI.MeasuredText to capture all the information for measuring text. Fixes for ESLint Fixes for ESLint Added PIXI prefix to returning MeasuredText. Added import for MeasuredText in Text.js. Refactored MeasuredText to TextMetrics and moved measure function into it. Forgot to move Text.wordWrap to TextMetrics.wordWrap Further cleanup of TextMetrics. Fixes suggested by @bigtimebuddy Removed clone and equals from TextMetrics as they are unnecessary. Destructured references to TextMetrics instance in Text and privatized TextMetrics.wordWrap. Deprecates calculateFontProperties & getFontStyle Moved getFontStyle to TextMetrics Made toFontString method on TextStyle Cache calls made to context.measureText for individual characters Use a smaller (10x10) canvas for TextMetrics,0

Improvements to how and what is stored in the texture caches. (#3834),0.6828106,Texture states caching #3201,"Improvements to how and what is stored in the texture caches. Built upon the good work from link For Text, the base textures were in the BaseTextureCache, but textures weren't in the TextureCache. This has been fixed Now able to tell the BaseTexture the origin of where the canvas being passed through has come from. ie. was it from the text class? was it from the graphic class? was it from caching as a bitmap? More information now to track where these canvases (canvii??) have been generated from BaseTexture has addBaseTextureToCache and removeBaseTextureFromCache functions, to match regular Texture. Any adding or removing to the BaseTextureCache is now through these functions ! Breaking change. When you call Texture.fromTextureFromCache - it no longer automatically removes it's base texture from the base texture cache. Not sure how people feel about this ? I don't like lines 233 to 236 in Texture.js, and line 591 in BaseTexture.js - I don't see why they are there or why they are needed, but I chickened out on removing them! Renaming function to more generic names Adding deprecation layer Fixed trying to add texture to BaseTexture cache causing unit test fail Fixed reading from the wrong cache Able to remove textures and base textures from their caches via object instances Added debug warning if trying to add a texture to a cache id that already exists Added unit tests Default string for texture origin Different object creation style textureCacheId is now an array of potential entries textureCacheId changed to textureCacheIds Removed unneeded string creation",0

Test Case There is some common codes of test cases : module TEST 1 If no  currentPath = null ,  the second arc can't be rendered, and there is no error on browser's console. ```js var graphics = new PIXI.Graphics(); stage.addChild(graphics); // clear manually renderer.clear(); graphics.clear(); graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000); graphics.arc(150, 160, 100, 0, Math.PI * 2, false); graphics.endFill(); // draw  the first shape     renderer.render(stage); graphics.clear(); graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF); graphics.arc(150+50, 160+50, 100, 0, Math.PI * 2, false); graphics.endFill(); // draw  the second shape     renderer.render(stage); module     var graphics = new PIXI.Graphics();     stage.addChild(graphics); // clear manually renderer.clear(); graphics.clear(); graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000); graphics.drawRect(150, 160, 100, 60); graphics.endFill(); // draw the first shape graphics.updateTransform(); graphics.renderWebGL(renderer); graphics.clear(); graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF); graphics.drawRect(150+50, 160+50, 100, 60); graphics.endFill(); // draw the second shape graphics.updateTransform(); graphics.renderWebGL(renderer); // flush manually renderer.flush(); ``` Summary If don't call  graphics.clear(); before draw the second shape , there will be another error. If add  this.currentPath = null;         this._spriteRect = null; in clear() everything will be OK, and I test many other examples, this patch doesn't break anything else, it's safe. I know when we want to draw multi shapes , we could use multi graphics objects. But we shouldn't prevent users to use one shared graphics to draw multi shapes. Remove trailing spaces.",0

Restore lost context before using it; fixes #2958,0.80899644,- Fix an issue with context restore (#1788).,Looks like since we call loseContext() on WebGLRenderer#destroy() that if you create another WebGLRenderer with the same canvas the browser will recycle that lost context and return it. This means when we try to use the context it is actually in a lost state. This change tries to restore a lost context before we use it.

VideoBaseTexture fixes and changes,0.57122576,VideoBaseTexture createSource should not modify the url. (#5170),"* link didn't fully solve the video loading issues; the examples page for videos still doesn't work. I've tracked that down to the static 'fromUrl' function, which called video.play(). This was a tad early, resulting in width and height being 0. Removing the .play here doesn't matter, as it is still automatically called within _onCanPlay() * autoUpdate changed to a getter/setter. It's previous doc stated that it could be used to control when autoUpdating happened, but this wasn't true, it was actually just an internal variable to check whether it was currently auto updating or not. I've create a couple of private tracking variable for the state, whilst the public getter / setting now truely controls autoUpdating and can be changed on the fly. * moved this class to use the ticker. My expectation as a dev is that if I stop the shared ticker, PIXI would stop, but VideoBaseTexture was an exception as it used rAF directly.",0

Documentation - Array(Normalization),0.32158774,Add out param to Matrix#toArray,"YUIDoc does not have a standard (or really any) way of describing inner types of arrays and there are two general forms used in the current pixi code: Array Array An array of X, or an inconsistent variation of such The first form is not even parsed correctly by the YUIDoc tool and the contained type, X, does not appear in the documentation output (or parsed data) at all. Other similar forms that fail to work are: X[], Array{X}m and Array.. The second form mixes the type (Array) and the description of the type (""An array of X""). It would suiting to say ""Array of X"". Thus thus commit changes both of the above forms into a normalized Array(X) While I do not want to impose this as the final chosen representation for such types, it does immediately address the documentation issues mentioned above and renders the nested type name in the documentation output. If a better method or converntion is found this consistent and generatable intermim VB-like syntax can be trivially found and replaced. Another alternative of course, it to forbid anything more complex than Array as a type.",0

Add clearBeforeRender for ,0.42360872,            this.dirty = false;,"Maybe ""clearBeforeRender"" this is not the best naming (since it will clear anyway..), but this aligns canvas and webgl: Basically it allows the user to do clearColor whenever they want, instead of this being done for them. This is useful in the following circumstance: 1) The game/program loads a background image, but not right away. 2) Before the background image is loaded, we want to fill the canvas with a certain color (for example, white). 3) In canvas mode, this is done by setting clearBeforeRender to false and then adding a single fillRect command. 4) In webGL mode, the equivalent is running gl.clearColor and then gl.clear. 5) We can of course set the background color in webGL mode and this probably won't be expensive (although I don't know), but in canvas it is expensive to clear/fill on every frame. 6) Thus, the user would have to detect webGL mode or canvas mode themselves, and either set the background color or not. 7) To eliminate this coding complexity for the user, this small bit of extra code aligns clearBeforeRender (or, as much as possible) to the canvas implementation.",0

Updated Gruntfile to use the renamed GrayFilter and fixed indexAll in Example 15 to use the GrayFilter as well.",0.61664176,"Also, the major change for v5 is making canvas rendering a second-class citizen. The future of PixiJS will be WebGL 2 with fallback to WebGL 1, not context2d support. However, for many developers this is still pretty critical so we have created to bundles: pixi.js and pixi.js-legacy. The latter contains the most analogous code to v4. The former excludes CanvasRenderer and related canvas rendering functionality. Important: if you want to upgrade seamlessly, use the new package: pixi.js-legacy. ",,0

Updated renderers to accept a view,0.5563926,Update typings for RenderTextureSystem (#5755),"The reason for this commit is to allow support for previously created canvases to be specified as views. The major usecase here is Ejecta, who's primary screen canvas is always obtained through document.getElementById('canvas'); Thus, creating a canvas using document.createElement('canvas') would only make an offscreen canvas which wouldn't be visible. This commit maintains backwards compatibility since specifying a canvas is completely optional, and if none is specified, it falls back to previous behaviour.",0
