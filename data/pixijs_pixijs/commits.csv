This is because the name itself was misleading. It signified the number of flushes in the current frame.   Renamed vaos and vaosMax to _packedGeometries and _packedGeometryPoolSize. They were not VAOs in the sense that they binded all the buffers automatically to the WebGL context. Instead, they were just reusable BatchGeometry objects.   Renamed groups to _drawCalls. That is what they are, and it makes more sense, especially after documenting it.   Renamed all private variables by adding a _ prefix.   Added documentation to all private/public properties and methods.   Fixed destroy(). It was nullifying non-existent variables. They were probably from when this class was being built/tested. I've fixed it so that it nullifies the correct resources.   contextChange signal is now hooked in BatchRenderer rather than the BatchPluginFactory#create. This makes sense since the former is the one implementing the contextChange signal.   SIDE EFFECT: Graphics used the shader property of BatchRenderer, and since that was deemed a private properties, it broke. It fixed that by making Graphics use _shader.   I reordered the way in which properties are initialized in the constructor. The most important/public ones are on the top. They are ordered in a way that makes a new-comer sense.   Reordered methods. The first methods are related to rendering and are lifecycle-type methods: contextChange, render, flush, and destroy. Then the start and stop methods. Then the private methods getAttributeBuffer, getIndexBuffer, and packInterleavedGeometry.   Renamed packGeometry to packInterleavedGeometry; this is because the method doesn't take any geometry to put into. Rather it takes the interleaved buffers.   Documented literally anything else.

Built upon the good work from https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/pull/3789 For Text, the base textures were in the BaseTextureCache, but textures weren't in the TextureCache. This has been fixed Now able to tell the BaseTexture the origin of where the canvas being passed through has come from. ie. was it from the text class? was it from the graphic class? was it from caching as a bitmap? More information now to track where these canvases (canvii??) have been generated from BaseTexture has addBaseTextureToCache and removeBaseTextureFromCache functions, to match regular Texture. Any adding or removing to the BaseTextureCache is now through these functions  ! Breaking change. When you call Texture.fromTextureFromCache - it no longer automatically removes it's base texture from the base texture cache. Not sure how people feel about this ? I don't like lines 233 to 236 in Texture.js, and line 591 in BaseTexture.js - I don't see why they are there or why they are needed, but I chickened out on removing them!   Renaming function to more generic names   Adding deprecation layer   Fixed trying to add texture to BaseTexture cache causing unit test fail   Fixed reading from the wrong cache   Able to remove textures and base textures from their caches via object instances Added debug warning if trying to add a texture to a cache id that already exists Added unit tests   Default string for texture origin   Different object creation style   textureCacheId is now an array of potential entries   textureCacheId changed to textureCacheIds   Removed unneeded string creation ",Improvements to how and what is stored in the texture caches.

This has been fixed Now able to tell the BaseTexture the origin of where the canvas being passed through has come from. ie. was it from the text class? was it from the graphic class? was it from caching as a bitmap? More information now to track where these canvases (canvii??) have been generated from BaseTexture has addBaseTextureToCache and removeBaseTextureFromCache functions, to match regular Texture. Any adding or removing to the BaseTextureCache is now through these functions ! Breaking change. When you call Texture.fromTextureFromCache - it no longer automatically removes it's base texture from the base texture cache. Not sure how people feel about this ? I don't like lines 233 to 236 in Texture.js, and line 591 in BaseTexture.js - I don't see why they are there or why they are needed, but I chickened out on removing them! Renaming function to more generic names Adding deprecation layer Fixed trying to add texture to BaseTexture cache causing unit test fail Fixed reading from the wrong cache Able to remove textures and base textures from their caches via object instances Added debug warning if trying to add a texture to a cache id that already exists Added unit tests Default string for texture origin Different object creation style textureCacheId is now an array of potential entries textureCacheId changed to textureCacheIds Removed unneeded string creation"

This means when we try to use the context it is actually in a lost state. This change tries to restore a lost context before we use it. It also adds a debug assert at one location that will be invalid if the context is invalid.,Restore lost context before using it; fixes #2958,Looks like since we call loseContext() on WebGLRenderer#destroy() that if you create another WebGLRenderer with the same canvas the browser will recycle that lost context and return it.

5381,Add clearBeforeRender for ,"Maybe ""clearBeforeRender"" this is not the best naming (since it will clear anyway..), but this aligns canvas and webgl: Basically it allows the user to do clearColor whenever they want, instead of this being done for them. This is useful in the following circumstance: 1) The game/program loads a background image, but not right away. 2) Before the background image is loaded, we want to fill the canvas with a certain color (for example, white). 3) In canvas mode, this is done by setting clearBeforeRender to false and then adding a single fillRect command. 4) In webGL mode, the equivalent is running gl.clearColor and then gl.clear. 5) We can of course set the background color in webGL mode and this probably won't be expensive (although I don't know), but in canvas it is expensive to clear/fill on every frame. 6) Thus, the user would have to detect webGL mode or canvas mode themselves, and either set the background color or not. 7) To eliminate this coding complexity for the user, this small bit of extra code aligns clearBeforeRender (or, as much as possible) to the canvas implementation.",Add clearBeforeRender for ,"Maybe ""clearBeforeRender"" this is not the best naming (since it will clear anyway..), but this aligns canvas and webgl: Basically it allows the user to do clearColor whenever they want, instead of this being done for them.

Allows the dev to control if fillRect / clearRect is called (as it's not needed for lots of games and can help perf slightly on legacy devices). Also added PX_ROUND boolean. If true (default is false) it will Math.floor the x/y values on the transform, this stops interpolation when Sprites are rendered at non-pixel values, keeping pixel art crisp. Also helps performance on older mobiles.
