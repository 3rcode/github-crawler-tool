Suggest predis instead of requiring it,0.91202366,Suggest predis instead of requiring it (#531),"Just like laravel/framework which suggests predis (and people can choose to use phpredis instead), Horizon should suggest it so people using phpredis do not needlessly install a dependency.

Requiring the user to install phpredis or predis herself is no different from what other parts of Laravel using Redis already do.",1

Expire monitored jobs,0.90171355,Expire monitored jobs (#484),This commit fixes the problem where completed jobs which were monitored by a tag are stored indefinitely and end up filling up the DB and cause the system to run out of memory.

By default this is set to 7 days. The listener itself will run one time each day. Fixes https://github.com/laravel/horizon/issues/271,1

Fix storing floats in Redis,0.97317815,Fix storing floats in Redis (#477),Redis will only accept floats with a point decimal sign and not a comma decimal sign. The sign is determined by the system's locale setting (LC_NUMERIC) and if set to one that prefers a comma will cause Redis to store the float as a string instead of a comma. This change will make sure that before a float is stored it's always made sure that any comma is changed to a point. This was already done in some other parts of the system.

[5.6] Support block_for config option,0.34155864,Adjust configuration for 5.8 default configuration (f1f830e),"See https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/22284 I actually find Horizon without blpop to have really bad latency in processing new jobs if idle. Using blocking pop reduces latency significantly. Personally, I think it should default to using blpop. Without it, you need to wait until the next worker ends its cooldown cycle for the job to get picked up. If it's doing a blocking pop, redis will instead serve a job to a worker immediately as it enters the queue if there's an idle worker waiting for them. This really speeds things up. This option is in the 5.6 branch, so I guess this'll need to wait until 5.6 is released, but I'd love it if this was also backported to 5.5 (I don't think it should break BC?)",0
