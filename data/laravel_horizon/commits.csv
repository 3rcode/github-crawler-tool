845,Expire monitored jobs,This commit fixes the problem where completed jobs which were monitored by a tag are stored indefinitely and end up filling up the DB and cause the system to run out of memory. The main problem at hand was that these jobs were never cleaned up. By adding the max TTL and TrimMonitoredJobs listener the monitored jobs will be cleaned up after the given amount of time. By default this is set to 7 days. The listener itself will run one time each day.

851,Fix storing floats in Redis,Redis will only accept floats with a point decimal sign and not a comma decimal sign. The sign is determined by the system's locale setting (LC_NUMERIC) and if set to one that prefers a comma will cause Redis to store the float as a string instead of a comma. This change will make sure that before a float is stored it's always made sure that any comma is changed to a point. This was already done in some other parts of the system.
