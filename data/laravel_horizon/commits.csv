849,Expire monitored jobs,This commit fixes the problem where completed jobs which were monitored by a tag are stored indefinitely and end up filling up the DB and cause the system to run out of memory. The main problem at hand was that these jobs were never cleaned up. By adding the max TTL and TrimMonitoredJobs listener the monitored jobs will be cleaned up after the given amount of time. By default this is set to 7 days. The listener itself will run one time each day.

855,Fix storing floats in Redis,Redis will only accept floats with a point decimal sign and not a comma decimal sign. The sign is determined by the system's locale setting (LC_NUMERIC) and if set to one that prefers a comma will cause Redis to store the float as a string instead of a comma.

Without it, you need to wait until the next worker ends its cooldown cycle for the job to get picked up. If it's doing a blocking pop, redis will instead serve a job to a worker immediately as it enters the queue if there's an idle worker waiting for them. This really speeds things up. This option is in the 5.6 branch, so I guess this'll need to wait until 5.6 is released, but I'd love it if this was also backported to 5.5 (I don't think it should break BC?)"
