Note:  * jsdom is making it harder to stub things, so we inject a jest-friendly    window into the router. I'm not a huge fan of DI when used solely for the    sake of testing, but this seems less terrible than other approaches (e.g.    (patch-package-ing jsdom, or monkey-patching Object.defineProperty) 🙃  * We use a yarn resolution to get the latest jsdom, despite the latest    jest pinning it at ^20.0.0. Per the maintainers, this is fine as jest    doesn't need any code changes to work with new jsdom, and there are no    concrete plans yet to ship a major version.",chore: upgrade jest and jsdom (#10453),"This lets us remove a polyfill and some other hacks, and brings along some additional jsdom features which will facilitate testing fixes to submitter serialization.

This updated version is easier to read and makes more sense semantically because it is changing the emphasize of the sentence. With the previous sentence structure, the activity of the link is being made predominant; this is redundant imo since the basic action of what a link does is implicit in the context. In other words, everyone knows what a link does - there is no reason to highlight this in the sentence structure.  The new sentence structure instead highlights the link location as the predominant object of this sentence rather than the action of the link.

This also means that we don't mutate context.router anymore (no more Object.assign). Instead, context.router was split into two parts: context.history and context.route (the  props + match). This allows us to leave context.history untouched and change context.route only according to the props + match state of each . withRouter was also updated to provide everything in a ""router"" prop instead of spreading all props to the component.",Remove subscriptions,"This commit builds upon (and supersedes) the work done by @ryanflorence in #4598 to remove subscriptions from the codebase.

Let’s hope it doesn’t get abused 🙏🏼 Some notes: Theoretically, with this change we could ditch the entire subscription model. We could have the top level Router subscribe to history and setState, providing location on context. Then Routes would get updates naturally and access location from context. The problem is that shouldComponentUpdate will block deep updates to Routes. This is why we introduced subscriptions in the first place. With a location prop, however, apps could pass the location in to Routes that are behind a sCU. For example, in Redux, you would have location in your store, and then make a ConnectedRoute that gets the location from there instead of context. But that’s for a different day. The React team tells us “accessing data on context is unreliable, please use subscriptions” and so we do, which unfortunately opts us completely out of the setState update model, which is why this location prop is necessary to opt-back into it for animations. fixes #4351",Add location prop to Route and Switch,"As far as we know, this is only useful for animations where you want a subsequent render to use the old props (the way ReactTransitionGroup saves off the previous children).

Per-route overrides are not supported, but you can supply a custom strategy object. This also fixes #252. Migration path: The default changed from what corresponded to imitateBrowser, to scrollToTop.

Unfortunately the used currentPath is not valid for the location strategies hash and history. This change changes URLStore.push so that it uses the location strategy specific current path.
