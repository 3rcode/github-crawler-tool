This updated version is easier to read and makes more sense semantically because it is changing the emphasize of the sentence. With the previous sentence structure, the activity of the link is being made predominant; this is redundant imo since the basic action of what a link does is implicit in the context. In other words, everyone knows what a link does - there is no reason to highlight this in the sentence structure.  The new sentence structure instead highlights the link location as the predominant object of this sentence rather than the action of the link.

Instead of subscribing to location changes and using forceUpdate inside every , we better follow React's model by using setState in  and letting changes trickle down to descendants using React's built-in state propagation mechanism. This also means that we don't mutate context.router anymore (no more Object.assign). Instead, context.router was split into two parts: context.history and context.route (the  props + match). This allows us to leave context.history untouched and change context.route only according to the props + match state of each . withRouter was also updated to provide everything in a ""router"" prop instead of spreading all props to the component.",Remove subscriptions,"This commit builds upon (and supersedes) the work done by @ryanflorence in #4598 to remove subscriptions from the codebase.

Let’s hope it doesn’t get abused 🙏🏼 Some notes: Theoretically, with this change we could ditch the entire subscription model. We could have the top level Router subscribe to history and setState, providing location on context. Then Routes would get updates naturally and access location from context. The problem is that shouldComponentUpdate will block deep updates to Routes. This is why we introduced subscriptions in the first place. With a location prop, however, apps could pass the location in to Routes that are behind a sCU. For example, in Redux, you would have location in your store, and then make a ConnectedRoute that gets the location from there instead of context. But that’s for a different day. The React team tells us “accessing data on context is unreliable, please use subscriptions” and so we do, which unfortunately opts us completely out of the setState update model, which is why this location prop is necessary to opt-back into it for animations. fixes #4351",Add location prop to Route and Switch,"As far as we know, this is only useful for animations where you want a subsequent render to use the old props (the way ReactTransitionGroup saves off the previous children).

5499,"[changed] Remove preserveScrollPosition, add scrollStrategy","This removes support for preserveScrollPosition due to its unforunate naming. Instead, we introduce three scrolling strategies:  none: Router doesn't scroll the window when routes change scrollToTop (default): Router always scrolls to top when routes change imitateBrowser: Router tries to act like browser acts with server-rendered pages: it scrolls to top when clicking on links, but tries to restore position when navigating back and forward  You can only specify these on . Per-route overrides are not supported, but you can supply a custom strategy object. This also fixes #252. Migration path: The default changed from what corresponded to imitateBrowser, to scrollToTop. If router's server-rendered scrolling imitation worked well for you, you must now specify it explicitly: ``` // before   // after  ``` If you wish router to not try to manage scrolling, you must opt out: ``` // before  // after  ``` Also, as a third option, you may now use the simple scrollToTop strategy.","[changed] Remove preserveScrollPosition, add scrollStrategy","This removes support for preserveScrollPosition due to its unforunate naming.
