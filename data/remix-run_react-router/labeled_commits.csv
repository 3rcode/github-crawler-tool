Note:  * jsdom is making it harder to stub things, so we inject a jest-friendly    window into the router. I'm not a huge fan of DI when used solely for the    sake of testing, but this seems less terrible than other approaches (e.g.    (patch-package-ing jsdom, or monkey-patching Object.defineProperty) 🙃  * We use a yarn resolution to get the latest jsdom, despite the latest    jest pinning it at ^20.0.0. Per the maintainers, this is fine as jest    doesn't need any code changes to work with new jsdom, and there are no    concrete plans yet to ship a major version.",1

Fix greedy * in route paths,0.8111603,A * in a child route path matches after a slash following its parent route path. This fixes some situations where the * was overly greedy (see #7972),"This prevents * from matching without a preceding / in the URL pathname. So e.g. /users/* matches /users/mj but not /userstypo. This also fixes to=""."" in splat routes so they point to the route path including the portion of the URL that was matched by the *, which also makes * more consistent with :param since it's treated just the same as any other param. There is however a subtle breaking change if you are using the low-level match API, e.g. the match object you get back from matchRoutes() or useMatch(). match.pathname in a splat route now includes the full URL pathname that was matched instead of only the portion before the *. There is a new variable, match.pathnameStart that you can use if you needed this for doing your own route matching. Fixes #7972",1

This updated version is easier to read and makes more sense semantically because it is changing the emphasize of the sentence. With the previous sentence structure, the activity of the link is being made predominant; this is redundant imo since the basic action of what a link does is implicit in the context. In other words, everyone knows what a link does - there is no reason to highlight this in the sentence structure.  The new sentence structure instead highlights the link location as the predominant object of this sentence rather than the action of the link. Highlighting the location rather than action of the sentence is more fitting given that the context of what this method does (i.e. accepts a location to match).

Getting to the router context will be easier in future versions of React Router, so the main motivations for needing it will be going away.

This also means that we don't mutate context.router anymore (no more Object.assign). Instead, context.router was split into two parts: context.history and context.route (the  props + match). This allows us to leave context.history untouched and change context.route only according to the props + match state of each . withRouter was also updated to provide everything in a ""router"" prop instead of spreading all props to the component.",0

Add location prop to Route and Switch,0.6287211,"// if you're not a route component, you need to pass location down the","As far as we know, this is only useful for animations where you want a subsequent render to use the old props (the way ReactTransitionGroup saves off the previous children). Let’s hope it doesn’t get abused 🙏🏼 Some notes: Theoretically, with this change we could ditch the entire subscription model. We could have the top level Router subscribe to history and setState, providing location on context. Then Routes would get updates naturally and access location from context. The problem is that shouldComponentUpdate will block deep updates to Routes. This is why we introduced subscriptions in the first place. With a location prop, however, apps could pass the location in to Routes that are behind a sCU. For example, in Redux, you would have location in your store, and then make a ConnectedRoute that gets the location from there instead of context. But that’s for a different day. The React team tells us “accessing data on context is unreliable, please use subscriptions” and so we do, which unfortunately opts us completely out of the setState update model, which is why this location prop is necessary to opt-back into it for animations. fixes #4351",0

This approach requires the user to specify that they want the match made available through the context, and could lead to issues with users that neglect to wrap a nested <Route>'s component in a matchProvider and end up accessing the match of a grandparent <Route>.

A couple of things that make this immediately valuable:   instead of 3000 <!—-react empty 123—-> for each non-matching` in the dom, only one match renders in place there.   animations should be more straightforward since you should be able to   use <TransitionGroup> just like any other situation where a child is   changing (rather than one sibling rendering an another not!)   And some “maybe this will make things simpler” use cases:   its a solid “Plan B” for the Match/Miss dance. Fibers has me   sufficiently freaked out.   this might make server rendering 404s simpler? not sure about that yet   but definitely the top level patterns.   It might be an AMAZING way to migrate from v3 to v4, check this out, I   think will work.   ```jsx        (            )}/>  ``` Could even wrap all that junk up into <Route> components 🤔😯",0

We get a few benefits from this:   Routes may now be created programmatically, as well as via JSX.    This is useful in situations where it is desirable to assemble    the route configuration using separate modules, instead of all    at once. For example, in ApplicationRoute.js you could have: module.exports = Router.createRoute();   and in UserProfileRoute.js: var ApplicationRoute = require('./ApplicationRoute');  module.exports = Router.createRoute({   parentRoute: ApplicationRoute,   path: 'users/:id' });     may reference a Route object directly.    Route names may be re-used at different levels of the hierarchy.    For example, you could have two different routes named ""new"" but    nested inside different parent routes.           Using this route configuration, you could  or     depending on which one you wanted. A side    effect of this is that names of nested routes are no longer ""global"",    so e.g.  won't work because it is ambiguous, but     will still work.",1

This causes the parameters passed down to React components from the router to potentially be different in Firefox vs. other browsers.  Additionally, hashes containing the string '%25' can cause react-router to throw exceptions, since this value will be decoded to '%' by Firefox, and then passed by react-router to the decodeURI function, which will consider it invalid unless it is followed by two more hex digits. In order to fix these problems, reads of window.location.hash have been replaced with window.location.href.split('#')[1], which is consistently the un-decoded string in all browsers.",1

This commit completely disables scroll updates when only query has changed. This provides a reasonable default behavior and leaves ignoreScrollBehavior for more complicated cases.

"[changed] Remove preserveScrollPosition, add scrollStrategy",0.7595023,preserveScrollPosition -> scrollBehavior,"This removes support for preserveScrollPosition due to its unforunate naming. Instead, we introduce three scrolling strategies:  none: Router doesn't scroll the window when routes change scrollToTop (default): Router always scrolls to top when routes change imitateBrowser: Router tries to act like browser acts with server-rendered pages: it scrolls to top when clicking on links, but tries to restore position when navigating back and forward  You can only specify these on . Per-route overrides are not supported, but you can supply a custom strategy object. This also fixes #252. Migration path: The default changed from what corresponded to imitateBrowser, to scrollToTop. If router's server-rendered scrolling imitation worked well for you, you must now specify it explicitly: ``` // before   // after  ``` If you wish router to not try to manage scrolling, you must opt out: ``` // before  // after  ``` Also, as a third option, you may now use the simple scrollToTop strategy.",1
