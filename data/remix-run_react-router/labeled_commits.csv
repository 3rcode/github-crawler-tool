1311,Merge pull request #90 from benjohnson/active-route,0.61344445,58e7b98 [changed] activeRoute -> activeRouteHandler,"This prevents * from matching without a preceding / in the URL pathname. So e.g. /users/* matches /users/mj but not /userstypo. This also fixes to=""."" in splat routes so they point to the route path including the portion of the URL that was matched by the *, which also makes * more consistent with :param since it's treated just the same as any other param. There is however a subtle breaking change if you are using the low-level match API, e.g. the match object you get back from matchRoutes() or useMatch(). match.pathname in a splat route now includes the full URL pathname that was matched instead of only the portion before the *. There is a new variable, match.pathnameStart that you can use if you needed this for doing your own route matching. Fixes #7972",0

This updated version is easier to read and makes more sense semantically because it is changing the emphasize of the sentence. With the previous sentence structure, the activity of the link is being made predominant; this is redundant imo since the basic action of what a link does is implicit in the context. In other words, everyone knows what a link does - there is no reason to highlight this in the sentence structure.  The new sentence structure instead highlights the link location as the predominant object of this sentence rather than the action of the link. Highlighting the location rather than action of the sentence is more fitting given that the context of what this method does (i.e. accepts a location to match).

It seems as though our import of react-router-config was bringing in modules from react-router/Foo, while our named imports from react-router was bringing in modules from react-router/es/Foo. As a workaround, I've set up a webpack alias to avoid the duplication, but I think this should be solved in this package so that everyone can benefit. I believe this is similar to:  https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/pull/5589",0

Instead of subscribing to location changes and using forceUpdate inside every , we better follow React's model by using setState in  and letting changes trickle down to descendants using React's built-in state propagation mechanism. This also means that we don't mutate context.router anymore (no more Object.assign). Instead, context.router was split into two parts: context.history and context.route (the  props + match). This allows us to leave context.history untouched and change context.route only according to the props + match state of each . withRouter was also updated to provide everything in a ""router"" prop instead of spreading all props to the component.",0

Let’s hope it doesn’t get abused 🙏🏼 Some notes: Theoretically, with this change we could ditch the entire subscription model. We could have the top level Router subscribe to history and setState, providing location on context. Then Routes would get updates naturally and access location from context. The problem is that shouldComponentUpdate will block deep updates to Routes. This is why we introduced subscriptions in the first place. With a location prop, however, apps could pass the location in to Routes that are behind a sCU. For example, in Redux, you would have location in your store, and then make a ConnectedRoute that gets the location from there instead of context. But that’s for a different day. The React team tells us “accessing data on context is unreliable, please use subscriptions” and so we do, which unfortunately opts us completely out of the setState update model, which is why this location prop is necessary to opt-back into it for animations. fixes #4351",0

A couple of things that make this immediately valuable:   instead of 3000 <!—-react empty 123—-> for each non-matching` in the dom, only one match renders in place there.   animations should be more straightforward since you should be able to   use <TransitionGroup> just like any other situation where a child is   changing (rather than one sibling rendering an another not!)   And some “maybe this will make things simpler” use cases:   its a solid “Plan B” for the Match/Miss dance. Fibers has me   sufficiently freaked out.   this might make server rendering 404s simpler? not sure about that yet   but definitely the top level patterns.   It might be an AMAZING way to migrate from v3 to v4, check this out, I   think will work.   ```jsx        (            )}/>  ``` Could even wrap all that junk up into <Route> components 🤔😯",0

Since there’s no way to distinguish if they want the function to be used with createElement v. being called directly, we need two different props to identify developer intent, and prevent React from unmounting the nodes.",0

We get a few benefits from this:   Routes may now be created programmatically, as well as via JSX.    This is useful in situations where it is desirable to assemble    the route configuration using separate modules, instead of all    at once. For example, in ApplicationRoute.js you could have: module.exports = Router.createRoute();   and in UserProfileRoute.js: var ApplicationRoute = require('./ApplicationRoute');  module.exports = Router.createRoute({   parentRoute: ApplicationRoute,   path: 'users/:id' });     may reference a Route object directly.    Route names may be re-used at different levels of the hierarchy.    For example, you could have two different routes named ""new"" but    nested inside different parent routes.           Using this route configuration, you could  or     depending on which one you wanted. A side    effect of this is that names of nested routes are no longer ""global"",    so e.g.  won't work because it is ambiguous, but     will still work.",0

This, however, made it hard to implement arguably the most common use case: resetting scroll when params change and preserving it when only query changes. This commit completely disables scroll updates when only query has changed. This provides a reasonable default behavior and leaves ignoreScrollBehavior for more complicated cases. If you'd rather keep the old behavior and reset scroll on query changes, you can either promote query variables to be route params or reset scroll position yourself in response to query changes in route handler's componentDidUpdate.

A ""router"" is now a ReactElement class instead of its own constructor. This architecture makes it easier for a router to share state with its instance and should eliminate the need for the flipSwitch() hack by using componentWillReceiveProps to swap out the state instead. Also, I added back the navigation methods at the router class level for other code that needs to use them. This commit also removes a lot of the old dead code. Most of the tests are still commented out, hence this is a wip.",0
