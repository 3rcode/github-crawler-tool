It's no longer maintained and has a number of fundamental problems (particularly around time travel). Integrating Redux and the DOM History API is challenging because they don't maintain the same semantics and the resulting integration is error prone. Getting to the router context will be easier in future versions of React Router, so the main motivations for needing it will be going away. So, while I would advise against trying to integrate the two, for those that still want this functionality can turn to libraries like @supasate's connected-react-router.",,0

Getting to the router context will be easier in future versions of React Router, so the main motivations for needing it will be going away.

This updated version is easier to read and makes more sense semantically because it is changing the emphasize of the sentence. With the previous sentence structure, the activity of the link is being made predominant; this is redundant imo since the basic action of what a link does is implicit in the context. In other words, everyone knows what a link does - there is no reason to highlight this in the sentence structure.  The new sentence structure instead highlights the link location as the predominant object of this sentence rather than the action of the link. Highlighting the location rather than action of the sentence is more fitting given that the context of what this method does (i.e. accepts a location to match).

When automatic path resolving is added, matchPath will need access to the parent match, so we will need to pass that argument to matchPath eventually anyways. When a parent match is null, a match object with default values is returned by matchPath. This match object should not be relied upon for resolving paths, but it will allow a  that uses the component or render prop to render. Fixes #4695 Make the default match obvious Add some match docs about null match Pathless child routes inherit parent, even when null This is only an issue when you use .

Instead of subscribing to location changes and using forceUpdate inside every , we better follow React's model by using setState in  and letting changes trickle down to descendants using React's built-in state propagation mechanism. This also means that we don't mutate context.router anymore (no more Object.assign). Instead, context.router was split into two parts: context.history and context.route (the  props + match). This allows us to leave context.history untouched and change context.route only according to the props + match state of each . withRouter was also updated to provide everything in a ""router"" prop instead of spreading all props to the component.",1

Let’s hope it doesn’t get abused 🙏🏼 Some notes: Theoretically, with this change we could ditch the entire subscription model. We could have the top level Router subscribe to history and setState, providing location on context. Then Routes would get updates naturally and access location from context. The problem is that shouldComponentUpdate will block deep updates to Routes. This is why we introduced subscriptions in the first place. With a location prop, however, apps could pass the location in to Routes that are behind a sCU. For example, in Redux, you would have location in your store, and then make a ConnectedRoute that gets the location from there instead of context. But that’s for a different day. The React team tells us “accessing data on context is unreliable, please use subscriptions” and so we do, which unfortunately opts us completely out of the setState update model, which is why this location prop is necessary to opt-back into it for animations. fixes #4351",1

Fibers has me   sufficiently freaked out. this might make server rendering 404s simpler? not sure about that yet   but definitely the top level patterns.

We get a few benefits from this: Routes may now be created programmatically, as well as via JSX.    This is useful in situations where it is desirable to assemble    the route configuration using separate modules, instead of all    at once. For example, in ApplicationRoute.js you could have: module.exports = Router.createRoute(); and in UserProfileRoute.js: var ApplicationRoute = require('./ApplicationRoute'); module.exports = Router.createRoute({   parentRoute: ApplicationRoute,   path: 'users/:id' }); may reference a Route object directly. Route names may be re-used at different levels of the hierarchy.    For example, you could have two different routes named ""new"" but    nested inside different parent routes. Using this route configuration, you could  or     depending on which one you wanted. A side    effect of this is that names of nested routes are no longer ""global"",    so e.g.  won't work because it is ambiguous, but     will still work.",1

5176,Use when instead of es6-promise,0.5204116,Minor: Move ES module build back to es6/ to avoid breaking people who were incorrectly importing from react-router/es6 (#3334),"Previously, the only way to opt out of scroll updates for a route would be by using ignoreScrollBehavior. This, however, made it hard to implement arguably the most common use case: resetting scroll when params change and preserving it when only query changes. This commit completely disables scroll updates when only query has changed. This provides a reasonable default behavior and leaves ignoreScrollBehavior for more complicated cases. If you'd rather keep the old behavior and reset scroll on query changes, you can either promote query variables to be route params or reset scroll position yourself in response to query changes in route handler's componentDidUpdate.
