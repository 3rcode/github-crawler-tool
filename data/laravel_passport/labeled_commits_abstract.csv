Minor documentation tweak to UPGRADE.md (#1526),0.43215367,Replace deprecated package and namespaces (#1158),"Update UPGRADE.md I just went through the steps of upgrading passport from v8 to v10 and hit a minor snag that could have been solved by a tweak to the documentation. When upgrading from v8 to v9 it says place two Passport static calls ""within the boot method of your AppServiceProvider"" When upgrading from v9 to v10 it says you can remove the calls from your AuthServiceProvider. I don't claim to know where those calls belonged in the first place, so this proposal just updates the documentation to list them both.

Allow multiple redirects when creating clients,0.95781934,Allow multiple redirects when creating clients (#928),"This change allows for multiple redirects in a comma separated list when adding them through the ClientController.

I took the approach of a custom validation rule because it seemed the most flexible in terms of implementing the custom logic. It allows for re-using Laravel's url validation rule. Fixes link",1

Add the ability to retrieve current client,0.9347793,Add the ability to retrieve current client (#854),"This commit adds the ability to retrieve the current client from the request, just like the current user is retrieved. I chose to do this in the TokenGuard class since this class uses the same logic to retrieve the current active user. Usage could be as follows: $client = $tokenGuard->client($request); One of the biggest reasons for adding this is that there isn't any way at the moment to retrieve the current client from the request. By adding this, users can use the client to further perform authorization actions or check the creator of the client and subsequently limit resources bases on either one of those two. This is especially helpful for client credentials grant requests where you simply don't have an active user. This way you can still limit resources if you want based on either the client or its creator. This commit is fully BC. No methods have been renamed, only added. The ones that have been modified still behave in the same way as before but only have some parts extracted to other methods so their code could be re-used. This solves the following long outstanding issue: link",1
