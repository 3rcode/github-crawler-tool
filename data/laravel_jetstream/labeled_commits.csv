259,Priorize 'accepted' validation rule for terms checkbox (#980),1.0,Priorize 'accepted' validation rule for terms checkbox (#980)," Better handle sitatuations where a user's role on a team is undefined  In some situations (especially when testing using database factories), the ""role"" column on the team_user table may be left NULL. As a result, attempting to check the user's permissions based on their role causes an error, as Jetstream::findRole() requires a string. For example: ```php use App\Models\Team; use App\Models\User; $team = Team::factory()     ->with(User::factory())     ->create(); $team->users->first()->hasTeamPermission($team, 'read'); ``` This commit ensures that Jetstream::findRole() is only called if we have a corresponding role, preventing this error. Similarly, teamPermissions() will no longer cause a ""ErrorException: Attempt to read property ""permissions"" on null"" exception when the role is undefined.  Be more explicit with the the autoload definitions to account for case-sensitive filesystems  Running locally on macOS, PHP can find Database\Factories\TeamFactory in database/factories/TeamFactory.php, but on case-sensitive systems (like Linux, used by the CI pipeline and hosts everywhere) PSR-4 becomes even more important.",1

676,Remove unnecessary classes (#735),0.7951405,Remove unnecessary CSS classes (#735), Update two-factor-authentication-form.blade.php  I had an issue where I couldn't scan the barcode when setting up 2FA. Determined the issue was using darkmode tailwind css styling. The Google authenticator app and VIP Access Authenticator don't pick up the barcode if it has a dark background right up against it. Add a p-4 white background resolved the issue on both apps. Propose adding this white border out of the box to prevent this issue if the user chooses a dark color adjacent to the barcode.
