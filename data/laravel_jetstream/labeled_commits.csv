(View: /var/www/html/vendor/livewire/livewire/src/views/mount-component.blade.php) I believe this is because the factory doesn't specify the attribute. I considered updating the factory to include it (set to null), but then I thought it might be a little messy because there should be a check to see if the feature's enabled. This solution, however, requires everyone to remember to get a fresh user instance, when needed, without it being clear as to why. So...let me know if I should try a different approach...",1

Better handle sitatuations where a user's role on a team is undefined (#905),0.96011543,Better handle situations where a user's role on a team is undefined (#905)," Better handle sitatuations where a user's role on a team is undefined  In some situations (especially when testing using database factories), the ""role"" column on the team_user table may be left NULL. As a result, attempting to check the user's permissions based on their role causes an error, as Jetstream::findRole() requires a string. For example: ```php use App\Models\Team; use App\Models\User; $team = Team::factory()     ->with(User::factory())     ->create(); $team->users->first()->hasTeamPermission($team, 'read'); ``` This commit ensures that Jetstream::findRole() is only called if we have a corresponding role, preventing this error. Similarly, teamPermissions() will no longer cause a ""ErrorException: Attempt to read property ""permissions"" on null"" exception when the role is undefined.  Be more explicit with the the autoload definitions to account for case-sensitive filesystems  Running locally on macOS, PHP can find Database\Factories\TeamFactory in database/factories/TeamFactory.php, but on case-sensitive systems (like Linux, used by the CI pipeline and hosts everywhere) PSR-4 becomes even more important.",1

Determined the issue was using darkmode tailwind css styling. The Google authenticator app and VIP Access Authenticator don't pick up the barcode if it has a dark background right up against it. Add a p-4 white background resolved the issue on both apps. Propose adding this white border out of the box to prevent this issue if the user chooses a dark color adjacent to the barcode.
