It might be the last release of the cycle, but this release comes packed with goodies, so here we'll try to unpack a bit of what's changed.
A Big Step Towards Modern Javascript Build Tooling Support
First, while all addons are still shipping as v1-addons, they now look a lot like v2-addons. We're referring to this as ""v1-lite"". We pre-build them with rollup leaving only the most minimal babel step to be done when included in your app. Generally this should result in applications seeing improved build times and vastly improved embroider support.
There are still a few blocking issues in ember-auto-import and embroider before EmberData will be able to flip the switch and ship its packages as v2-addons, but that's what is left at this point: a switch to flip.  Many thanks to @richgt for his efforts to help us on this journey.
Documentation
Numerous APIs associated with the Cache, Notifications, Identity Management, and Record Lifecycle have new or improved docs. All packages have had their package overviews updated (some extensively, a few just a bit -- for now), and all packages now have a detailed README.
Deprecation documentation is now written inline alongside the flags that may be used to control granular deprecation stripping. Deprecation documentation will also continue to be added to the deprecation guides, though as of yet the 4.x guides have not been added there (we'd love help with this!).
A major focus of the 5.x cycle will be on refining and polishing the documentation for Polaris. A Quest issue has been opened and we'd love your help!
@ember-data/request has its first Stable Release!
This package introduces the RequestManager, a package that can be used independently (but also comes bundled with ember-data) that re-envisions how data fetching is managed for both EmberData and applications more broadly.
You may want to peruse the RFC or head over and read its documentation
With this release, all existing request flows in EmberData utilize the RequestManager. While Adapters and Serializers will continue to work via the legacy-handler, these concepts are now entirely optional and users should expect that over the course of the 5.x series as the new request management story is further polished that these legacy concepts will be deprecated and removed from the recommended experience. They will, however, likely live on much longer since their implementation is now as an integration into the request-pipeline of the future and as such is something an application could choose to integrate and continue using.
The Notifications Service has Expanded Capabilities
In addition to subscribing to notifications for individual resources, the notification service now enables subscribing to resource added/removed events and Document added/removed events.
Promises are now Native Promises
EmberData now uses native promises for all promise APIs instead of RSVP Promises. This can have some unexpected timing affects, there's an overview here
The Cache 2.1 Spec is Implemented
What this means in effect is that store.request is now a much ... much more powerful API than store.query. Requests are capable of providing a cache-key or being cached by URL, with full lifecycle control and notification subscriptions. Documents are a first-class citizen of the Cache and EmberData more broadly, we are no longer just a resource-cache. For the full motivations and a discussion of all the various capabilities this unlocks we recommend reading the RFC
To go with this, the JSON:API cache previously provided by @ember-data/record-data is now upgraded to the 2.1 spec and available as the @ember-data/json-api package. While this cache does not yet implement the full suite of cache 2.1 APIs, support for all Cache 2.1 APIs has been added to the store.

9,"v4.7.1 (2022-09-06)
Version 4.7 includes a number of new deprecations, several new features, bug fixes, and a large slate of significant performance improvements.
Of Note:

Version 4.7 implements a ""2.1"" cache spec while deprecating the v1 cache spec. This spec differs somewhat from the original 2.0 RFC, an updated RFC specifying the modifications will be published soon. Users looking to migrate to the 2.1 cache should expect that the finalized version of 2.1 enforces that the cache is always a singleton (vs merely allowed to be a singleton), and that data provided to the store and queries to the store from the cache should always contain identifiers in their stable form.  This latter point is enforced in 4.7, the former is not yet enforced.
Explicit Polymorphic Relationships: starting in 4.7 it is no longer required to use Mixins or Inheritance to achieve polymorphic relationships. See emberjs/rfcs#793 for full details.
Most record hook and cache APIs now have documentation on api.emberjs.com. More still to come as part of finalizing v2.1 cache.
The return values of hasMany relationships, peekAll, findAll and query are now proxies to native arrays and as such all native array APIs are now usable. These objects will act fully as if they are native arrays. Restrictions on immutability of the result of peekAll and query still apply.
InternalModel is dead, long live InternalModel. Similarly, nearly all private API's have undergone significant change, if your app previously abused these APIs the most likely refactor is to use a custom model or a custom cache.

⚡️ Performance Improvements

Note: many performance improvements are gated by deprecation removal, meaning that you need to resolve all deprecations for EmberData 4.7 and mark your app as compatible with that version in order to opt in to the fastest codepaths.

All applications should observe significant speed improvements when using EmberData 4.7. The below call-outs are in relation to EmberData 4.6, which was itself also the fastest version of EmberData since we began benchmarking and tracking in the late 2.x series.  Many of these improvements were made possible due to the nearing completion of Project Trim (and specifically the removal of InternalModel).
⚡️Pushing new data into the cache is now ~33% faster
⚡️Accessing the LiveArray (peekAll / findAll) for the first time is now 97% faster
⚡️Creating record instances is now ~45-50% faster
⚡️Reduced memory pressure may speedup first render after a large push by ~75%
⚡️Initial Access of Related Records is now ~80% faster
⚡️Initial Access of Async Relationships sees 30% faster  creation of async proxies
⚡️Unloading of all records individually (one at a time in a loop) is 40% faster
⚡️Destroying all records (e.g. also sending an API request) in a loop  is 62% faster
⚡️Unloading all records (of all types) is ~98% faster
⚡️Receiving and processing updated payloads for existing hasMany relationships is ~40% faster
In addition to these improvements significantly speeding up data usage in applications, we expect to see especially dramatic improvements anywhere the application undergoes teardown (after each test in CI or Fastboot request is processed). In several applications that we looked at, fixture population for acceptance and integration tests accounted for 30% of the total test time, with teardown of those fixtures representing another 40% of the total test time. We would expect such tests to see an overall test-run improvement time in the 50-75% range.

","v4.7.1 (2022-09-06)
Version 4.7 includes a number of new deprecations, several new features, bug fixes, and a large slate of significant performance improvements.
Of Note:
Version 4.7 implements a ""2.1"" cache spec while deprecating the v1 cache spec. This spec differs somewhat from the original 2.0 RFC, an updated RFC specifying the modifications will be published soon. Users looking to migrate to the 2.1 cache should expect that the finalized version of 2.1 enforces that the cache is always a singleton (vs merely allowed to be a singleton), and that data provided to the store and queries to the store from the cache should always contain identifiers in their stable form.  This latter point is enforced in 4.7, the former is not yet enforced.
Explicit Polymorphic Relationships: starting in 4.7 it is no longer required to use Mixins or Inheritance to achieve polymorphic relationships. See emberjs/rfcs#793 for full details.
Most record hook and cache APIs now have documentation on api.emberjs.com. More still to come as part of finalizing v2.1 cache.
The return values of hasMany relationships, peekAll, findAll and query are now proxies to native arrays and as such all native array APIs are now usable. These objects will act fully as if they are native arrays. Restrictions on immutability of the result of peekAll and query still apply.
InternalModel is dead, long live InternalModel. Similarly, nearly all private API's have undergone significant change, if your app previously abused these APIs the most likely refactor is to use a custom model or a custom cache.
⚡️ Performance Improvements
Note: many performance improvements are gated by deprecation removal, meaning that you need to resolve all deprecations for EmberData 4.7 and mark your app as compatible with that version in order to opt in to the fastest codepaths.
All applications should observe significant speed improvements when using EmberData 4.7. The below call-outs are in relation to EmberData 4.6, which was itself also the fastest version of EmberData since we began benchmarking and tracking in the late 2.x series.  Many of these improvements were made possible due to the nearing completion of Project Trim (and specifically the removal of InternalModel).
⚡️Pushing new data into the cache is now ~33% faster
⚡️Accessing the LiveArray (peekAll / findAll) for the first time is now 97% faster
⚡️Creating record instances is now ~45-50% faster
⚡️Reduced memory pressure may speedup first render after a large push by ~75%
⚡️Initial Access of Related Records is now ~80% faster
⚡️Initial Access of Async Relationships sees 30% faster  creation of async proxies
⚡️Unloading of all records individually (one at a time in a loop) is 40% faster
⚡️Destroying all records (e.g. also sending an API request) in a loop  is 62% faster
⚡️Unloading all records (of all types) is ~98% faster
⚡️Receiving and processing updated payloads for existing hasMany relationships is ~40% faster
In addition to these improvements significantly speeding up data usage in applications, we expect to see especially dramatic improvements anywhere the application undergoes teardown (after each test in CI or Fastboot request is processed). In several applications that we looked at, fixture population for acceptance and integration tests accounted for 30% of the total test time, with teardown of those fixtures representing another 40% of the total test time. We would expect such tests to see an overall test-run improvement time in the 50-75% range.

11,"v4.5.0 (2022-07-27)
Version 4.5 includes a number of new deprecations, a significant internal refactoring of the store architecture and several bug fixes.
Of note:


Users of just the core of EmberData may expect their builds to be 35-50% smaller. This is due to most of the legacy support for @ember-data/model having now found its final location at home in that package instead of within the @ember-data/store package. The size of @ember-data/store is reduced from ~16kb compressed to ~9.5kb compressed, potentially a little less depending on what deprecations are resolved and what other packages are present. We expect the core to continue to shrink as we complete the final stages of removing InternalModel, complete implementations for recently accepted deprecation RFCs, and introduce RecordDataV2.


Users of private store APIs may find these APIs have now been deprecated or removed. Internal restructuring will be high the next 6 months as we polish off the removal of InternalModel and continue to simplify codepaths which that removal allows us to do. All but a very few private methods have been entirely eliminated from the store.


New Deprecations target 5.0 and include:

deprecating some internal usage of RSVP.Promise that applications may have become dependent on if their tests are leaky
deprecating the type property on snapshots (which would lookup the model class).
deprecating store.find, a private method that has been maintained in case users accidentally fell into using ember's hidden autofetch behavior in routes
deprecating store.hasRecordForId, as peekRecord is generally more useful and provides the same information (and more).
deprecating store.recordWasInvalid, an unused internal api that ember-model-validations appears to be using.
deprecating passing strings to the schema lookup functions attributesDefinitionFor and relationshipsDefinitionFor, these APIs now expect an object with at least a type property representing the model name.
deprecating the -json-api fallback adapter, a hidden behavior that provided an adapter if the application failed to define one.

As always deprecated code can be eliminated from the build output by specifying the compatWith arg on the emberData configuration in your app.

Breaking Changes
Usaved deleted records are no longer removed from hasMany relationships and RecordArrays returned by the store
In Ember Data 1.13 once a record was marked as deleted it was removed from all of the RecordArrays and hasMany arrays it belongTo. This made it difficult to create UIs where a user could flag a record for deletion but still allow the user the ability to un-flag the record until the save request was made.
In Ember Data 2.0 a record will no longer be removed from hasMany relationships or RecordArrays until the delete has been acknowledged by the adapter. Although deleted records will be visible in hasMany relationships they will not be serialized when saving these relationships to the backend.
