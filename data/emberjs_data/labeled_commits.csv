Having this available provides a number of benefits to security tooling. For example, it allows for greater trust by checking for signed commits, contributors to a release and validating history with the project. It also allows for comparison between the source code and the published artifact in order to detect attacks on authors during the publication process. We validate that we're making a PR against the correct repository by comparing the metadata for the published artifact on npmjs.com against the metadata in the package.json file in the repository. This change is provided by a team at Microsoft -- we're happy to answer any questions you may have. (Members of this team include @s-tuli, @iarna, @v-rr, @v-jiepeng, @v-zhzhou and @v-gjy). If you would prefer that we not make these sorts of PRs to projects you maintain, please just say. If you'd like to learn more about what we're doing here, we've prepared a document talking about both this project and some of our other activities around supply chain security here: microsoft/Secure-Supply-Chain This PR provides repository metadata for the following packages: * @ember-data/canary-features * @ember-data/private-build-infra * adapter-encapsulation-test-app * debug-encapsulation-test-app * eslint-plugin-ember-data * fastboot-test-app * model-encapsulation-test-app * record-data-encapsulation-test-app * relationship-performance-test-app * serializer-encapsulation-test-app * @ember-data/unpublished-test-infra Co-authored-by: msftenanceprovenance msftenanceprovenance@microsoft.com Co-authored-by: Scott Newcomer snewcomer24@gmail.com",1

1044,Merge pull request #2336 from sly7-7/one-to-none-can-reset-value,0.5699983,#5377 invalidate link promise on inverse unload,"We recently made some changes to the way arrays get consumed when autotracking in Ember - specifically, whenever an array is return from Ember.get, @computed, or @tracked, we track that array for changes in the future. Previously, we also tracked it if it was an EmberArray. This check was a bit redundant, and costly, so we removed it and now only do it for native arrays. The reason this is generally safe is that non-native EmberArrays usually have a contract - you must access the state of the array via objectAt, and you must update via pushObject, popObject, etc. The array is consumed when using objectAt, so theres no need to do it eagerly in Ember.get (and penalize all other object access). The Errors class is a bit of a special case, because it adds additonal capabilities - the errorsFor method, which returns a subset of errors in the array. This info is accessed via the errorsFor() method, which does not consume the array proxy at all. So, previously, if a user did something like: js model.errors.errorsFor(field).map(error => error.message); When model.errors was accessed, it was a @computed property, and it consumed the entire array proxy. Later on, when the user goes to add an error, it adds the error to the main array and the subarray returned by errorsFor(), and dirties both, so the user's code is called again and updates properly. With the recent changes, that doesn't happen anymore. Since errorsFor returns a native array (with prototype extensions enabled), map does not use objectAt internally either. So, there is nothing that is properly consuming the array. This PR adds the consumption manually. In the future, we can likely add a primitive that allows Errors to create and manually manage tags, or it can use something along the lines of a TrackedArray for these errors instead.",0

Enable no-empty-pattern rule for TypeScript files  Fixes two no-empty-pattern errors by disabling the rule for the violating lines. I think this is actually a case where we're seeing false positives because the rule was originally not implemented with TypeScript in mind, so eslint is interpreting the type definition as an attempt to destructure. This needs at least an issue open in this repo but probably with @typescript-eslint as well.  Enable no-console rule for TypeScript files  Enable no-console rule for TypeScript files and ""fixes"" an existing error by telling eslint to ignore the line.

Enable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars rule for TypeScript files  Enables the @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars rule for TypeScript files and fixes the errors.

I think we should continue running Travis CI alongside this for a little while to make sure everything is working correctly but we should remove the Azure Pipelines config. Why?  This GitHub version runs much faster because we're given more   resources to run jobs concurrently. The syntax is also nicer, which is my opinion of course but it seems   to be shared by others.  Stages The jobs are configured to run in three stages, each only running once all of the jobs in the previous stage have passed:  lint & basic-tests floating-dependencies, lts, releases, additional-scenarios external-partners  This setup is intended to make sure that one build is not using all of the repo's allowed jobs. It is a trade off between speed and resource availability that we might want to tweak in the future. Allowed failures GitHub actions, like Azure Pipelines, doesn't provide a feature like Travis CI's allow_failures, which allows a job to fail without failing the entire build.  As a workaround, this uses the continue-on-error feature to allow some external partner tests to fail without failing the entire build. The downside is that it is difficult to know when these jobs are actually failing since they appear to have passed in GitHub's UI. We will likely want to do something to address this in the future. Downsides   GitHub Actions Workflows are still in beta so it's possible that there could be breaking changes.   Ensure tags start a CI job. (#6475)   Without this change, all pushed tags will not do a CI build (because there must be at least one positive match if any filtering is done).",1

There was a discussion on the PR that suggested adding an additional check to make sure that that the deprecations were only triggered for instances of Ember Data's Model class https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/6059#discussion_r284921979 This extra check was added but it accidentally was checking for this to be an instance of the Model class, but that can never be true since this will always be an instance of InternalModel: https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/5e495394cbf67025be2622f604e67004d79bc21c/packages/store/addon/-private/system/model/internal-model.ts#L446-L455 Since we only want to check for these deprecations for instances of Model, I moved the deprecation logic to the Model class https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/6059 also included a mechanism for tracking deprecations that were logged per model class so we could prevent logging multiple deprecations for the same model class and deprecated lifecycle method pair: https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/5e495394cbf67025be2622f604e67004d79bc21c/packages/store/addon/-private/system/model/internal-model.ts#L61-L77 This also fixes a bug with the deprecation tracking logic which was that we were never actually adding the logged deprecations to the WeakMap meant to keep track of them.",0

1810,Bump eslint-config-prettier from 8.2.0 to 8.3.0 (#7487),0.6088072,#3753 Bumped the ember-inflector version to 1.9.2.,"From https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/6166 This refactors some tests so that they don't rely on the createStore test helper. createStore was helpful in the past but is less so now that we have nice APIs for dependency injection.  One test was removed from unit/store/adapter-interop - Store working with a Adapter because I don't think it was correct. Here was the test: https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/39182f324d5777e4a75c4a582f0791631e37d8de/packages/-ember-data/tests/unit/store/adapter-interop-test.js#L28-L32 This test was, at one time, testing that it was possible to pass a factory as the adapter property to Store. This feature was removed in https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/3191 but the test continued passing because of the way the createStore works. https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/39182f324d5777e4a75c4a582f0791631e37d8de/packages/-ember-data/tests/helpers/store.js#L57-L60",0

This helps to bring the Azure pipeline config closer to feature pairity with the config for Travis CI. I took a slightly different approach here by whitelisting the master and beta branches rather than trying to blacklist the many other cases where we want to skip the linting because this is easier to express using the syntax for expressions available in Azure.

2021,Merge pull request #2810 from omarismail/improve_error_msg_belongs_to,0.5356517,#8399 fix: deprecated record-array rejectBy use optional value if supplied (@mrloop),"This change removes ember-fetch as a direct dependency of ember-data, and allows for this dependency to be provided by the host application or for users to directly use native fetch. Having ember-fetch as a direct dependency of ember-data has proven troublesome. There are issues using ember-fetch as a nested dependency (these are documented in the ember-fetch README), but it is also quite difficult for ember-data to ensure that the versions of ember-fetch provided will actually include the correct version (duplicated addon merging in the ember-cli addon space is complicated and error prone). This change moves the determineBodyPromise and serializeQueryParams helper functions directly into @ember-data/adapter. A future version of ember-fetch will drop these utilities (as well as the ember-data adapter mixin). In addition, this also enables usage of the global fetch if a fetch module is not provided.",0

Our script separates out these steps so that we can recover from publishing errors more gracefully, and surfaces the OTP prompt (and reprompt) at the correct point in time for the publish. The opportunity was taken here to add guard rails around many of the finer points of our release process. Outside of branching that occurs at the beginning of the release cycle and changelog updates our release process is not mostly automated.",1

This commit migrates the instrument flag handling to a single file (lib/heimdall-utils.js) and uses that single exported function throughout the rest of the code. It also removes the reliance on process.env string coercion (which apparently can be broken when you've reassigned process.env). It also changes around the details of the previous --record-data-rfc-build flag. Instead, we add a --disable-record-data-rfc-build flag (because as of 3.5 beta's the record data code is enabled by default). During this refactor, the config hook was migrated into the dummy app itself, so that ember-data no longer adds that flag to all consuming app's runtime config.",1

2386,[CHORE] introduce static ModelSchema interface (#6764),0.6549709,#5117 Give Model a static toString method,"In my experimentation, I've discovered that though the promise returned from store.query() does have array-like methods on it, the actual AdapterPopulatedRecordArray is what the promise resolves to. For example, the length property of the object returned from store.query will always be 0. The object which the promise resolves to will represent the actual length of the records that were queried. The documentation for store.query states plainly that the AdapterPopulatedRecordArray is the resolution of the promise, but the documentation here misrepresented that. For example, the original code actually would behave like this: ```javascript   // GET /users?isAdmin=true   var admins = store.query('user', { isAdmin: true }); admins.then(function() {     console.log(admins.get(""length"")); // Throws: ""admins.get"" is not a function   }); ```",0

This baseDir is used to traverse all JS files in all deps (recursively) and ensure that if any of them are changed, the transpilation cache is invalidated. Once we swapped to using ember-source as an npm package this meant that we would be stating/hashing all files inside of node_modules/ember-source/**. When using npm link ember-source this leads to a JS max heap errors (because of node_modules/ember-source/tmp/** being MASSIVE).

Unfortunately, this code was factored in a way that relied on mutating internal private state of the underlying Ember.ComputedProperty instance when Ember.testing was true (which was used as a way to determine prod vs non-prod). When this code was introduced (2014-12-02), setting _cacheable on a ComputedProperty instance would have worked as intended, however a refactor in Ember (ironically one day prior, but on Ember's canary channel) deprecated using _cacheable or .cacheable() (in favor of opting out of caching via .volatile()). Since this has not worked since Ember 2.0.0, and it has not been an issue, this commit completely removes the manual caching / volatile swapping between prod/dev/testing environments.",0

Supporting both mocha test blueprints indefinitely is untenable, and now seems like as good a time as any to drop the blueprints for the older syntax.

Even though we had a config/ember-try.js with many scenarios, none of them properly removed the ember-source version (even though ba7f46221 was specifically trying to do this :sob:). The fundamental issue here is:  ember-try supports removing packages, but requires that you specify them   in the dependencies or devDependencies objects.  Since my changes in   ba7f46221 added ""ember-source"": null to the root of the npm config   it was completely ignored :disappointed:. ember-source emits a warning to the console when it is present and   the bower package for ember is in use.  Unfortunately, this warning is   a bit misleading (it doesn't tell you that the ember-source from npm   will always win). The ember-source addon should be updated to throw an   error when this misconfiguration is detected. ember-cli will always use ember-source if it is present, and   completely ignore whatever is in bower.json. IMHO, this default was not   correct and ember-cli should have done the same thing that ember-data   did during its migration from bower to npm: if both packages are present   default to bower.json version with a warning.",1

There are several issues with the current code base:   in general, if the serializer returns an array for the primary data   returned by normalizeQueryRecordResponse, then store.queryRecord   resolves with an array   if rest serializer is used and an array is returned by the adapter,   then the first entry of the array is used as primary data and   store.queryRecord resolves with the first record   if json-api serializer is used and the primary data is an array, then   store.queryRecord resolves with an array of the primary records   the API documentation for queryRecord is similar to query and   doesn't indicate when this method should be used in contrast to   store.query and getting the first record of the array   an assertion for the payload returned by the adapter for queryRecord   not being an empty object has been added in 2.4, which is a regression   to the behavior of 2.3    This commit addresses the above issues and makes the following changes:   add assertion that store.queryRecord never resolves with an array   add deprecation warning for the rest-serializers' queryRecord, if an   array is returned instead of a single record   removes the assertion that the returned payload from the adapter for   queryRecord is not an empty object   add assertion within json-api serializer that the primary data of the   normalized response is not an array ",1

3660,chore(deps-dev): bump ember-source from 4.0.1 to 4.2.0 (#7892),0.70036435,#5197 Fix ember-data Node 4.x builds,"The modelNameFromPayloadKey and payloadKeyFromModelName hooks on the serializer allow to customize the mapping between the key of a JSON and the corresponding name of the model. Consider the following payload: json {   ""blog/post"": {     ""id"": 1   } } To map the ""blog/post"" key to the post model, the modelNameFromPayloadKey hook is used: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""blog/post"")  There are some issues with the current code base, as the modelNameFromPayloadKey and payloadKeyFromModelName hooks are also used to map the ""value"" of a type from / to the payload. Consider the following payload of a JSON-API document: json {   ""data"": {     ""id"": 1,     ""type"": ""API:V1::User""   } } To map the namespaced type to the model name ember-data is using, currently the modelNameFromPayloadKey is used: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""API::V1::User"") Now this gets complicated if your API responds with the following payload (using custom key and custom types for polymorphic records for example): json {   ""blog/post"": {     ""id"": 1,     ""user"": 2,     ""userType"": ""API:V1::Administrator""   } } Now the modelNameFromPayloadKey is invoked for both: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""blog/post"") serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""API::V1::Administrator"") This means that the logic within the hook would get complicated.  As the name suggests, the method should only be used to map the key, not the value. This commit adds modelNameFromPayloadType and payloadTypeFromModelName hooks and uses them during normalization and serialization. This commit maintains the old behavior using, if it is used and logs a deprecation warning to move to the new hooks.",1

This feature adds new public methods to DS.RESTAdapter, which allow to customize the properties of a request:  methodForRequest to get the HTTP verb urlForRequest to get the URL headersForRequest to get the headers dataForRequest to get the data (query params or request body)  The params hash passed to those methods has all the properties with which the corresponding find, createRecord, findQuery, ...  call have been invoked: store, type, snapshot(s), id(s) and query. The requestType property indicates which method is requested; the possible values are:  createRecord updateRecord deleteRecord query queryRecord findRecord findAll findMany findHasMany findBelongsTo  Performing the actual AJAX request is handled by the _makeRequest method, which is similar to the existing ajax method: it makes the request using jQuery.ajax and attaches success and failure handlers.  Say your API handles creation of resources via PUT, this can now be customized as follows: ``` js // adapters/application.js import DS from 'ember-data'; export DS.RESTAdapter.extend({   methodForRequest: function(params) {     if (params.requestType === 'createRecord') {       return ""PUT"";     } return this._super(...arguments);  } }); ```",0

3824,[fix] Add json:api header on every requests,0.68760544,#3550 Fix JSONSerializer to pass through payload.included,"Taking as example this scenario: ```js User = DS.Model.extend({   name:    DS.attr('string'),   pets: DS.hasMany('pet', { polymorphic: true }) }); Pet = DS.Model.extend({   name: DS.attr('string'), }); Cat = Pet.extend({   // ... }); Parrot = Pet.extend({   // ... }); ``` As of today, when using the DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin in a serializer and configuring the serialization stategy like this: attrs: {   pets: { serialize: 'ids' } } The relationship is serialized: json     {       ""user"": {         ""id"": ""1""         ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",         ""pets"": [1,2]       }     } This works ok if the polymorphism is based on STI, but that is just one specific implementation does not cover all use cases. Probably when a hasMany relationship is polymorphic the serialization should generate an array of object containing id and type by default, but at this point this can't be changed because it would break apps in the wild. Because of that a new serialization strategy named ids-and-types has been created that covers this use case. Probably this should become the default behavior of the ids strategy in ember 3.0, but not for now. For the same example above, this stragegy would generate the following payload: ```js {   ""user"": {     ""id"": ""1""     ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",     ""pets"": [       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Cat"" },       { ""id"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Parrot""}     ]   } } ```  Note that with this strategy if the differenty type of records don't whare the same ids space, that is not a problem. ```js {   ""user"": {     ""id"": ""1""     ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",     ""pets"": [       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Cat"" },       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Parrot""} // Same id, but different type     ]   } } ```",0

This moves a large portion of code out of the store and instead uses delegation. There's also a performance benefit: If you look up adapter:post and fallback to adapter:application, this lookup is cached. So, if you look up adapter:post again, that instance will actually be cached. Previously, we did the lookup for adapter:post every time. This also removes passing factories as the adapter property to DS.Store. closes #3050",0

This class is a fast Javascript object that contains all the data that we know for a particular record. At the ED/App code boundaries, such as responses to find, models being set/pushed to belongsTo/hasMany we convert between internalModels and DS.Models. This should be a huge performance win, because we now lazily create DS.Models which are pretty slow to instantiate. We need to wait for the new serializer/push refactor in order to use a push that does not immediately materialize a record to get further perf gains. For now most of perf gains if for foreign keys.",0

5262,Merge pull request #5009 from bekzod/cleanup-index,0.60919017,#5009 cleanup index.js and drop 0.12 node,"When developing APIs, is pretty common to place a high level caching mechanism, like Varnish, to cache requests to public API endpoints, and those tools use the URL string to determine if they have a cached response. As an example, if one user requests /posts?sort=price&category=pets and another requests /posts?category=pets&sort=price, the cached request won't be used in the second call. Varnish by example has some modules to sort query parameters when caching, but it's not the default behavior and requires custom config. Although the URL specification does not say that the order of the query parameters is meaningless, in the bast mayority (read: all) of the APIs I've seen, 2 requests are considered identical regardless of the the order. Because of that, sorting the query params consistenlty is considered a good practice, so this PR introduces a sortQueryParams key in the RESTAdapter class, that defaults to a function to sort query params alphabetically. In case you don't want this behavior, setting that property to a falsey value in the ApplicationAdapter will respect the original order. In case you want a different order, you can pass a function that does the sorting your way. As other customization in ED, this can be customized on a per resource level, in case the order matters in only a few endpoints.",0

It separates the path through which server side and client side updates happen, which lays the ground work for tracking relationship changes. 2. When pushing records into the store, it splits the push process into three phases using a custom runloop: a) Push primary key data and attribtues b) Turn foreign keys into records c) Update relationships The runloop changes have the effect of making pushing relationships at least 50% faster, more if you have more relationships.

This will enable fixing of bugs such as #651, by segmenting on the number of records Allows users to preset attributes and relationships on a model when doing a find call. For relationships you can either pass in a record or an id Gives rudimentary support for nested urls, by passing in the record object to the buildUrl method Removes the owner being passed to findMany becuase it can be looked up on the original record Adds couple special cased SSOT features that were needed for buildUrl/removal of owner property to be viable  This PR lays the groundwork for: 1.

CPs hang around though, and as a result that data on the meta becomes a cache. For some details about a relationship, this is fine. If User has many Posts, and you use User via a container, it would cache a reference to the Post factory. But if you then destroy that container, the reference to Post still exists in the CP meta. Furthermore, if you create a new container and use User and Post via that new container, the cache factory value for Post will be that of the old container and not the new container. This only is a problem if you expect to have Post be a different factory in each container. In ember-cli, MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS are enabled. This means all factories are extended before being returned by the container. So every time you have a new container, you have a new factory (though it looks and behaves the same). This change gets rid of that cache on meta. Instead it creates a function that accepts the store and meta, and returns the relationship object expected throughout Ember-Data. Two alternatives were considered:  Always check against typeKey instead of instanceof, but this felt like a dodge of the real problem and would leave the issue for others to find, or Create a new first-class relationship object, but this would be a far more invasive change, and would impact much of the codebase that the current relationship object has already leaked through.  Additionally, the types were being cached on model class-level CPs. For this patch, those have simply been marked cacheable(false). A later patch should refactor the CPs out of the way, or at least re-write their consumers to expect a relationship object without the factory itself already fetched.",0

It claims to be passed the model type when called, but in often does not receive this argument (null is passed instead). This only serves to confuse the use-case for normalizePayload, and encourage its use when overriding an extraction helper is actually the right choice. This tradeoff, dropping the argument of type in all cases, means normalizePayload can still be run over data added with pushPayload. pushPayload knows nothing of which model is being pushed, and thus cannot provide the type reliably.",0
6011,Merge pull request #217 from bradleypriest/patch-1,0.57237065,#3771 update coalesceFindRequests doc for JSONAPIAdapter,"typeKeys must have a strong formatting convention, since they are used for comparison in several spots of the code. Prior to this commit:  The container's normalized version of the factory name was set to     the typeKey. This leaked the container concerns about name     formatting up to Ember-Data, and to the user's interaction with     API calls like find('some-module') The typeKey property of a model class was allowed to pass into the     code without normalization.  In general, for a developer to know which to pick of find('some-car'), find('someCar') or find('some_cars') they had to understand which resolver their container was using. This demonstrates a bad coupling, and makes documenting Ember-Data exceedingly hard (we should not need to mention a caveat about picking a resolver). This commit normalizes typeKeys to always be camelCase, both those returned by typeForRoot (for which the documentation has been improved) and for those set on factories by modelFor. From here on, find('someCar') should be considered the standard format for multi-word model names.",0

This change also allows specifying a custom store when using non-global resolver (i.e. EAK/ember-cli). Previously, we were only looking for a property Store hung off of the application instance. Now you can have a module named (in the case of stock EAK setup): app/stores/application or app/application/store.js (pods structure). A deprecation warning was added, and the prior technique still works so this is not a breaking change (although I believe that we should remove before the prior lookup prior to 1.0).",0

The resolver will normalize the fullpath of the es6 module and calls Ember.String.dashserize on the fullpath. This converts the underscores to dashes, for example: -ams instead of _ams so the lookup becomes app/serializers/-ams and this of course cannot be found. This PR removes what can be argued as an unnecessary attempt to protect the adapter and serializer names from being overwritten, instead the convention to be pushed should be to have the names match the adpter/serializer class name. In addition, the ActiveModelAdapter's name was strangely called _ams and this does't match the class name at all. There is no 's' in the class name at all. Instead this PR has opted to rename both the adapter and the serializer active-model.",0

6425,Release v4.12.0-alpha.8,0.87619483,"Release 2.4.0-beta.1 (January 12, 2016)",Updates to the latest ember-dev which ensures that the git config user.name and git config user.email values are present before calling git cherry-pick. This is due to a recent change in git 1.8.5 which requires the user information be present prior to a cherry-pick. Travis accidentally reverted to using an older git version that does not support the --points-at flag that we are using in ember-dev. This forces the system to upgrade to the latest version.

In production, it is possible that a root key in an API response changes in a way that your serializer's typeForRoot implementation does not convert properly. Since the assert in modelFor is stripped in production builds, the javascript error raised in a production environment would be: ""Cannot set property 'typeKey' on undefined"" This commit changes the assert to a check and throw so the error raised would be something like: ""No model was found for 'home_planet'"" The provides a much more helpful error for real-world production errors at a relatively small price (one extra line of code and a simple value check).",0

(Simply set ENV['BUILD_TYPE']='canary') Add ember:generate_static_test_site task to create a static HTML   file for running the test suite. Add custom test results gathering for use in cross-browser testing. Make sure that the test file being used in the Assetfile is prefixed   with the proper dasherized project name (prior to this Ember Data   tests were still named ember-tests.js and now they will be   ember-data-tests.js). Fixes issue where local rake test runs would attempt to perform git   operations (checkout and cherry-pick). Now git operations will   only be attempted if ENV['CI']=true.

Documentation generator via rake docs task. Automatic publishing of generated docs for each build. Will wait for the Rack server to be ready for connections before   initiating tests (hopefully mitigates the phantomjs timeout issue) Will test each package both with and without feature flags. Will abort tests if defeatureify is not present and a   features.json file exists. Updates to QUnit 1.12.0. Updates to use Puma for automated tests. Many test improvements.  The updated QUnit runner fixes the issue with ember-data causing the moduleDone output (totals for test count, time, errors, failures) to be printed once for each test (instead of only once per module).",0

There is one failing test included (which I believe is legitimate), that uncovers an issue with sideloading data. Summary of changes: - added flagEquals / stateEquals assertion helpers - added comments for test helpers - removed teardown for tests (all tests remained green after doing so) - cleaned up scoping for tests -- globals only used for configuration, locals used for test data - relocated helper functions to top of test - removed unnecessary var definitions - created a consistent test format: - test setup code is grouped together - test assertion code is grouped together - whitespace between setup and assertion code - comments above each individual assertion and setup block - each test should have a state and flag assertion after a model change state The new flagEquals() assertions and stateEquals() assertions should probably be audited to ensure that the state of the records should actually be what the assertion says they are. While re-writing these tests, I personally disagree with some of the flags set for the given record states.",0

7207,ES6 code cleanup,0.71306396,#4864 make ES6.Classes loose (#4864),"In Ember Data, there needs to be a mechanism for the system to refer to a record that has not yet been loaded. These references need to be as cheap as possible so that loading and processing data does not require materializing many full-blown DS.Models all at once. Previously, the mechanism for referencing unloaded/unmaterialized records was the client ID, a monotonically increasing number. Metadata about the unmaterialized record was saved in several different data structures in the store, indexed by client ID. Unfortunately, as the needs of Ember Data have grown, the number of data structures in the store have increased beyond their initial scope, leading to confusing, opaque code. This commit replaces almost all of the uses of client ID with the notion of a record reference. A reference is a simple JavaScript object that contains all of the metadata for a single record. For example, when you load data into the store via load, it will be saved inside the record reference. When you find the record, via e.g. App.Post.find(1), the materialized record will also be saved inside the record reference. This commit also comes with several convenience methods for dealing with record references on the store.",1

Previously, the inverse on all of the child records (their ""foreign keys"") were nulled out. Unfortunately, this was also happening when the has-many array had not been materializing—meaning that deleting a record could actually cause all of the records in its has-many relationships to be retrieved from the adapter! This commit only implements the above-described behavior in instances where the has-many relationship has been materialized. In cases where it has not been materialized, only those records which have already been coincidentally materialized on the client have their inverse cleared, to preserve the correct state on the client. For unmaterialized records, we assume the adapter (or more likely, the server, in the case of REST) will be responsible for maintaining the invariant. Also, this fixes the previous failing unit tests. Sorry about that.",0

The support for sideloadAs is only for backward compatibility. Two hooks exist for the serialization and materialization of an embedded polymorphic association: * addType that adds the record's type to the serialized data * extractEmbeddedType that retrieves the record's type from the payload. Both hooks rely in the JSONSerializer on keyForEmbeddedType, which returns the string used to represent the record's type in the payload. The default value is 'type'",0

This happened if a parent with unmaterialized children was deleted. Because of this situation, we needed to make the relationship change objects more standalone, and change the infrastructure to use clientIds internally instead of expecting at least the child to be materialized. This change is somewhat destabilizing, and I realized that he don't have coverage of didSaveRecord(), but it's necessary. This change also makes several public methods on OneToManyChange, which is passed to the adapter, and requires that adapters acknowledge updates to the relationships, because of the possibility that a relationship change can need to be persisted even if the associated record is not loaded (i.e. the above deletion case).",1

Highlights: 1) DS.Model#toJSON() now accepts more arguments to change how it serializes relationships 2) WIP on adapters being more active participants in deciding what records need to be committed 3) Changed belongsTo attributes no longer write ids to the record's data proxy 4) Records can be moved from the loaded.saved state to a new relationshipsInFlight state. This means that the record has changed relationships but not changed attributes that need to be persisted 5) Transaction now includes records that are not dirty but have changed relationships when calling an adapter's commit method (in the updated array of records),0

This is because the logic for removing them was in the deleted.start enter transition event, but new records that are deleted transition directly to the deleted.saved state (because deleting a new record is effectively a no-op; the adapter should never be notified about the record). As part of this change, we now have records that transition from created.uncommitted directly move themselves to their transaction's clean bucket (as they do not need to be sent to the adapter). This also fixes a bug where updated and uncommitted records were moving themselves to the clean bucket. Only newly created records should do this; updated records should move to the transaction's deleted bucket when deleted.",1

A record corresponds to a single entry in the persistence layer, as loaded by the adapter. To support this change, DS.ModelArray and its subclasses are now named DS.RecordArray. Since you should not be using these class names directly (but rather have them returned by store methods such as find() and filter()), this should not be a breaking API change and thus we have not updated the API revision number.",0

7978,chore(deps): update code-quality (#8311),0.6329598,#4962 Update to use built-in debug code stripping functionality.,"This allows you to return a JSON response like: {     person: {       id: 1,       name: ""Yehuda"",       phone_numbers: [ 1 ]     },     phone_numbers: [       { id: 1, number: ""555-5555"" }     ]   } You can sideload data in any response. If the data has the same key as an association of the object being loaded or updated, ember-data will assume the type specified for that association. If you want to include unrelated data, you can specify a mapping property on your adapter: var adapter = DS.RESTAdapter.create({     mapping: {       summary: App.Summary     }   }); This will mean that any time ember-data sees an unexpected summary attribute on the response JSON, it will load the data as hashes for the App.Summary type.",0
