Having this available provides a number of benefits to security tooling.

1044,[BUGFIX] Entangle Errors.errorsFor properly,"We recently made some changes to the way arrays get consumed when autotracking in Ember - specifically, whenever an array is return from Ember.get, @computed, or @tracked, we track that array for changes in the future. Previously, we also tracked it if it was an EmberArray. This check was a bit redundant, and costly, so we removed it and now only do it for native arrays. The reason this is generally safe is that non-native EmberArrays usually have a contract - you must access the state of the array via objectAt, and you must update via pushObject, popObject, etc. The array is consumed when using objectAt, so theres no need to do it eagerly in Ember.get (and penalize all other object access). The Errors class is a bit of a special case, because it adds additonal capabilities - the errorsFor method, which returns a subset of errors in the array. This info is accessed via the errorsFor() method, which does not consume the array proxy at all. So, previously, if a user did something like: js model.errors.errorsFor(field).map(error => error.message); When model.errors was accessed, it was a @computed property, and it consumed the entire array proxy. Later on, when the user goes to add an error, it adds the error to the main array and the subarray returned by errorsFor(), and dirties both, so the user's code is called again and updates properly. With the recent changes, that doesn't happen anymore. Since errorsFor returns a native array (with prototype extensions enabled), map does not use objectAt internally either. So, there is nothing that is properly consuming the array. This PR adds the consumption manually. In the future, we can likely add a primitive that allows Errors to create and manually manage tags, or it can use something along the lines of a TrackedArray for these errors instead.",[BUGFIX] Entangle Errors.errorsFor properly,"We recently made some changes to the way arrays get consumed when autotracking in Ember - specifically, whenever an array is return from Ember.get, @computed, or @tracked, we track that array for changes in the future.

I think we should continue running Travis CI alongside this for a little while to make sure everything is working correctly but we should remove the Azure Pipelines config. Why?  This GitHub version runs much faster because we're given more   resources to run jobs concurrently. The syntax is also nicer, which is my opinion of course but it seems   to be shared by others.  Stages The jobs are configured to run in three stages, each only running once all of the jobs in the previous stage have passed:  lint & basic-tests floating-dependencies, lts, releases, additional-scenarios external-partners  This setup is intended to make sure that one build is not using all of the repo's allowed jobs. It is a trade off between speed and resource availability that we might want to tweak in the future. Allowed failures GitHub actions, like Azure Pipelines, doesn't provide a feature like Travis CI's allow_failures, which allows a job to fail without failing the entire build.  As a workaround, this uses the continue-on-error feature to allow some external partner tests to fail without failing the entire build. The downside is that it is difficult to know when these jobs are actually failing since they appear to have passed in GitHub's UI. We will likely want to do something to address this in the future.

Having ember-fetch as a direct dependency of ember-data has proven troublesome. There are issues using ember-fetch as a nested dependency (these are documented in the ember-fetch README), but it is also quite difficult for ember-data to ensure that the versions of ember-fetch provided will actually include the correct version (duplicated addon merging in the ember-cli addon space is complicated and error prone). This change moves the determineBodyPromise and serializeQueryParams helper functions directly into @ember-data/adapter. A future version of ember-fetch will drop these utilities (as well as the ember-data adapter mixin).

2029,"[BUGFIX publish] add script to handle release logic, work around OTP issues"""," Ensures that yarn build:production is run for each ""addon"" package Separates out versioning from packaging and publishing Updates the RELEASE documentation  We require 2fa to publish ember-data, but 2fa tokens expire after 30s. lerna publish which handles versioning, packaging, and publishing does not itself accept an OTP for 2fa and when passed as an environment variable it is likely to have long expired prior to reaching the publish step. Our script separates out these steps so that we can recover from publishing errors more gracefully, and surfaces the OTP prompt (and reprompt) at the correct point in time for the publish. The opportunity was taken here to add guard rails around many of the finer points of our release process. Outside of branching that occurs at the beginning of the release cycle and changelog updates our release process is not mostly automated.","[BUGFIX publish] add script to handle release logic, work around OTP issues""","Ensures that yarn build:production is run for each ""addon"" package Separates out versioning from packaging and publishing Updates the RELEASE documentation We require 2fa to publish ember-data, but 2fa tokens expire after 30s. lerna publish which handles versioning, packaging, and publishing does not itself accept an OTP for 2fa and when passed as an environment variable it is likely to have long expired prior to reaching the publish step.

2337,Refactor argument parsing for --instrument and --record-data-rfc-build,"This simplifies and reorganizes the process.argv processing that needs to be done for the two flags that we support. This commit migrates the instrument flag handling to a single file (lib/heimdall-utils.js) and uses that single exported function throughout the rest of the code. It also removes the reliance on process.env string coercion (which apparently can be broken when you've reassigned process.env). It also changes around the details of the previous --record-data-rfc-build flag. Instead, we add a --disable-record-data-rfc-build flag (because as of 3.5 beta's the record data code is enabled by default). During this refactor, the config hook was migrated into the dummy app itself, so that ember-data no longer adds that flag to all consuming app's runtime config.",Refactor argument parsing for --instrument and --record-data-rfc-build,"This simplifies and reorganizes the process.argv processing that needs to be done for the two flags that we support.

2386,[DOC release] Fix misleading documentation: AdapterPopulatedRecordArray,"In my experimentation, I've discovered that though the promise returned from store.query() does have array-like methods on it, the actual AdapterPopulatedRecordArray is what the promise resolves to. For example, the length property of the object returned from store.query will always be 0. The object which the promise resolves to will represent the actual length of the records that were queried. The documentation for store.query states plainly that the AdapterPopulatedRecordArray is the resolution of the promise, but the documentation here misrepresented that. For example, the original code actually would behave like this: ```javascript   // GET /users?isAdmin=true   var admins = store.query('user', { isAdmin: true }); admins.then(function() {     console.log(admins.get(""length"")); // Throws: ""admins.get"" is not a function   }); ```",[DOC release] Fix misleading documentation: AdapterPopulatedRecordArray,"In my experimentation, I've discovered that though the promise returned from store.query() does have array-like methods on it, the actual AdapterPopulatedRecordArray is what the promise resolves to.

Unfortunately, this code was factored in a way that relied on mutating internal private state of the underlying Ember.ComputedProperty instance when Ember.testing was true (which was used as a way to determine prod vs non-prod). When this code was introduced (2014-12-02), setting _cacheable on a ComputedProperty instance would have worked as intended, however a refactor in Ember (ironically one day prior, but on Ember's canary channel) deprecated using _cacheable or .cacheable() (in favor of opting out of caching via .volatile()).

Even though we had a config/ember-try.js with many scenarios, none of them properly removed the ember-source version (even though ba7f46221 was specifically trying to do this :sob:). The fundamental issue here is:  ember-try supports removing packages, but requires that you specify them   in the dependencies or devDependencies objects.  Since my changes in   ba7f46221 added ""ember-source"": null to the root of the npm config   it was completely ignored :disappointed:. ember-source emits a warning to the console when it is present and   the bower package for ember is in use.  Unfortunately, this warning is   a bit misleading (it doesn't tell you that the ember-source from npm   will always win). The ember-source addon should be updated to throw an   error when this misconfiguration is detected. ember-cli will always use ember-source if it is present, and   completely ignore whatever is in bower.json.

3824,[FEATURE ds-serialize-ids-and-types] Create a new ids-and-types embedding strategy for non STI polymorphic hasMany,"Taking as example this scenario: ```js User = DS.Model.extend({   name:    DS.attr('string'),   pets: DS.hasMany('pet', { polymorphic: true }) }); Pet = DS.Model.extend({   name: DS.attr('string'), }); Cat = Pet.extend({   // ... }); Parrot = Pet.extend({   // ... }); ``` As of today, when using the DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin in a serializer and configuring the serialization stategy like this: attrs: {   pets: { serialize: 'ids' } } The relationship is serialized: json     {       ""user"": {         ""id"": ""1""         ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",         ""pets"": [1,2]       }     } This works ok if the polymorphism is based on STI, but that is just one specific implementation does not cover all use cases. Probably when a hasMany relationship is polymorphic the serialization should generate an array of object containing id and type by default, but at this point this can't be changed because it would break apps in the wild. Because of that a new serialization strategy named ids-and-types has been created that covers this use case. Probably this should become the default behavior of the ids strategy in ember 3.0, but not for now. For the same example above, this stragegy would generate the following payload: ```js {   ""user"": {     ""id"": ""1""     ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",     ""pets"": [       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Cat"" },       { ""id"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Parrot""}     ]   } } ```  Note that with this strategy if the differenty type of records don't whare the same ids space, that is not a problem. ```js {   ""user"": {     ""id"": ""1""     ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",     ""pets"": [       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Cat"" },       { ""id"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Parrot""} // Same id, but different type     ]   } } ```",[FEATURE ds-serialize-ids-and-types] Create a new ids-and-types embedding strategy for non STI polymorphic hasMany,"Taking as example this scenario: module As of today, when using the DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin in a serializer and configuring the serialization stategy like this: attrs: {   pets: { serialize: 'ids' } } The relationship is serialized: json     {       ""user"": {         ""id"": ""1""         ""name"": ""Bertin Osborne"",         ""pets"": [1,2]       }     } This works ok if the polymorphism is based on STI, but that is just one specific implementation does not cover all use cases. Probably when a hasMany relationship is polymorphic the serialization should generate an array of object containing id and type by default, but at this point this can't be changed because it would break apps in the wild. Because of that a new serialization strategy named ids-and-types has been created that covers this use case. Probably this should become the default behavior of the ids strategy in ember 3.0, but not for now. For the same example above, this stragegy would generate the following payload: module Note that with this strategy if the differenty type of records don't whare the same ids space, that is not a problem. module"

5262,Sort query params in ajax calls.,"When developing APIs, is pretty common to place a high level caching mechanism, like Varnish, to cache requests to public API endpoints, and those tools use the URL string to determine if they have a cached response. As an example, if one user requests /posts?sort=price&category=pets and another requests /posts?category=pets&sort=price, the cached request won't be used in the second call. Varnish by example has some modules to sort query parameters when caching, but it's not the default behavior and requires custom config. Although the URL specification does not say that the order of the query parameters is meaningless, in the bast mayority (read: all) of the APIs I've seen, 2 requests are considered identical regardless of the the order. Because of that, sorting the query params consistenlty is considered a good practice, so this PR introduces a sortQueryParams key in the RESTAdapter class, that defaults to a function to sort query params alphabetically. In case you don't want this behavior, setting that property to a falsey value in the ApplicationAdapter will respect the original order. In case you want a different order, you can pass a function that does the sorting your way. As other customization in ED, this can be customized on a per resource level, in case the order matters in only a few endpoints.",Sort query params in ajax calls.,"When developing APIs, is pretty common to place a high level caching mechanism, like Varnish, to cache requests to public API endpoints, and those tools use the URL string to determine if they have a cached response.

It separates the path through which server side and client side updates happen, which lays the ground work for tracking relationship changes. 2. When pushing records into the store, it splits the push process into three phases using a custom runloop: a) Push primary key data and attribtues b) Turn foreign keys into records c) Update relationships The runloop changes have the effect of making pushing relationships at least 50% faster, more if you have more relationships. It also fixes bugs like #2210",Schedule relationship normalizaiton and split paths for canonical/client relationship updates,"This PR makes several changes to relationship handling: 1.

6007,"Do not cache model factories on meta, or on other model CPs","Relationships are hard. Ember-Data has been storing data about a relationship on the meta value for that CP. CPs hang around though, and as a result that data on the meta becomes a cache. For some details about a relationship, this is fine. If User has many Posts, and you use User via a container, it would cache a reference to the Post factory. But if you then destroy that container, the reference to Post still exists in the CP meta. Furthermore, if you create a new container and use User and Post via that new container, the cache factory value for Post will be that of the old container and not the new container. This only is a problem if you expect to have Post be a different factory in each container. In ember-cli, MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS are enabled. This means all factories are extended before being returned by the container. So every time you have a new container, you have a new factory (though it looks and behaves the same). This change gets rid of that cache on meta. Instead it creates a function that accepts the store and meta, and returns the relationship object expected throughout Ember-Data. Two alternatives were considered:  Always check against typeKey instead of instanceof, but this felt like a dodge of the real problem and would leave the issue for others to find, or Create a new first-class relationship object, but this would be a far more invasive change, and would impact much of the codebase that the current relationship object has already leaked through.  Additionally, the types were being cached on model class-level CPs. For this patch, those have simply been marked cacheable(false). A later patch should refactor the CPs out of the way, or at least re-write their consumers to expect a relationship object without the factory itself already fetched.","Do not cache model factories on meta, or on other model CPs","Relationships are hard.

6011,[BUGFIX] Normalize typeKeys to always be camelCase,"typeKeys must have a strong formatting convention, since they are used for comparison in several spots of the code. Prior to this commit:  The container's normalized version of the factory name was set to     the typeKey. This leaked the container concerns about name     formatting up to Ember-Data, and to the user's interaction with     API calls like find('some-module') The typeKey property of a model class was allowed to pass into the     code without normalization.  In general, for a developer to know which to pick of find('some-car'), find('someCar') or find('some_cars') they had to understand which resolver their container was using. This demonstrates a bad coupling, and makes documenting Ember-Data exceedingly hard (we should not need to mention a caveat about picking a resolver). This commit normalizes typeKeys to always be camelCase, both those returned by typeForRoot (for which the documentation has been improved) and for those set on factories by modelFor.

6105,Deprecate App.Store in favor of App.ApplicationStore.,"This makes the application level store lookup much closer to the reset of our conventions (ala App.ApplicationAdapter and App.ApplicationSerializer). This change also allows specifying a custom store when using non-global resolver (i.e. EAK/ember-cli). Previously, we were only looking for a property Store hung off of the application instance. Now you can have a module named (in the case of stock EAK setup): app/stores/application or app/application/store.js (pods structure). A deprecation warning was added, and the prior technique still works so this is not a breaking change (although I believe that we should remove before the prior lookup prior to 1.0).",Deprecate App.Store in favor of App.ApplicationStore.,"This makes the application level store lookup much closer to the reset of our conventions (ala App.ApplicationAdapter and App.ApplicationSerializer).

6472,Update ember-dev to (b0b12c4).,Updates ember-dev to (b0b12c4) which includes the following changes:  Will not attempt to unshallow a full git repo Makes default test suite (packages only) run with features enabled and   disabled. Fixes bug where the wrong Project name is used in the auto-generated   CHANGELOG. Allows overriding the build type. (Simply set ENV['BUILD_TYPE']='canary') Add ember:generate_static_test_site task to create a static HTML   file for running the test suite. Add custom test results gathering for use in cross-browser testing. Make sure that the test file being used in the Assetfile is prefixed   with the proper dasherized project name (prior to this Ember Data   tests were still named ember-tests.js and now they will be   ember-data-tests.js). Fixes issue where local rake test runs would attempt to perform git   operations (checkout and cherry-pick). Now git operations will   only be attempted if ENV['CI']=true.

7207,Transition from client IDs to record references,"In Ember Data, there needs to be a mechanism for the system to refer to a record that has not yet been loaded. These references need to be as cheap as possible so that loading and processing data does not require materializing many full-blown DS.Models all at once. Previously, the mechanism for referencing unloaded/unmaterialized records was the client ID, a monotonically increasing number. Metadata about the unmaterialized record was saved in several different data structures in the store, indexed by client ID. Unfortunately, as the needs of Ember Data have grown, the number of data structures in the store have increased beyond their initial scope, leading to confusing, opaque code. This commit replaces almost all of the uses of client ID with the notion of a record reference. A reference is a simple JavaScript object that contains all of the metadata for a single record. For example, when you load data into the store via load, it will be saved inside the record reference. When you find the record, via e.g. App.Post.find(1), the materialized record will also be saved inside the record reference. This commit also comes with several convenience methods for dealing with record references on the store.",Transition from client IDs to record references,"In Ember Data, there needs to be a mechanism for the system to refer to a record that has not yet been loaded.

Previously, the inverse on all of the child records (their ""foreign keys"") were nulled out.

In cases where it has not been materialized, only those records which have already been coincidentally materialized on the client have their inverse cleared, to preserve the correct state on the client.

7764,WIP do more stuff in the adapter,The most important change here is that filters now materialize records. This is necessary because the records no longer store their backing data as a serialized hash. The long-term perfz plan (for situations with huge numbers of data hashes) is to integrate with something like crossfilter to filter out unneeded records before loading into the store.,WIP do more stuff in the adapter,The most important change here is that filters now materialize records.

Highlights: 1) DS.Model#toJSON() now accepts more arguments to change how it serializes relationships 2) WIP on adapters being more active participants in deciding what records need to be committed 3) Changed belongsTo attributes no longer write ids to the record's data proxy 4) Records can be moved from the loaded.saved state to a new relationshipsInFlight state. This means that the record has changed relationships but not changed attributes that need to be persisted 5) Transaction now includes records that are not dirty but have changed relationships when calling an adapter's commit method (in the updated array of records),WIP on moving relationships to adapter,This commit is a work-in-progress on our work to separate out the semantics between dirty records and changes to their relationships.
