While Adapters and Serializers will continue to work via the legacy-handler, these concepts are now entirely optional and users should expect that over the course of the 5.x series as the new request management story is further polished that these legacy concepts will be deprecated and removed from the recommended experience. They will, however, likely live on much longer since their implementation is now as an integration into the request-pipeline of the future and as such is something an application could choose to integrate and continue using.",feat: request-manager more docs more docs Add installation instructions fix link remove bad ref update docs more docs more niceness finish README doc full response docs stash work some updates cleanup compile delete file stash work update flow chart more updates to align with v2.1 cache update package name fix missing file more docs spike impl nice things test updates address feedback on readmes add request validator more tests more tests more tests polish streams support add abort controller support add Response handling fix lint more docs more docs rfc updates initial spike of new cache types update lockfile isolate changes isolate more things remove exp types udpate imports docs updates update docs finish overview fix lint fix test update lockfile skip fix for now fix tests fix unstable test we dont have prod tests for request manager yet so dont run them in prod actually fix url nvm fix content-length check,1

Update package.json to include the repository (#7725),0.4856279,4001 Add ember-publisher to package.json,"Hi there! This change adds the repository property to your package.json file(s). Having this available provides a number of benefits to security tooling. For example, it allows for greater trust by checking for signed commits, contributors to a release and validating history with the project. It also allows for comparison between the source code and the published artifact in order to detect attacks on authors during the publication process. We validate that we're making a PR against the correct repository by comparing the metadata for the published artifact on npmjs.com against the metadata in the package.json file in the repository. This change is provided by a team at Microsoft -- we're happy to answer any questions you may have. (Members of this team include @s-tuli, @iarna, @v-rr, @v-jiepeng, @v-zhzhou and @v-gjy). If you would prefer that we not make these sorts of PRs to projects you maintain, please just say. If you'd like to learn more about what we're doing here, we've prepared a document talking about both this project and some of our other activities around supply chain security here: microsoft/Secure-Supply-Chain This PR provides repository metadata for the following packages: * @ember-data/canary-features * @ember-data/private-build-infra * adapter-encapsulation-test-app * debug-encapsulation-test-app * eslint-plugin-ember-data * fastboot-test-app * model-encapsulation-test-app * record-data-encapsulation-test-app * relationship-performance-test-app * serializer-encapsulation-test-app * @ember-data/unpublished-test-infra Co-authored-by: msftenanceprovenance msftenanceprovenance@microsoft.com Co-authored-by: Scott Newcomer snewcomer24@gmail.com",0

Pass lid from relationship data to get record data,0.3971722,Improve links vs. local data for relationships,"The issue appeared in the sideposting scenario: model A has has many relationship to model B. instance of model A and instance of model B are created on the client, model A is saved along with model B sent in include section of   payload; the linking is done through lid server persisted both models and sent the response with   server-generated id along with lid sent by the client. when hasMany.updateData() was called while the response payload was   pushed to the store it couldn't match the record which was already in   the store with the record data contained in the relationship data   because lid was omitted. Add a test which ensures that the hasMany() relationship has correct status in the sideposting with lid scenario.",0

[BUGFIX] Entangle Errors.errorsFor properly,0.53755254,5340 [BUGFIX beta] Update DS.Errors#unknownProperty to return undefined.,"We recently made some changes to the way arrays get consumed when autotracking in Ember - specifically, whenever an array is return from Ember.get, @computed, or @tracked, we track that array for changes in the future. Previously, we also tracked it if it was an EmberArray. This check was a bit redundant, and costly, so we removed it and now only do it for native arrays. The reason this is generally safe is that non-native EmberArrays usually have a contract - you must access the state of the array via objectAt, and you must update via pushObject, popObject, etc. The array is consumed when using objectAt, so theres no need to do it eagerly in Ember.get (and penalize all other object access). The Errors class is a bit of a special case, because it adds additonal capabilities - the errorsFor method, which returns a subset of errors in the array. This info is accessed via the errorsFor() method, which does not consume the array proxy at all. So, previously, if a user did something like: js model.errors.errorsFor(field).map(error => error.message); When model.errors was accessed, it was a @computed property, and it consumed the entire array proxy. Later on, when the user goes to add an error, it adds the error to the main array and the subarray returned by errorsFor(), and dirties both, so the user's code is called again and updates properly. With the recent changes, that doesn't happen anymore. Since errorsFor returns a native array (with prototype extensions enabled), map does not use objectAt internally either. So, there is nothing that is properly consuming the array. This PR adds the consumption manually. In the future, we can likely add a primitive that allows Errors to create and manually manage tags, or it can use something along the lines of a TrackedArray for these errors instead.",0

This spec differs somewhat from the original 2.0 RFC, an updated RFC specifying the modifications will be published soon.

Ensure adapters and serializers are destroyed upon store destruction. (#7020),0.6603746,5305 Serializers and adapters should be unique per store,"Prior to this change, adapters and serializers were never destroyed. Commonly (and anecdotally) this is ""fine"" (heck this is the first report of the issue in years!), but it is pretty common for adapters to do async of their own (e.g. tracking adapter responses, exponential backoffs, etc) and without .destroy() being called on them there is no way for those adapters/serializer to ensure that async is canceled appropriately.",0

[CHORE] Configure @typescript-eslint for linting TypeScript files (#6526),0.48135406,4333 [BUGFIX release] use es5 syntax for addon's index.js file,"Configure @typescript-eslint for linting TypeScript files This updates our ESLint configuration so that it also runs for TypeScript files using typescript-eslint. Details Adds @typescript-eslint/parser Adds @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin Disables all rules that cause linting TypeScript files to fail Renames bin/lint-js -> bin/lint-changed-js & yarn lint:js ->   yarn lint:js:changed to make it's purpose more obvious Updates bin/lint-changed-js to include linting TypeScript files Replaces yarn lint:prettier with yarn lint:js which runs ESLint   for JavaScript & TypeScript, including enforcing our Prettier config Updates all CI scripts to use yarn lint:js rather than yarn   lint:prettier Since we haven't been running eslint for TypeScript files, some files don't pass with our current eslint config. Any rules that were causing errors have been disabled temporarily so we can make any neccessary code changes enable the rules again separately. Enable prettier/prettier eslint rule for TypeScript files Enables the prettier/prettier eslint rule for TypeScript files and fixes any errors. Enable no-prototype-builtins rule for TypeScript files Enable the no-prototype-builtins ESLint rule for TypeScript files and fixes any errors. Enable no-empty-pattern rule for TypeScript files Fixes two no-empty-pattern errors by disabling the rule for the violating lines. I think this is actually a case where we're seeing false positives because the rule was originally not implemented with TypeScript in mind, so eslint is interpreting the type definition as an attempt to destructure. This needs at least an issue open in this repo but probably with @typescript-eslint as well. Enable no-console rule for TypeScript files Enable no-console rule for TypeScript files and ""fixes"" an existing error by telling eslint to ignore the line. I'm not sure if this case should be replaced with something else, such as the warn function from Ember Debug, but I'd rather address that separately. Enable no-empty rule for TypeScript files Enables the no-empty ESLint rule for TypeScript files and fixes any errors. Enable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars rule for TypeScript files Enables the @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars rule for TypeScript files and fixes the errors. There is one case where this rule was ignored inline because of a false positive. There is already an issue opened here at link",0

Use GitHub Actions for CI (#6472),0.64086103,7982 Add GitHub Actions to Dependabot and update actions (@ddzz),"Use GitHub Actions for CI This supersedes link but with GitHub actions rather than Azure Pipelines. I think we should continue running Travis CI alongside this for a little while to make sure everything is working correctly but we should remove the Azure Pipelines config. Why? This GitHub version runs much faster because we're given more   resources to run jobs concurrently. The syntax is also nicer, which is my opinion of course but it seems   to be shared by others. Stages The jobs are configured to run in three stages, each only running once all of the jobs in the previous stage have passed: lint & basic-tests floating-dependencies, lts, releases, additional-scenarios external-partners This setup is intended to make sure that one build is not using all of the repo's allowed jobs. It is a trade off between speed and resource availability that we might want to tweak in the future. Allowed failures GitHub actions, like Azure Pipelines, doesn't provide a feature like Travis CI's allow_failures, which allows a job to fail without failing the entire build.  As a workaround, this uses the continue-on-error feature to allow some external partner tests to fail without failing the entire build. The downside is that it is difficult to know when these jobs are actually failing since they appear to have passed in GitHub's UI. We will likely want to do something to address this in the future. Downsides GitHub Actions Workflows are still in beta so it's possible that there could be breaking changes. Ensure tags start a CI job. (#6475) Without this change, all pushed tags will not do a CI build (because there must be at least one positive match if any filtering is done).",0

Skip linting for release and lts branches,0.5046407,Release of 3.12 branch as an long term support branch,This updates the Azure pipeline config so that the lint job is skipped unless the pull request target or the branch name is master or beta. This helps to bring the Azure pipeline config closer to feature pairity with the config for Travis CI. I took a slightly different approach here by whitelisting the master and beta branches rather than trying to blacklist the many other cases where we want to skip the linting because this is easier to express using the syntax for expressions available in Azure. See link for an example of a build running for the master branch. See link for an example of a pull request build running that targets the master branch. See link for an example of a build that targets the release branch where the Lint job is skipped.,0

[BUGFIX release] Remove ember-fetch dependency. (#6077),0.817786,3653 [BUGFIX beta] Update the dependencies for Ember 2.0,"This change removes ember-fetch as a direct dependency of ember-data, and allows for this dependency to be provided by the host application or for users to directly use native fetch. Having ember-fetch as a direct dependency of ember-data has proven troublesome. There are issues using ember-fetch as a nested dependency (these are documented in the ember-fetch README), but it is also quite difficult for ember-data to ensure that the versions of ember-fetch provided will actually include the correct version (duplicated addon merging in the ember-cli addon space is complicated and error prone). This change moves the determineBodyPromise and serializeQueryParams helper functions directly into @ember-data/adapter. A future version of ember-fetch will drop these utilities (as well as the ember-data adapter mixin). In addition, this also enables usage of the global fetch if a fetch module is not provided.",1

Refactor argument parsing for --instrument and --record-data-rfc-build,0.52357864,8501 chore: update imports to support RFC tweaks (@runspired),"This simplifies and reorganizes the process.argv processing that needs to be done for the two flags that we support. This commit migrates the instrument flag handling to a single file (lib/heimdall-utils.js) and uses that single exported function throughout the rest of the code. It also removes the reliance on process.env string coercion (which apparently can be broken when you've reassigned process.env). It also changes around the details of the previous --record-data-rfc-build flag. Instead, we add a --disable-record-data-rfc-build flag (because as of 3.5 beta's the record data code is enabled by default). During this refactor, the config hook was migrated into the dummy app itself, so that ember-data no longer adds that flag to all consuming app's runtime config.",0

[bugfix beta] Fetch cancels unload,0.95685333,5376 [bugfix beta] Fetch cancels unload,"When fetching records, cancel internal model destruction if it is scheduled, ie if the model is dematerializing because it was unloaded. It is not possible to construct snapshots for dematerializing internal models.  Prior to this commit, this could happen when fetching a record in the same runloop that it was unloaded.  A straightfoward way of getting into this state was via store.findRecord('book', 1).then(b => b.unloadRecord) when the model is already cached in the store.  Under these conditions, the fetch is scheduled, then the promise fulfills with the cached record and is unloaded and then the scheduled fetch is flushed. [fix #5343]",1

Prevent build issues when linking ember-source.,0.90762377,5339 Prevent build issues when linking ember-source.,"Prior to this, we used our ember-data's own dirname as the default baseDir for any of our custom babel plugins. This baseDir is used to traverse all JS files in all deps (recursively) and ensure that if any of them are changed, the transpilation cache is invalidated. Once we swapped to using ember-source as an npm package this meant that we would be stating/hashing all files inside of node_modules/ember-source/. When using npm link ember-source this leads to a JS max heap errors (because of node_modules/ember-source/tmp/ being MASSIVE). This fixes that specific issue, by using the correct basedir for each individual plugin.",1
[BUGFIX beta] Remove non-functional (error prone) manual CP caching.,0.67024523,5196 [BUGFIX beta] Avoid cache related warnings during builds.,"The previous implementation was intending to cache relationships when in the production environment, but avoid caching them in development. Unfortunately, this code was factored in a way that relied on mutating internal private state of the underlying Ember.ComputedProperty instance when Ember.testing was true (which was used as a way to determine prod vs non-prod). When this code was introduced (2014-12-02), setting _cacheable on a ComputedProperty instance would have worked as intended, however a refactor in Ember (ironically one day prior, but on Ember's canary channel) deprecated using _cacheable or .cacheable() (in favor of opting out of caching via .volatile()). Since this has not worked since Ember 2.0.0, and it has not been an issue, this commit completely removes the manual caching / volatile swapping between prod/dev/testing environments.",0

Remove blueprints for Mocha < 0.12. (#5225),0.97599125,5225 Remove blueprints for Mocha < 0.12. (#5225),"Remove blueprints for Mocha < 0.12. ember-cli-mocha@0.12.0 was released quite some time ago (on 2016-11-23), and by all accounts has been well adopted. Supporting both mocha test blueprints indefinitely is untenable, and now seems like as good a time as any to drop the blueprints for the older syntax. Note: this does not remove support for anything, it merely makes it slightly less convienient to create new test files for adapter/model/serializer/transform objects when your application is using Mocha < 0.12. Update to the latest ember-cli-version-checker. This is unblocked by removing the need to ""Fake"" the version checker in the blueprint test suite (the way ember-cli-blueprint-test-helpers fakes out ember-cli-version-checker@1 no longer works with ember-cli-version-checker@2).",1

Prior to this commit, if that null was one of the sideloaded (i.e. included) resources, the store would throw trying to get the null's type. This commit makes the serializer drops any nulls out of the list of included resources to avoid this problem. To summarize, if your API attempts to include resources that you don't have models for, a warning will be emitted and they will be ignored. Fixes #4568",1

Ensure we are properly testing multiple Ember versions.,0.6660385,Re-release of Ember Data 3.3.0-beta.1,"Prior to this commit (since c2ca068) we were only testing ember-source@2.11. Even though we had a config/ember-try.js with many scenarios, none of them properly removed the ember-source version (even though ba7f46221 was specifically trying to do this :sob:). The fundamental issue here is: ember-try supports removing packages, but requires that you specify them   in the dependencies or devDependencies objects.  Since my changes in   ba7f46221 added ""ember-source"": null to the root of the npm config   it was completely ignored :disappointed:. ember-source emits a warning to the console when it is present and   the bower package for ember is in use.  Unfortunately, this warning is   a bit misleading (it doesn't tell you that the ember-source from npm   will always win). The ember-source addon should be updated to throw an   error when this misconfiguration is detected. ember-cli will always use ember-source if it is present, and   completely ignore whatever is in bower.json. IMHO, this default was not   correct and ember-cli should have done the same thing that ember-data   did during its migration from bower to npm: if both packages are present   default to bower.json version with a warning.",0

"[BUGFIX release] relationship [x, y] should not break on x.unloadRecord()",0.698548,5048 [BUGFIX release] createRecord should only setup relationships it has … (#5048),"For an async relationship [x, y] with x.unloadRecord(), now adjusts only the relationship’s currentState, leaving that relationship’s canonical state alone, ensuring the existing client-side delete semantics are preserved. But when that relationship is reloaded, the canonicalState consulted. For sync relationship [x, y] with x.unloadRecord(), both currentState and canonical state are updated. This is to mirror the client-side delete semantics. But since we cannot reload a sync relationship we must assume this to be the new canonical state and rely on subsequent push or adapterPayloads or manual store.push to update. This aims to: [FIX] hasMany arrays never contain dematerialized records (so they no longer become broken) [FIX] using unloadRecord as a type of client side delete is restored [PRESERVE] the garbage collector pass to cleanup orphaned models [PRESERVE] second access to a relationship which did contain an unloadRecord to cause a reload note: if both sides of a relationships are unloaded, the above doesn’t apply. This is largely just when members of a loaded relationship are themselves unloaded. [fixes #4986 #5052 #4987 #4996]",0

Ensure ember-data/-private module is emitted properly for ember-cli < 2.12. (#5031),0.9828851,5022 Ensure ember-data/-private module is emitted properly for ember-cli < 2.12. (#5022),ember-cli@2.12 and higher have the addon itself responsible for transpiling modules so that the output of the treeForAddon hook is expected to be AMD. Prior versions of ember-cli (i.e. < 2.12) do second pass (that is not possible to disable) to transpile the output of treeForAddon again (to transpile modules). This commit changes things around leveraging ember-cli-babel@6's built in ability to detect the various ember-cli version scenarios and either transpile ember-data/-private down to AMD or not correctly.,1

There are several issues with the current code base: in general, if the serializer returns an array for the primary data   returned by normalizeQueryRecordResponse, then store.queryRecord   resolves with an array if rest serializer is used and an array is returned by the adapter,   then the first entry of the array is used as primary data and   store.queryRecord resolves with the first record if json-api serializer is used and the primary data is an array, then   store.queryRecord resolves with an array of the primary records the API documentation for queryRecord is similar to query and   doesn't indicate when this method should be used in contrast to   store.query and getting the first record of the array an assertion for the payload returned by the adapter for queryRecord   not being an empty object has been added in 2.4, which is a regression   to the behavior of 2.3 This commit addresses the above issues and makes the following changes: add assertion that store.queryRecord never resolves with an array add deprecation warning for the rest-serializers' queryRecord, if an   array is returned instead of a single record removes the assertion that the returned payload from the adapter for   queryRecord is not an empty object add assertion within json-api serializer that the primary data of the   normalized response is not an array",1

[FEATURE ds-payload-hooks] Add hooks to map type in payload to modelName,0.98997164,4318 [FEATURE ds-payload-hooks] Add hooks to map type in payload to modelName,"The modelNameFromPayloadKey and payloadKeyFromModelName hooks on the serializer allow to customize the mapping between the key of a JSON and the corresponding name of the model. Consider the following payload: json {   ""blog/post"": {     ""id"": 1   } } To map the ""blog/post"" key to the post model, the modelNameFromPayloadKey hook is used: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""blog/post"") There are some issues with the current code base, as the modelNameFromPayloadKey and payloadKeyFromModelName hooks are also used to map the ""value"" of a type from / to the payload. Consider the following payload of a JSON-API document: json {   ""data"": {     ""id"": 1,     ""type"": ""API:V1::User""   } } To map the namespaced type to the model name ember-data is using, currently the modelNameFromPayloadKey is used: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""API::V1::User"") Now this gets complicated if your API responds with the following payload (using custom key and custom types for polymorphic records for example): json {   ""blog/post"": {     ""id"": 1,     ""user"": 2,     ""userType"": ""API:V1::Administrator""   } } Now the modelNameFromPayloadKey is invoked for both: js serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""blog/post"") serializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey(""API::V1::Administrator"") This means that the logic within the hook would get complicated. As the name suggests, the method should only be used to map the key, not the value. This commit adds modelNameFromPayloadType and payloadTypeFromModelName hooks and uses them during normalization and serialization. This commit maintains the old behavior using, if it is used and logs a deprecation warning to move to the new hooks.",1

[FEATURE ds-improved-ajax] Finer control over customizing a request,0.9585478,3099 [FEATURE ds-improved-ajax] Finer control over customizing a request,"Though ajax() (and ajaxOptions()) of DS.RESTAdapter are marked as private, they have been overwritten in many applications, since there is currently no other way to customize the request. This feature adds new public methods to DS.RESTAdapter, which allow to customize the properties of a request: methodForRequest to get the HTTP verb urlForRequest to get the URL headersForRequest to get the headers dataForRequest to get the data (query params or request body) The params hash passed to those methods has all the properties with which the corresponding find, createRecord, findQuery, ...  call have been invoked: store, type, snapshot(s), id(s) and query. The requestType property indicates which method is requested; the possible values are: createRecord updateRecord deleteRecord query queryRecord findRecord findAll findMany findHasMany findBelongsTo Performing the actual AJAX request is handled by the _makeRequest method, which is similar to the existing ajax method: it makes the request using jQuery.ajax and attaches success and failure handlers. Say your API handles creation of resources via PUT, this can now be customized as follows: ``` js // adapters/application.js import DS from 'ember-data'; export DS.RESTAdapter.extend({   methodForRequest: function(params) {     if (params.requestType === 'createRecord') {       return ""PUT"";     } return this._super(...arguments); } }); ```",1

Probably when a hasMany relationship is polymorphic the serialization should generate an array of object containing id and type by default, but at this point this can't be changed because it would break apps in the wild. Because of that a new serialization strategy named ids-and-types has been created that covers this use case. Probably this should become the default behavior of the ids strategy in ember 3.0, but not for now. For the same example above, this stragegy would generate the following payload: module Note that with this strategy if the differenty type of records don't whare the same ids space, that is not a problem. module",1

This moves the storing of metadata to AdapterPopulatedRecordArray.loadRecords since, at the time that that method is called, the payload is present, so we don't have to use store.{_setMetadataFor,_metadataFor}. store._metadataFor was only used in AdapterPopulatedRecordArray.loadRecords, so it is no longer needed with this new implementation.",1

The exit handler has been implemented in the course of #1755, but the reported issue in that PR seems to be fixed ever since elsewhere in the code base, since the added test back test still is green.",1

Interestingly, for such payloads, arrayHash passed into normalizeArray() in rest-serializer.js contains Ember.Object instances as opposed to plain objects. This causes the code to throw, since hash.type would be a computed property in that case. This is probably because of extending from JSONAPISerializer.",1

refactor store managed instances,0.43050063,4662 Code Cleanup for store.js,"In this commit, we refactor store managed instance lookups to have its own class that takes the store's container. This moves a large portion of code out of the store and instead uses delegation. There's also a performance benefit: If you look up adapter:post and fallback to adapter:application, this lookup is cached. So, if you look up adapter:post again, that instance will actually be cached. Previously, we did the lookup for adapter:post every time. This also removes passing factories as the adapter property to DS.Store. closes #3050",0

Similarly, nearly all private API's have undergone significant change, if your app previously abused these APIs the most likely refactor is to use a custom model or a custom cache.","This commit adds an InternalModel class that is now used everywhere inside ED to represent models. This class is a fast Javascript object that contains all the data that we know for a particular record. At the ED/App code boundaries, such as responses to find, models being set/pushed to belongsTo/hasMany we convert between internalModels and DS.Models. This should be a huge performance win, because we now lazily create DS.Models which are pretty slow to instantiate. We need to wait for the new serializer/push refactor in order to use a push that does not immediately materialize a record to get further perf gains.

Fix bug where record rejected via find stayed in loading state,0.5485319,5216 [BUGFIX beta] invalid record becomes loaded when property is reset,"store.getById(typeClass, id) is used inside the rejection handler of find to get the record and invoke the corresponding hooks. This is buggy since the record is not loaded yet into the store - a successful find would mark it as such - and hence the store.getById returned null. That's why the hooks are not called and the record stays in the loading state, having the isLoaded flag still being set to false. The fix is to reuse the record parameter, which is passed to the find method. By this, the hooks are invoked and the record is passed transitioned out of the loading state.",0

Sort query params in ajax calls.,0.465012,3099 [FEATURE ds-improved-ajax] Finer control over customizing a request,"When developing APIs, is pretty common to place a high level caching mechanism, like Varnish, to cache requests to public API endpoints, and those tools use the URL string to determine if they have a cached response. As an example, if one user requests /posts?sort=price&category=pets and another requests /posts?category=pets&sort=price, the cached request won't be used in the second call. Varnish by example has some modules to sort query parameters when caching, but it's not the default behavior and requires custom config. Although the URL specification does not say that the order of the query parameters is meaningless, in the bast mayority (read: all) of the APIs I've seen, 2 requests are considered identical regardless of the the order. Because of that, sorting the query params consistenlty is considered a good practice, so this PR introduces a sortQueryParams key in the RESTAdapter class, that defaults to a function to sort query params alphabetically. In case you don't want this behavior, setting that property to a falsey value in the ApplicationAdapter will respect the original order. In case you want a different order, you can pass a function that does the sorting your way. As other customization in ED, this can be customized on a per resource level, in case the order matters in only a few endpoints.",0

It separates the path through which server side and client side updates happen, which lays the ground work for tracking relationship changes. 2. When pushing records into the store, it splits the push process into three phases using a custom runloop: a) Push primary key data and attribtues b) Turn foreign keys into records c) Update relationships The runloop changes have the effect of making pushing relationships at least 50% faster, more if you have more relationships. It also fixes bugs like #2210",0

Clarify that store.fetch documentation.,0.63396704,"What this means in effect is that store.request is now a much ... much more powerful API than store.query. Requests are capable of providing a cache-key or being cached by URL, with full lifecycle control and notification subscriptions. Documents are a first-class citizen of the Cache and EmberData more broadly, we are no longer just a resource-cache. For the full motivations and a discussion of all the various capabilities this unlocks we recommend reading the RFC",It was not clear that the returned promise when the record is already on the store will wait for the server to resolve.,0

This behavior was wrong for several reasons:   1.It prevented future rollback support for relationships   2.If you had nested URLs, you would not be able to send a DELETE request to /post/1/comments/1     because comment.get('post') would already have been deleted We now only clear the inverse side of the relationships when the record is deleted. The resulting refactor also enables us to add support for a record in a 404 state to be removed from relationships and for removing records from manyArrays that do not have inverses.",0

Refactor relationship handling code,0.53988314,4518 Update the relationship docs to remove some references to a globals s…,"This commit refactors relationship handling code. It adds full support for loading relationships described on only one side in the api. It sets up the infrastructure for separating server vs local updates to relationships. In a future PR, we will use that infrastructure to add support for rollback, relationship dirtying and relationship merging. Lots of old, crappy code, removed, -550 lines before new tests. Pushing records into the store is now 15-20% faster. Relationships now properly refetch if the links value is updated. We no longer churn records that are not changed in a hasMany push. fixes #1919 fixes #1814 fixes #2057 fixes #2191 fixes #2177 fixes #2125 fixes #2100 fixes #1790 fixes #1532 fixes #1389",0

Fixes hasMany records being duplicated after payload returns from server,0.61825585,⚡️Receiving and processing updated payloads for existing hasMany relationships is ~40% faster,"There is an edge case where a hasMany record gets duplicated (same ID). Basically, if we generate a record locally using UUID or any custom ID format, then push it to production which will return the same ID previously defined, the store's array that holds records to be resolved is going to duplicate both items, even if they have the same ID. This commit fixes that by not allowing duplicated IDs in that array.",0

It should be possible to do store.findQuery() twice and get two arrays where each has it's own meta information. However, because metadata is stored on the Model class, any subsequent request will modify the original pagination metadata.

"Do not cache model factories on meta, or on other model CPs",0.5675325,5743 drop use of MODEL_FACTORY_FOR,"Relationships are hard. Ember-Data has been storing data about a relationship on the meta value for that CP. CPs hang around though, and as a result that data on the meta becomes a cache. For some details about a relationship, this is fine. If User has many Posts, and you use User via a container, it would cache a reference to the Post factory. But if you then destroy that container, the reference to Post still exists in the CP meta. Furthermore, if you create a new container and use User and Post via that new container, the cache factory value for Post will be that of the old container and not the new container. This only is a problem if you expect to have Post be a different factory in each container. In ember-cli, MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS are enabled. This means all factories are extended before being returned by the container. So every time you have a new container, you have a new factory (though it looks and behaves the same). This change gets rid of that cache on meta. Instead it creates a function that accepts the store and meta, and returns the relationship object expected throughout Ember-Data. Two alternatives were considered: Always check against typeKey instead of instanceof, but this felt like a dodge of the real problem and would leave the issue for others to find, or Create a new first-class relationship object, but this would be a far more invasive change, and would impact much of the codebase that the current relationship object has already leaked through. Additionally, the types were being cached on model class-level CPs. For this patch, those have simply been marked cacheable(false). A later patch should refactor the CPs out of the way, or at least re-write their consumers to expect a relationship object without the factory itself already fetched.",0

normalizePayload only gets the payload,0.55062574,3832 Fix API docs for JSONAPISerializer.normalize,"normalizePayload has been living a lie. It claims to be passed the model type when called, but in often does not receive this argument (null is passed instead). This only serves to confuse the use-case for normalizePayload, and encourage its use when overriding an extraction helper is actually the right choice. This tradeoff, dropping the argument of type in all cases, means normalizePayload can still be run over data added with pushPayload. pushPayload knows nothing of which model is being pushed, and thus cannot provide the type reliably.",0
[BUGFIX] Normalize typeKeys to always be camelCase,0.6506201,3910 [BUGFIX release] Normalize attrs keys,"typeKeys must have a strong formatting convention, since they are used for comparison in several spots of the code. Prior to this commit: The container's normalized version of the factory name was set to     the typeKey. This leaked the container concerns about name     formatting up to Ember-Data, and to the user's interaction with     API calls like find('some-module') The typeKey property of a model class was allowed to pass into the     code without normalization. In general, for a developer to know which to pick of find('some-car'), find('someCar') or find('some_cars') they had to understand which resolver their container was using. This demonstrates a bad coupling, and makes documenting Ember-Data exceedingly hard (we should not need to mention a caveat about picking a resolver). This commit normalizes typeKeys to always be camelCase, both those returned by typeForRoot (for which the documentation has been improved) and for those set on factories by modelFor. From here on, find('someCar') should be considered the standard format for multi-word model names.",0

Remove underscores and rename,0.4806402,3534 Rename error attribute,"Having adapters and serializers with underscores in their names is causing issues with Ember Appkit's Resolver. The resolver will normalize the fullpath of the es6 module and calls Ember.String.dashserize on the fullpath. This converts the underscores to dashes, for example: -ams instead of _ams so the lookup becomes app/serializers/-ams and this of course cannot be found. This PR removes what can be argued as an unnecessary attempt to protect the adapter and serializer names from being overwritten, instead the convention to be pushed should be to have the names match the adpter/serializer class name. In addition, the ActiveModelAdapter's name was strangely called _ams and this does't match the class name at all. There is no 's' in the class name at all. Instead this PR has opted to rename both the adapter and the serializer active-model.",0

Fixes bug where the wrong Project name is used in the auto-generated   CHANGELOG. Allows overriding the build type. (Simply set ENV['BUILD_TYPE']='canary') Add ember:generate_static_test_site task to create a static HTML   file for running the test suite. Add custom test results gathering for use in cross-browser testing. Make sure that the test file being used in the Assetfile is prefixed   with the proper dasherized project name (prior to this Ember Data   tests were still named ember-tests.js and now they will be   ember-data-tests.js). Fixes issue where local rake test runs would attempt to perform git   operations (checkout and cherry-pick). Now git operations will   only be attempted if ENV['CI']=true.

Fix rest adapter failing tests,0.76970583,4301 fix rest-adapter-test typo,,1
This PR represents a lot of refactor work on the rest_adapter_test unit tests.,0.6930437,4301 fix rest-adapter-test typo,"All of the tests which are passing have been modified to match their original passing conditions. There is one failing test included (which I believe is legitimate), that uncovers an issue with sideloading data. Summary of changes: - added flagEquals / stateEquals assertion helpers - added comments for test helpers - removed teardown for tests (all tests remained green after doing so) - cleaned up scoping for tests -- globals only used for configuration, locals used for test data - relocated helper functions to top of test - removed unnecessary var definitions - created a consistent test format: - test setup code is grouped together - test assertion code is grouped together - whitespace between setup and assertion code - comments above each individual assertion and setup block - each test should have a state and flag assertion after a model change state The new flagEquals() assertions and stateEquals() assertions should probably be audited to ensure that the state of the records should actually be what the assertion says they are. While re-writing these tests, I personally disagree with some of the flags set for the given record states.",0

Transition from client IDs to record references,0.45780188,4009 [FEATURE ds-references] More conistency for RecordReference,"In Ember Data, there needs to be a mechanism for the system to refer to a record that has not yet been loaded. These references need to be as cheap as possible so that loading and processing data does not require materializing many full-blown DS.Models all at once. Previously, the mechanism for referencing unloaded/unmaterialized records was the client ID, a monotonically increasing number. Metadata about the unmaterialized record was saved in several different data structures in the store, indexed by client ID. Unfortunately, as the needs of Ember Data have grown, the number of data structures in the store have increased beyond their initial scope, leading to confusing, opaque code. This commit replaces almost all of the uses of client ID with the notion of a record reference. A reference is a simple JavaScript object that contains all of the metadata for a single record. For example, when you load data into the store via load, it will be saved inside the record reference. When you find the record, via e.g. App.Post.find(1), the materialized record will also be saved inside the record reference. This commit also comes with several convenience methods for dealing with record references on the store.",0

Only enforce invariants for materialized records,0.44197994,4272 [BUGFIX beta] Don't unnecessarily materialize records,"If a record is deleted, its has-many relationships are cleared. Previously, the inverse on all of the child records (their ""foreign keys"") were nulled out. Unfortunately, this was also happening when the has-many array had not been materializing—meaning that deleting a record could actually cause all of the records in its has-many relationships to be retrieved from the adapter! This commit only implements the above-described behavior in instances where the has-many relationship has been materialized. In cases where it has not been materialized, only those records which have already been coincidentally materialized on the client have their inverse cleared, to preserve the correct state on the client. For unmaterialized records, we assume the adapter (or more likely, the server, in the case of REST) will be responsible for maintaining the invariant. Also, this fixes the previous failing unit tests. Sorry about that.",0

Added support for polymorphic associations.,0.61061645,3699 [refactor] add some tests asserting polymorphic relationships can be …,"App.User = DS.Model.extend({  messages: DS.hasMany(App.Message, {polymorphic: true}) }); App.Message = DS.Model.extend({   created_at: DS.attr('date'),   user: DS.belongsTo(App.User) }); App.Post = App.Message.extend({   title: DS.attr('string') }); App.Comment = App.Message.extend({   body: DS.attr('string'),   message: DS.belongsTo(App.Message, {polymorphic: true}) }); You need to configure the serializer to map to the correct type: DS.RESTAdapter.configure('App.Post' {   alias: 'post' }); DS.RESTAdapter.configure('App.Comment' {   alias: 'comment' }); Initializing an alias will automatically allow you to sideload this type. The support for sideloadAs is only for backward compatibility. Two hooks exist for the serialization and materialization of an embedded polymorphic association: * addType that adds the record's type to the serialized data * extractEmbeddedType that retrieves the record's type from the payload. Both hooks rely in the JSONSerializer on keyForEmbeddedType, which returns the string used to represent the record's type in the payload. The default value is 'type'",0

If such a hash is returned, the store will call the adapter's findAssociation method instead of findMany, passing through the hash. The findAssociation hook is responsible for calling store.materializeHasMany(model, key, ids), which fills in the hasMany association and marks it as loaded.",0

This happened if a parent with unmaterialized children was deleted. Because of this situation, we needed to make the relationship change objects more standalone, and change the infrastructure to use clientIds internally instead of expecting at least the child to be materialized. This change is somewhat destabilizing, and I realized that he don't have coverage of didSaveRecord(), but it's necessary. This change also makes several public methods on OneToManyChange, which is passed to the adapter, and requires that adapters acknowledge updates to the relationships, because of the possibility that a relationship change can need to be persisted even if the associated record is not loaded (i.e. the above deletion case).",0

WIP on moving relationships to adapter,0.48432738,"adapter, model, private-build-infra, serializer",This commit is a work-in-progress on our work to separate out the semantics between dirty records and changes to their relationships. Highlights: 1) DS.Model#toJSON() now accepts more arguments to change how it serializes relationships 2) WIP on adapters being more active participants in deciding what records need to be committed 3) Changed belongsTo attributes no longer write ids to the record's data proxy 4) Records can be moved from the loaded.saved state to a new relationshipsInFlight state. This means that the record has changed relationships but not changed attributes that need to be persisted 5) Transaction now includes records that are not dirty but have changed relationships when calling an adapter's commit method (in the updated array of records),0

As part of this change, we now have records that transition from created.uncommitted directly move themselves to their transaction's clean bucket (as they do not need to be sent to the adapter). This also fixes a bug where updated and uncommitted records were moving themselves to the clean bucket.

A record corresponds to a single entry in the persistence layer, as loaded by the adapter. To support this change, DS.ModelArray and its subclasses are now named DS.RecordArray. Since you should not be using these class names directly (but rather have them returned by store methods such as find() and filter()), this should not be a breaking API change and thus we have not updated the API revision number.",0

This meant that after   a change had been made, it was not possible to   determine the previous, ""server truth"" value. Now, a record has both a data hash and a   changes hash. This lays the groundwork for   transaction rollbacks, as well as saving the   foreign key on child records when they are added   or removed from a hasMany association. Now that data only holds server truth data and   not the changes, adapters should use the new   getJSON() method to determine what data should   be sent to the server.

If the data has the same key as an association of the object being loaded or updated, ember-data will assume the type specified for that association. If you want to include unrelated data, you can specify a mapping property on your adapter: var adapter = DS.RESTAdapter.create({     mapping: {       summary: App.Summary     }   }); This will mean that any time ember-data sees an unexpected summary attribute on the response JSON, it will load the data as hashes for the App.Summary type.",0
