1,fix(deps): update dependency got to v11 [security] (#4457),0.9229391,fix(deps): update dependency got to v11 [security] by @renovate in link,"Description The imports field is similar to exports. While exports allows a package to control how others can import it, imports allows it control how it wants to import other packages. The majority of the code can be shared with the already-implemented ExportsField and AliasMap, with just special parsing logic. Besides that, I just needed to setup the conditional for imports and some cleanup.

5,switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing (#1893),0.87657964,switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing by @chris-olszewski in link,"Description WEB-654. This is pairing PR from next.js link (not a breaking change though) to have necessary support to run sass-loader. Mainly, it adds near-dummy context in webpack-loaders as well as assigning specific module types for the scss / sass. I'm not entirely in favor of having internal custom module type logic in webpack loaders setup by extension - however next.config.js itself doesn't have enough information other than extension + loader to determine module type. Something would like to address. Co-authored-by: Justin Ridgewell justin@ridgewell.name",1

After 4529 that invariant became true. This PR does two things: - Removes pipeline from the global hash key inputs. - Adjusts the dry run JSON schema to move rootPipeline from globalHashInputs and instead attach it to a new root key, pipeline.

12,make filesystem root more unique,0.5244617,"  based on the root lockfile. The old behavior would explode the cache whenever the root lockfile changed. With this new behavior,","Description Fixes #4953 We had unintentionally dropped the PnP check in Go and reintroduced the check in Rust. This PR simply removes this check and returns us to the old unintentional behavior. I believe run should work as expected since we execute all tasks via yarn which automatically does the right thing with .pnp.cjs. (Also #4953 contains many reports of people using Yarn PnP with turbo just fine) This PR does not: - Add support for PnP with prune. That check was never accidentally dropped and I want to do a few more tests before enabling that. - Fixup our examples to work correctly with Yarn PnP. All of the ones I tried required adding some dependencies Reviewer notes: I apologize, but I ended up fixing all the clippy lints in the files I touched and not just the ones introduced from the behavior change. This resulted in the PR being larger than necessary. Testing Instructions Existing unit tests around yarn/berry detection now pass without the a .yarnrc.yml specifying nodeLinker: node-modules.

This is correct behavior for npm3-6, but is overly strict for npm7+ as npm will automatically install peer dependencies if they aren't provided. This partially addresses #4915, but doesn't handle the case where a workspace has peer dependencies that the host package doesn't provide.

Before, the contents of the tar would get anchored before attempting to write to disk, but in cacheItem, this affordance does not seem to exist. We could add it back, but the implementation looks different enough that it is easier to just pass in the repoRoot.

102,Update og,0.68459904,chore: update update-informer to 1.0 by @mgrachev in link,"Description I identified this issue when authoring a test for PostCSS. Here's how it goes: CSS chunk 1 loads with module chunk A and source = runtime. This marks chunk A as an available module chunk. The promise for A is the same promise as for CSS chunk 1, which is resolved in registerChunk because chunk 1 is part of the chunk group of the initial JS chunk. CSS chunk 2 loads with module chunks A and B. Since A is already available, we run into a different branch, where we only try to load B. However, since we're still using source = runtime, we don't actually attempt to load B and instead return a promise to the resolver of B. But B isn't part of the chunk group of the initial JS chunk, so it is never resolved. This hangs up the runtime entirely and breaks page hydration. Instead, we move the ""automatically resolving CSS chunks when source = Runtime"" from registerChunk (which wasn't quite correct either as far as I can tell) into loadChunk, which solves this issue. Testing Instructions I don't know if it's worth having a test case just for this, but this will technically be covered under the PostCSS test case in link. link WEB-1023",0

107,ignore .env file and .vercel directory (#2847),0.94525087,ignore .env file and .vercel directory (#2847) by @oddnavy,"Description The vdbg! macro works the same way as the dbg! macro, with the additional benefit of automatically calling ValueDebugFormat implementations. This means that you can do: rust vdbg!(42, asset_ident_vc); vdbg!(42, asset_ident_vc; depth = 1); and the macro will print out rust [src/main.rs:10] 42 = 42 [src/main.rs:10] some_vc = AssetIdent {     path: FileSystemPath {         fs: FileSystem(DiskFileSystem {             name: ""project"",             root: ""..."",         }),         path: ""..."",     },     query: None,     fragment: None,     assets: [],     modifiers: [],     part: None, } rust [src/main.rs:10] 42 = 42 [src/main.rs:10] asset_ident_vc = AssetIdent {     path: FileSystemPath,     query: core::option::Option,     fragment: core::option::Option,     assets: alloc::vec::Vec<(turbo_tasks::primitives::StringVc, turbopack_core::ident::AssetIdentVc)>,     modifiers: alloc::vec::Vec,     part: core::option::Option, } This is an ergonomic improvement over having to call .dbg() or .dbg_depth() manually in four major ways: 1. No need to be in an async context and call .await?: the macro will spawn a task on its own. This means that it is no longer necessary to convert a turbo_tasks::function to async just to debug one of its arguments. 2. No need to import the turbo_tasks::debug::ValueDebug trait. You can call turbo_tasks::vdbg!(...) directly, of vdbg!(...) if you have it imported already. 3. No need to call eprintln! or dbg!: vdbg! calls eprintln! directly under the hood, with the same format as dbg!. 4. It's just one macro, with support for the depth argument baked in.

This PR is a part of implementing WEB-848, supporting relay graphql transform in next.js. Historically we've been expanding ModuleOptionContext to have each own config (enable_mdx, enable_emotion...) but with new CustomTransformPlugin we can pass actual transforms instead, what WEB-955 aims. PR introduces new config option custom_ecma_transform_plugins to the ModuleOptionContext to support it. custom_ecma_transform_plugins is a struct have two fields, before / after which allows to specify order of custom transforms if it should be invoked before any core transform kicks in, or otherwise. This effectively deprecates existing options, notably custom_ecmascript_transforms and custom_ecmascript_app_transforms. It is currently not actively being used (next-swc have 2 places utilizing custom_ecmascript_transforms), we can consolidate to the new option instead. One another notable change is customtransformer's transform is now async fn. It is due to TransformContext have couple of Vc properties, that cannot be accessed in a sync transform fn.

118,Enable the summarize flag in help output (#4418),0.83299744,Enable the summarize flag in help output by @mehulkar in link,"This PR implements a TaskInput derive macro that allows users to define structures and enums that can be directly passed as arguments to tt::functions, provided they are composed exclusively of other TaskInput implementors (i.e. primitives for which we've manually implemented TaskInput, Vcs, and other structs that derive TaskInput). There are a lot of cases in Turbopack where we'd like to pass more advanced structures to tt::functions, but since there's no existing way to create composite structures and enums from existing Vcs and primitives, we end up with the following recurring patterns: Functions that have 6+ arguments For example: module By creating composite structures with arguments that are often used together and passed down the call tree, this can instead become: module Multiple optional arguments ... where only specific combinations make sense. module In this example, value2 might only make sense when value3 is also provided. An enum would be better in this case: module Value and serialization = ""auto_for_input"" For example: module This can now be replaced with: module Apart from conciseness and fewer trait bounds, another benefit of this approach is that SomeArgument cannot be (mis)used as a Vc, which we always generate via the turbo_tasks::value proc macro. How does it work? The derive macro generates code to convert enums and structs into a list of TaskInputs, similarly to how FromTaskInput was previously implemented for tuples. We use an additional integer discriminant to differentiate between enum variants. Concerns A potential concern of this approach is that these TaskInputs will be cloned on every single task execution. As such, they should be as lightweight as possible, and implement Copy where it makes sense. Testing Instructions I added a series of tests in turbo-tasks-memory. link WEB-945",1

In the ideal world this would be all of the root package.json, but serializing all of that via protobuf is overkill since berry is the only lockfile that needs that info and we only use that field. - Addition of patches FFI function, this wasn't needed before as NPM doesn't have patch files encoded in the lockfile - Addition of global_changes FFI function, previously for NPM we were just doing this in Go since there were just two fields we needed to check and parsing JSON is cheap. - Switches lockfile usage of berry from the Go implementation to the Rust one introduced in #4589 Reviewer notes: - The passing of the optional resolutions map is very icky and one off, but this is the only lockfile the requires additional information to properly parse. Once the package graph is squarely in Rust land this should go back to being more generic. This will finally close out #2791 Testing Instructions Added a new integration test that uses resolutions. This integration test invokes the new patches FFI call. For a full test of the new resolution feature, clone and follow the instructions in the repro The lockfile_aware_caching integration tests all hit the new global_changes FFI callsite and provide test coverage.

This allows the runtime logic to avoid loading chunks when all entry modules are already loaded.

285,Fix turbo.json schema generation,0.78331023,feat(types): update turbo.json schema by @tknickman in link,"Description This is a follow up to #4541 that fixes the underlying issue. We now will attempt to return the extracted version instead of the full key when we encounter one. A quick explanation for how this happened is that when pnpm aliases are used the resolved version in the lockfile will be the full lockfile key instead of a version since the name won't match the specifier (e.g. ""foo: npm:bar@^1.0.0"" will have a version of /bar/1.0.0 instead of just 1.0.0). This is all fine unless an external dependency also depends on bar@1.0.0 then we get a dependency of Package{Key: ""/bar/1.0.0"", Version: ""1.0.0""} when going through the external dependency where we would get Package{Key: ""/bar/1.0.0"", Version: ""/bar/1.0.0""} going through the workspace with the alias. Testing Instructions Updated the unit test added in the initial PR to reflect that we're no longer getting a package with a version that's actually a lockfile key.

The search string is .THASH. and can match things like GITHASH. Inferring env var inclusion based upon arbitrary substring inclusion regardless of position is too broad. (Should have been ^THASH_.+.) Squatting on an env var string not scoped to ^TURBO_.+ is (at least) not polite to the rest of the ecosystem. Using this feature makes it more-difficult to share caches across machines and create reproducible builds. Residual THASH variables from earlier arbitrary configuration can unnecessarily partition the cache. The interaction between this feature and ""strict"" environment variable mode introduces complexity where a user can't easily reason about the behavior. Should the THASH variable be included into the global hash if unspecified? Should the THASH variable pushed into the execution environment? The original goal of this feature is to be able to quickly and dynamically change the hash key for a run. I find that the implicit nature is anathema to our goals. Previous use cases and recommendations: - Compare cache artifacts across multiple runs: use run summary or --cache-dir. - Make sure everything runs: use --force. - SOMETHING_THASH=foo turbo run build is just a hardcoded env var.

There are also many new features, for example, HTTP2 support is finally live! :globe_with_meridians: If you find Got useful, you might want to sponsor the Got maintainers.  Breaking changes Removed support for module Due to the inconsistencies between the Electron's module module and the Node.js module module, we have decided to officially drop support for it. Therefore, the module option has been removed. You'll still be able to use Got in the Electron main process and in the renderer process through the module module or if you use Node.js shims. The Pagination API is now stable We haven't seen any bugs yet, so please give it a try! If you want to leave some feedback, you can do it here. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated! module API  The module behavior has been reverted back to the Got 9 behavior.     In other words, the options is only meant for the Got promise API. To set the encoding for streams, simply call module.  ```diff -got.stream('link', {encoding: 'base64'}); +got.stream('link'); // Promises stay untouched await got('link', {encoding: 'base64'}); ```  The error name module has been renamed to module for better readability and to comply with the documentation.  module  The module option now accepts only an object with module, module and module properties. While the module and module properties accept native module instances, the module property must be an instance of module or be undefined.  ```diff { -    agent: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}) } { +    agent: { +        http: new http.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        https: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        http2: new http2wrapper.Agent() +    } } ```  The module option is now set to a default instance of module. It cannot be a module-like instance anymore. The underlying module package has received many improvements, for example, it has received module file support! Additionally, the module option has been renamed to module. Note that it's no longer passed to Keyv, so you need to pass a Keyv instance it if you want to save the data for later.  ```diff { -    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ -        cacheAdapter: new Map() -    }) } { +    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ +        cache: new Keyv({ +            cacheAdapter: new Map() +        }) +    }) } // Default: {     dnsCache: new CacheableLookup() } ```  Errors thrown in module hooks will be converted to instances of module. modules provide much more useful information, for example, you can access the Got options (through module), which is very useful when debugging.  ```js const got = require('got'); (async () => {     try {         await got('link', {             hooks: {                 init: [                     options => {                         if (!options.context) {                             throw new Error('You need to pass a module option');                         }                     }                 ]             }         });     } catch (error) {         console.log(module);         console.log('Here are the options:', error.options);     } })(); ```  The options passed in an module hook may not have a module property. To modify the request URL you should use a module hook instead.  module Note that this example shows a simple use case. In more complicated algorithms, you need to split the module hook into another module hook and a module hook.  The module property is no longer a module instance. Instead, it gives a Got stream, which provides a set of useful properties.  ```js const got = require('got'); (async () => {     try {         await got('link');     } catch (error) {         console.log(module);         console.log('Download progress:', error.request.downloadProgress);     } })(); ``` Renamed TypeScript types Some of the TypeScript types have been renamed to improve the readability: Old type New type ResponseObject Response Defaults InstanceDefaults DefaultOptions Defaults DefaultRetryOptions RequiredRetryOptions GotOptions Options GotRequestMethod GotRequestFunction Other  Now requires Node.js 10.19 or later.  Enhancements HTTP2 support is here! Excited? Yay! Unfortunately, it's off by default to make the migration smoother. Many Got users have set up their own Agents and we didn't want to break them. But fear no more, it will come enabled by default in Got 12. ```js const got = require('got'); (async () => {     const response = await got('link', {http2: true});     console.log(response.socket.alpnProtocol);     //=> 'h2' })(); ```  The module function is slow (#​1016) Use module instead of module to compare errors (#​981) Pass error thrown in the module hook to module hook (#​929) Errors have undefined body when using streams (#​1138) Spaces should be normalized as module in query strings (#​1113) Modify response headers while using module (#​1129) Make module a Got stream (module).

374,spelling: meta framework,0.563097,chore: Fix spelling by @NicholasLYang in link,"Next.js side: link Description This is part one of a larger ChunkingContext refactor. In this episode, we: 1. Move the runtime and evaluation code off of the entry JS chunk and into a dedicated chunk. This means that, within a chunk group, instead of having one chunk that contains modules + runtime code and chunks that only contain modules, we'll have chunks that only contain modules and one chunk that only contains runtime code. 2. Start a larger enterprise of differentiating between ""intermediate"" chunks (ChunkVcs), and ""output"" chunks (raw AssetVcs). Before, we used EcmascriptChunkVcs to represent both intermediate chunks that would never actually be created (optimized away) AND final chunks that would be served or written to disk. Now, EcmascriptChunkVcs are only intermediate assets, and DevEcmascriptChunkVcs are the final chunks. 3. Move a few modules from turbopack-core to turbopack-dev, as their existence (or the implementation) is only meaningful in a dev context (ChunkList and Manifest*, the latter of which depends on the chunk list for now). Things left to figure out: 1. What does the Chunk trait represent here? We no longer use .chunking_context(), and .path() is redundant with Asset::path. However, it no longer makes sense for Chunks to be Assets as their content is determined by the chunking context. Should we have two traits, one for intermediate chunks and one for output chunks? 2. Should EvalutatedEntryVc just be ChunkableAssetVc? We don't need all of the trait methods of either, just an ident and a way to convert to a chunk. The Chunk trait could look like this: rust trait Chunk {   fn ident(&self) -> IdentVc;   fn parallel_chunks(&self) -> ChunksVc;   fn references(&self) -> AssetReferencesVc; } Things that will happen in the next part(s): 1. The ChunkGroupVc::evaluated logic will move into turbopack-dev, as it doesn't make sense in a build context.

But static rendering was a little more difficult, it has multiple paths that are immediately ready with a full body that I didn't want to break apart. So I kept the Response message for a full response that transforms into a ContentSourceContent::Static, and implemented a new enum type for streaming responses into a ContentSourceContent::HttpProxy. These is some weirdness with different data types on the headers field of a ContentSourceContent::Static's StaticContent and a ContentSourceContent::HttpProxy's ProxyResultVc.

It's important that the Tasks are connected to something that is active when consumers read from the stream. Also Vc reads need to invalidate the stream and cause the production of a new stream. That was not handled correctly before. Now we use a child task to produce the stream that is active as part of the function that returns the stream. We also use a little hack to update the stream in the parent task when the child task is invalidated. It's a bit hacky, but eventually this kind of logic should probably move into turbo_tasks as part of some streaming concept.

The regex is fairly permissive and would match any command that contained a path that ended in turbo e.g. rm ~/.turbo would get marked as invoking turbo. This PR restricts the regex so it only matches commands that contain turbo surrounded by whitespace. This means that we now won't throw if the user directly invokes turbo via a path e.g. ./node_modules/turbo/bin/turbo. I think this is the correct tradeoff as it's much more likely a user will invoke turbo via either turbo foo or pnpm turbo foo. Another possibility would be to attempt parse the scripts and do more exact analysis, but to do this and correctly handle Windows would be fun. Testing Instructions See new unit tests",0

Think of it a bit like a DuplexStream, it implements both a reader (that can be streaming read with the Stream trait) and a writer (that can be sent cross threads). As new values are written to the stream, any readers get woken up to receive the next value. Included as part of this is a rework of our ""bytes"" implementations, extracting some logic into a new turbo-tasks-bytes crate. Eventually, Rope should also move out of turbo-tasks-fs into this crate. BytesValue are cheaply clonable (they're just a wrapper around bytes::Bytes), making them a perfect low-level type to hold the data being sent between processes and threads. They're also easy to convert to and from a real Bytes, so that they can be streamed into our hyper::Server.

This adds boilerplate, but as this boundary should be short lived (only around until package graph gets moved into Rust) this is acceptable instead of coming up with a more generic solution. - If we stick with passing the lockfile contents for other implementations then we will be able to share the protobuf message definitions Co-authored-by: Alexander Lyon arlyon@me.com",1

I encountered an os.Exit sitting in run, and while attempting to address that, discovered that we don't fully stop on error even when we mean to. We stop executing scripts but we continue to walk the graph, meaning that we can trigger cache restorations. This PR: - Adds a short-circuiting mechanism to our graph walk so that tasks started after the failed tasks are skipped. Note that tasks started concurrently with the failed task may still run. - Remove the os.Exit for the case where we fail to do the setup work to capture task outputs - Adds a test for short-circuiting using a custom visitor to deterministically inject an error into graph traversal Testing Instructions New test in engine_test.go demonstrates short-circuiting by injecting an error into graph traversal. I opted for a unit test in this case because using a failing script in an integration test will not trigger the broken behavior. We shut down the script-running facility once a script fails. The error needs to occur outside of the user's script to demonstrate the bug, hence a custom graph visitor. Co-authored-by: Mehul Kar mehul.kar@vercel.com",1

We can't construct a full expected lockfile key from the patch entry anymore as the patch entry doesn't contain information about peer dependencies. To circumvent this we now scan through the entire package list, parse the key, extract the patch hash (if present), and then check if it matches a patch listed in patchedDependencies. Notes for reviewers: - A large portion of this PR is actually porting the lockfile key parsing logic that pnpm itself uses so we can extract the individual pieces that we care about. This logic is in a slightly messy state as the pnpm codebase is currently in a state where it supports v5 and v6 lockfiles. As mentioned in link once pnpm@8 lands this code will start to be refactored. I tried to keep the Go port as 1:1 as possible in hopes to make future maintenance easier. - This PR includes new logic for v6 as pnpm now encodes patches in lockfile keys: link Testing Instructions Added new packages to the pnpm lockfile fixtures that are patched and have peer dependencies.

This additionally fixes an issue where a dirty file not included in inputs could get included in the hash. Fix manual file hashing to use the correct prefix on globs (and to support exclusions) Modify globby to allow excluding individual files, not just directories We have behavior to force excludes in globby to apply to directories, but AFAICT we don't document this behavior. Our existing documentation of excludes in outputs uses **. My preference would be to drop it so that we have a unified globbing syntax. However, my code here special-cases user input that ends in ** to maintain both behaviors. Testing Instructions A new integration test uses inputs with an exclusion to exclude a file from the hash. The excluded file is modified in the test, then hash matching and full turbo are verified. Globby has a new test as well for excluding a single file, vs a directory. taskhash_test.go has an additional edge case to handle excluding files in inputs specifications that fall back to manual file hashing.

Furthermore, they can't be nested correctly, which is necessary for my future HMR work. Instead, @sokra proposed that we should always use ReadRefs instead. This PR introduces a way to generate ReadRef-like TraitRefs for a given trait Vc. The purpose of these refs is only to be passed around, to be converted back into a Vc eventually. You can't call any other method on a TraitRef. This serves the same purpose as cell_local, as you can ""snapshot"" a value pointed to by a trait Vc through a trait ref, and re-cell that snapshot at a later time (see the tests). However, this has the same pitfall as cell_local: nested Vcs will still update. @sokra proposed we should have ValueSnapshot types which flatten nested Vcs recursively, but this will have to wait until we have time to tackle tech debt. This also introduces the ReadRef::cell method, which works the same way as TraitRef::cell but can be used on ReadRefs instead.",1

When we write a file, we obviously have the input bytes (the bytes we want to write to disk). But we also read the file to see if the file needs to be written at all. This means we have another copy of the bytes, the ones that came from the disk. Worse, our write is strongly dependent on the read's RopeVc. Meaning we're stuck with that read memory until some indeterminate time. And any time we update the written contents, we're gonna get more bytes stuck in our Vc cache. The goal here is to track the file, so that we can rewrite it if it's modified/deleted. Why not have an API specific to tracking, without actually reading any contents? This PR does exactly that.

This demonstrates that detection based upon turbo.json (and the change made in #3938) is not (particularly) relevant to root identification. How to review: - Each commit is pretty self-contained. You can see me adding a debug line to assert against in the first commit. - The third commit is both a revert of #3938 and a full deletion of the turbo.json-included detection logic. OUTDATED There is one behavior change. If you previously: 1. Had nested workspaces (which is not supported by us or any package manager). 2. Had a module at the ""outer"" one. 3. Did not have a module at the ""inner"" one Then we would have selected the outer one. We now select the inner one, and throw an error because the inner one does not have a module. I believe this to be an improvement. 3938 treats any turbo.json that has comments in it as nonexistent since serde_json doesn't support JSONC. That everything still worked with parsing that is throwing an error made it clear that the turbo.json check was not being used except for the described edge case.",0

Yah, it's a bit of a mouthful with lots of very similar sounding names. Essentially, the old SourceMapContentSource and NextSourceMapTraceContentSource wrapped some inner ContentSource, and would request content from them, and process that content into a source map JSON or trace JSON. But, they didn't implement the NeedData response, so it only supported very primitive inner content sources. This PR extracts that knowledge into a single WrappedContentSource, which will recursively wrap every ContentSourceResult until we land on a fully resolved ContentSourceResult::Result. At that point, it hands off the work to a WrappedGetContentSource, which performs the processing on whatever content is returned by the inner GetContentSourceContent. If you can't tell yet, I'm making the description intentionally verbose to highlight just how similar our struct/trait names are. Fixes WEB-614",1

I expected this to make some difference in performance, as traversing references in parallel can lead to better CPU usage (see #3771), but in practice our benchmarks show no significant difference. Real apps might be a different story, but I didn't notice any particular performance improvement on vercel.com either. This implementation is not perfect (we're making more calls to get_children than strictly necessary), but I think it's enough to measure a potential performance improvement.

This expands handle_issues and the NextDevServerBuilder to accept an arbitrary IssueReporter -- a trait implementing report_issues which receives captured issues to send somewhere. This replaces using a fixed ConsoleUi to send issues to stdout/stderr, though ConsoleUi now implements IssueReporter and is the default implementation of an issue reporter if no other is provided. It also moves the responsibility of detecting fatal errors out of ConsoleUi and into handle_issues itself. This lays the foundation for alternative reporters, such as a test reporter to snapshot or assert against issues emitted, or a newline-delimited JSON reporter for other tools to consume.

953,Fix duplicate items in task summaries (#4217),0.8315001,Fix duplicate items in task summaries by @mehulkar in link,"In Turbopack, as a consequence of our lazy compilation model, CSS chunks can contain duplicate CSS chunk items. This can cause issues with precedence. Take the following example: Initial CSS chunk: module Dynamic CSS chunk (loaded after the first page load completes) module In this example, when the page first loads, the following rule will be applied: css h1 {   font-size: 4rem; } But as soon as the dynamic CSS chunk loads, the following rule will be applied instead: css h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } However, from the order of rules in the initial load, we know that the former should still apply. We can remedy this particular issue by wrapping each CSS chunk item into its own @layer (thanks @sokra for the idea!). This ensures that when a CSS chunk item is re-encountered at a later time, it is automatically de-duplicated thanks to the inherent CSS layering algorithm. This is not an issue in Next.js as we can't have duplicated CSS chunk items.",1

We need a NodeJsPoolVc to render pages 2. To get a NodeJsPoolVc, you need to write your files onto disk     - So a pool is dependent on the contents of those files 3. When we render an error page, we need to write those files to disk 4. The error page shares the same file entrypoint as the main page source So, to render an error, we write the entrypoint, which is shared with main source. This alone is pretty bad, because it will invalidate our page source's node pool (and kill those processes). But, the loop is triggered by a more subtle bug: When we write a file, we read it to see if the contents have changed. Writing creates a dependency on the read! So when the error page is written to disk, it invalidated the read we preformed when we wrote the main page. That invalidated the main page (and it's node pool), and so we rendered again. That wrote the main page's code to disk, invalidating the read of the error page performed when we wrote the error page. ♾️ (I'll be opening more PRs…)",0

Before a ContentSource returned a tuple of specificity and content. Now it returns a tuple of specificity and a get_content function. The old way made it very inefficient to combine multiple ContentSource. All combined ContentSources were ask before, all returned specificity and content, and they are ordered after that. That required to compute all contents, even if it is not really used after ordering. Now we order specificity and a get_content function and only compute the content (by calling get_content) with the final result. It also changes how data needs are expressed in the get_content function. Instead of asking it over and over again with more data, it statically returns the needed data with vary and the get function is only called with that data. This is technically more limited than the old way, but one can workaround that if needed. But practically we probably never need that. On the other hand it improves the number of function calls, since the vary method is only called once and the get only once per request. Before data needs required at least 2 get calls per request.",1

Adds tests, fixtures, and new transform boilerplate. Moved from meow to commander.js for arg parsing Reviewers Guide This PR is huge. But it’s almost all tests and fixtures. I have split the commits for easier review: 1. new arg parsing 2. rewrite transforms 3. add codemod generation 4. add migrate command 5. add tests FAQ Q. Why not just use jscodeshift?  A. It would be major overkill. We don’t need AST’s. Everything we touch (and likely will touch for the foreseeable future) is JSON. Q. Why add an extra class for file transforms? A. This abstracts away the need to care about the CLI options or handle output. Writing a new transform is as simple as - 1. read the file, 2. make changes, 3. pass it to runner.modifyFile. It does the rest (logging, determining when to write, file diffing, consistent outputs, consistent logging) TODO: [ ] Update codemod docs and in-product reccomendations",0

The UI struct is expected to be passed into any subcommands that need pretty output. - A slight behavior change is that we no longer delete the entire config file and instead make the token null (""token"": null).

Page data HMR is a bit more clever than it is in Next.js as we won't re-render a Node.js result for each page file update. Instead, thanks to the StripPageDefaultExport transform, there are three versions of the page chunks: * client-side (strips page data exports); * server-side (full); * data server-side (strips page default export). Instead of subscribing to the full server-side result, on hydration, the client-side page separately subscribes to: * client-side updates (already the case); * data server-side updates (new). This means that updating something that only affects the page component will only cause a client-side update and no Node.js re-rendering, while updating something that only affects the data will only cause a server-side update. ~~I'm marking this as a draft for now as there are still a few areas to test/investigate:~~ - [x] When something that is used in both the default page export and data exports is changed, this will cause two HMR updates: one data update, and one client-side chunk update. The same case breaks in Next.js, where we will receive a client-side update, but no server-side update, ending up with an incorrect result. - [x] Differences between getStaticProps/getServerSideProps, as well as getInitialProps (need to talk with @timneutkens about this) (see link) Co-authored-by: kodiakhq[bot] 49736102+kodiakhq[bot]@users.noreply.github.com",0

1211,improve error message (#433),0.7962911,Improved error messages,"The original transform The original behavior of the Next SSG transform is to remove getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getStaticPaths from Next.js page files so they can be bundled for the client. This is what enables the following code to work properly without advanced tree shaking: module The transform is able to remove both getStaticProps and all its exclusive, transitive dependencies, so this is what the client would see: jsx import PostCounter from ""components/PostCounter""; export var __N_SSG = true; export default function Home(props) {     return __jsx(PostCounter, {         count: props.posts.length     }); } Adding the inverse operation However, to support proper HMR for these data exports, we need to be able to execute somewhat of an inverse operation: remove the default component export, but preserve all the rest. This allows Turbopack to bundle server-side only declarations, only re-rendering when one of these changes, instead of re-rendering on any server-side and client-side change. From our module above, the updated transform is now also able to generate the following: jsx import db from ""db""; const postsPromise = db.getPosts(); export async function getStaticProps() {     return {         props: {             posts: await postsPromise         }     }; } As you can see, this module is no longer importing the PostCounter, which means re-rendering will not invalidate when that counter changes. However, if the ""db"" module changes, we will still be able to detect a change and re-render. Other notes I renamed the transform from ""next_ssg"" to ""next_transform_strip_page_exports"". It's much more verbose, but hopefully also much clearer about what it does at a glance. I took the liberty to clean up and comment some parts of the transform to make it more easily understandable (at least for someone like me, who hasn't written a lot of SWC code). I also fixed a few bugs and edge cases. I brought over the tests from the transform in the Next.js and added a couple of them. For now, only the StripDataExports filter is used. A future PR will build on this and @ForsakenHarmony's link PR to actually implement SSR/SSG HMR.  Reviewing guide The crux of the change is the move (and refactor) of the next ssg transform from link to link. I also added the errors.rs and fixture.rs tests. I adapted fixture.rs to execute on the two transform filters: data exports and default export. Most of the tests in tests/ are copied from link. The changes I made are:   i. link: made this one symmetric for both strip data and strip default transforms.   ii. link wasn't supported before AFAIK.   iii. link similar to i.",1

We can then encode the chunk path and item id into the filename, and let next's stack tracing code handle the rest. This also fixes an off-by-one on the column.

This PR is an initial attempt to support mdx natively inside of turbopack. It uses mdxrs (link) internally to interop - compile - mdx inputs into renderable ecma outputs. PR creates a new type of asset MDXAsset, and then let its extension (.mdx) can be consumed by turbopack. Since mdx is a variant of ecma asset to be rendered, it requires to perform all of the ecma transforms in the current running turbopack session. But since its AST is not compatible to plain swc (or ecma), it also cannot be passed into existing ecmaassets. MDXAsset does interop for those, by creating a virtualasset for the ecma once mdx is compiled into plain ecma. This might not be feasible appoarch and requires different way to chain asset types, something I'd like to address in this PR. I guess this will be needed for other types of assets in a long run - where input is not an ecma but requires ecma transforms (i.e vue, ng templates).",0

This is, well, complicated. As you'll see in the comments, we have an ""inert"" asset that acts as a placeholder until the module chunking algorithm gives us access to a ChunkingContextVc. It's unfortunately not available when we're doing the file parsing, but we can insert a reference to that inert asset. That inert asset will eventually create a UrlAssetChunk instance, and with that we can finally generate the correct output path for the URL referenced file. We actually discussed whether this could use a StaticAsset/StaticModuleAsset (a StaticAsset can be inserted at parse time), but it turns out that won't give us the necessary control to generate the final URL instance. A StaticModuleAsset always outputs an absolute path as it's default export, and that just won't work when we're trying to reference the file in node SSR. Fixes WEB-142.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path. I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement module support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path. I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement module support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path. I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement module support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in ChunkGroup_index ('/_a8a837.js'), ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in ChunkGroup_async ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async. But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk, so this PR deleted the reference between ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async, makes the graph be like this: And makes chunks in ChunkGroup_async to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'.",1

(You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) Once we're in composable turbo.json land this will either: - Do exactly what you want it to do. (Your execution directory will find up to the closest turbo.json which is the correct composition entry point. Will be the majority of use-cases and matches the Turborepo recommendations.) - Fail, and have no content contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) - Fail, and have the wrong values contributing to the key for the incremental cache. (You ran your command from a place where you ""miss"" the correct turbo.json when trying to find up. This failure is undetectable.) This last state needs the most explanation. When this occurs we will be adding a random set of environment variables to the cache key—and not necessarily the ones that matter. This will occur if process.cwd() does not represent the correct place in the file system to start walking to find turbo.json files. When this happens the ESLint incremental cache will be keyed on the wrong thing and won't necessarily invalidate for the correct changes, and will possibly invalidate for unrelated changes. The workaround here would be to modify the .eslintrc.js file in question to not use ""extends"": [""turbo""] and look like the following: js {   ""plugins"": [""turbo""],   ""rules"": {     ""turbo/no-undeclared-env-vars"": [       ""error"",       {         ""turboConfig"": require(""path/to/turbo.json"")       }     ]   } } We can't notify users of this failure which makes it especially rough.",0

This key should be set when the task starts a long-running process that does not exit (such as a dev server or --watch mode for a test runner). When this key is set, turbo will ensure that no other tasks can dependsOn this task. Previously, if Task A depended on a ""persistent"" Task B, Task A would never run, because Task B never exited. This caused a lot of confusion, and our advice was to use the --parallel flag, which meant that all topological ordering was thrown out the window. After this change, turbo will detect this configuration and throw an error. After talking with users, we realized that there isn't really a need to topologically order long-running tasks, so instead of allowing configuration to create this ordering, (and then bypassing it with --parallel), we prevent you from configuring this ordering in the first place!

It also reworks the END_OF_OPERATION logic to avoid hard coding a single end of operation marker (they're now unique per pool), and allow multiple kinds of operation events (Step, Success, Error). This is not a particularly good implementation for this. A better implementation would proxy the request from the client to the Node.js server in a more direct manner. We also need a way to tell turbo tasks ""don't bother ever caching this"", as right now every single API request and result will still be cached, even if we know they will never be used again. Finally, we should communicate with Node.js processes via a better mechanism than stdout. I made some progress on a prototype for using link with NAPI a while back, which I'd like to pick up some time after conf. However, it seems to work well enough for now, so yay.

It works by a Introspectable trait which can be implemented by anything we want to allow the user to inspect. In future the in browser UI should offer a nice UI to explore your application. In future we probably also want to add some metrics to the Introspectable trait, e. g. to report size of an asset. This UI is very basic currently, but that works for debugging:",1
1949,TODO,0.6947536,  {,"Ported from link Partially addresses link. Resolves link. This inserts code to throw an error at runtime when an unresolvable reference is encountered, at its time of import. This means that code referencing symbols from the import is unreachable. Additionally, I modeled this after what webpack currently does, and the same error-generating expression is generated at each site the symbol is referenced. Other options include: Continue leaving undefined in their place, as they are not reachable anyway and this won't impact the running app. Looks clearly wrong, even if it is never run Leave behind the original identifier name (i.e. the given name of the default import or named imports) Don't generate any further code past the import site This feels clean, but I'm guessing it might be surprising to folks grepping in generated bundles not to find their original code there (even if it would never be run with a failing resolution).

In order to surface other potential errors while waiting on CSS modules implementation, I've implemented a Proxy-based shim that will always return a string whenever a CSS module export object is indexed. There are known issues with this implementation: Only .module.css files should be considered CSS modules and EcmascriptChunkPlaceable; Could have used embed_file!

The latter is closer to how include_*! works, but it has a couple of issues: * Since file! returns a path relative to the workspace, it requires knowing the full path to the workspace. However, this is undefined when the package is compiled from outside of the workspace (e.g. as a dependency of another package). * Procedural macros don't have access to the path of the file where they were originally invoked (although we could get it with #[feature(proc_macro_span)]), which means that an embed_dir macro would not be able to be relative to the invoker file anyway. So this makes things more consistent for such a (to be implemented) macro.",1

This alone doesn't solve my issue with logging. No matter what changes I've tried to the backend (children scopes crawling, collating into a CountHashSet during reads (because items could be very negative but still have a single positive elsewhere stack)), I constantly see the same message over and over. I now think it's because the turbopack-dev-server is spawning new root tasks everytime it receives a network request. That root task is completely divorced from prior executions, so every time we've un-emitted, it's just re-emitted during the computation of the new root task's subtasks. I think we need to invert the network-handler -> turbo-tasks nesting to be turbo-tasks -> network-handler, with a persistent root task.",0

This will help to dedupe different versions of packages, also potentially avoid conflicts if forgot to bump up specific versions. In this pr only touches swc_core, which is a base dependency we use in several place. One another benefit for this is bump up PR can be lot more simplified, only need to update single Cargo.toml when we bump up. Note rust-toolchain has updated to use nightly version after 1.64.0 to enable this.",0

This is required as workspace dependencies don't appear in packages in the pnpm lockfile format. Taking a quick look at the npm lockfile format, this additional information will be helpful when implementing npm prune so it seems sensible to make this addition. The current implementation of copying dependency patches copies all patches instead of those that are strictly necessary. This was done due to the fact that pnpm duplicates patch info in package.json and in order to only copy the necessary patches we would first need to learn how to prune package.json. This should be done in the future, but is outside of the scope of this fix. fix pruning of importers fix copy patches during pruning force paths to use unix style paths for pnpm workspace packages address review feedback, fixup path types",0

We expect that the source map will be requested from the base asset's path appended with a .map, eg foo.js -> foo.js.map are paired. I've chosen to implement the source maps using a ""sectioned"" source map (née index map). This is by far the most efficient way to concatenate the source maps for multiple source files together, because it doesn't require us to modify the source map of an individual section at all. Coupled with the (IMHO) subpar API provided by the sourcemap crate, this is essentially the only good choice (we could VLQ encode -> stringify -> parse -> VLQ decode -> adjust -> VLQ encode -> stringify, but that's gotta be slower…). While unusual in the dev ecosystem, it's fully supported by all the browsers and we're targeting a dev server as the initial use case, so it works out well. This also introduces a CodeBuilder, which allows us to concatenate real source files (with source maps) with injected runtime code, preserving the offset positions for the source maps.

And then a request (remote mutation) is started via module and the response will be written to the cache. If that request fails, the original result will be rolled back safely so the optimistic value will be gone. And after all those finish, a revalidation will start to fetch the latest value. This is extremely helpful for building the optimistic UI pattern. You can do the same for the global module, just remember to pass the key. Also, the current module APIs stay unchanged so module works the same. Here's an example: link. link module Support SWR now has module exported for bundlers that prefer this format. This doesn’t break environments that don’t support module. An alternative module and CJS bundle are also published. You can read more about ES modules here.

2366,improve error handling in update stream (#4705),0.7395295,Improved error messages,"This PR contains the following updates: | Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence | |---|---|---|---|---|---| | esbuild | ^0.14.38 -> ^0.15.0 |  |  |  |  | Release Notes evanw/esbuild module Compare Source   Add module to allow esbuild to never terminate (#​1511, #​1885) Currently using esbuild's watch mode via module from the CLI will stop watching if stdin is closed. The rationale is that stdin is automatically closed by the OS when the parent process exits, so stopping watch mode when stdin is closed ensures that esbuild's watch mode doesn't keep running forever after the parent process has been closed. For example, it would be bad if you wrote a shell script that did module to run esbuild's watch mode in the background, and every time you run the script it creates a new module process that runs forever. However, there are cases when it makes sense for esbuild's watch mode to never exit. One such case is within a short-lived VM where the lifetime of all processes inside the VM is expected to be the lifetime of the VM. Previously you could easily do this by piping the output of a long-lived command into esbuild's stdin such as module. However, this possibility often doesn't occur to people, and it also doesn't work on Windows. People also sometimes attempt to keep esbuild open by piping an infinite stream of data to esbuild such as with module where module path segment is ignored). So module maps to the underlying file module. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system. module   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.   These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.   module Compare Source This release contains backwards-incompatible changes. Since esbuild is before version 1.0.0, these changes have been released as a new minor version to reflect this (as recommended by npm). You should either be pinning the exact version of module in your module file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as module. See the documentation about semver for more information.   Implement the Yarn Plug'n'Play module resolution algorithm (#​154, #​237, #​1263, #​2451) Node comes with a package manager called npm, which installs packages into a module folder. Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within module, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called Yarn. While Yarn can install packages using module, it also offers a different package installation strategy called Plug'n'Play, which is often shortened to ""PnP"" (not to be confused with pnpm, which is an entirely different unrelated package manager). Plug'n'Play installs packages as module files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read module actually automatically extracts module from module at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system. Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the module plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a module file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside module files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API). With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a module, module, or module file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: link/. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need module anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as module and module in module files within module files should now be respected. Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find module helpful.

My first reaction was to try to minimize the lifetime of the WriteGuard in add_to_scope_internal_shallow to avoid contention. However, it's unclear whether it's lock contention that's causing the slowdown, or if it's just the locking/unlocking mechanism of std::sync::RwLock itself. Instead, I switched to parking_lot::RwLock, and instantly noticed great improvements.

It also  Notable changes:  - Context now stores the lockfile interface instead of a yarn specific lockfile  - PackageJson now only stores the package names as they appear in the lockfile, these will be mapped to their entries when the pruned lockfile is created  - The initial implementation would cache the processed version of the yarn lockfile and attempt to use it. I did some light testing and I don't think this has a significant perf hit since the processing is straightforward. From my understanding of Golang I think having Lockfile as an interface makes sense since each package manager has a different data layout for their lockfile e.g. pnpm has 6 top level entries and yarn's top level entries are the package entries themselves. Testing: The e2e tests cover yarn prune, but I also tested that prune produces the an identical lockfile before and after these changes on a repo created with npx create-turbo.",1

I believe the most optimized solution is to run the turbo prune before the docker build on the machine that runs the docker build and set the out directory as the docker build context.

For now, in order for React Refresh to be enabled, you'll need the @next/react-refresh-utils package to be resolveable: yarn add @next/react-refresh-utils in your app folder. Depends on #266  Integrated both HMR-and-React-Refresh-specific logic directly into the ES chunks' runtime. Webpack has more complex setup here, but for now this makes the logic much more easy to follow since everything is in one place. I have yet to implement the ""dependencies"" signature for hot.accept/hot.dispose, since React Refresh does not depend on them. We'll have to see if they're even used in the wild or if we should deprecate them. Only implemented the module API, not the management API. We apply all updates as soon as we receive them. Added support for ""runtime entries"" to ES chunks. These are assets that will be executed before the main entry of an ES chunk. They'll be useful for polyfills in the future, but for now they're here to evaluate the react refresh runtime before any module is instantiated. Next steps for HMR: * Implement CSS HMR * Implement (or decide to deprecate) the dependencies form of hot.accept/hot.dispose * Clean up runtime.js some more: switch to TypeScript, split into multiple files, etc. It'd be nice if all of this could be done at compile time, but how to achieve this is unclear at the moment.

2471,release(turborepo): 1.9.0-canary.2 (#4496),0.784418,release(turborepo): 1.8.7-canary.0 by @github-actions in link,"This implements snapshot testing, which writes all chunks to the filesystem. Hopefully these'll be a little quicker to test than the evaluation tests, which require us to spin up a browser to execute. The snapshots will detect if a file is expected (in the output dir) but it's not output by turbopack, if a file is output but was not expected, or if the contents has changed. It also supports a TURBOPACK_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 env, which will pass all tests, update all files to the latest outputs, and delete any files that shouldn't exist. The test structure follows a //input directory structure. Eg, large-feature-group └── explicit-feature     ├── input     │   └── index.js     │   └── any-other-files...     │   └── node_modules/...     └── output         └── snapshot_large_feature_group_explicit_feature_input_index.js         └── snapshot_large_feature_group_explicit_feature_input_node_modules_foo_index.js.js The //output is the output chunks we expect turbopack to generate. A few things are still left todo: - Diffing of the files isn't supported, which would be very helpful for finding changes. - I didn't handle static assets, and CSS could be broken. - It only supports index.js as the entry point, but we should support many entrypoints (and different filenames and extensions) via an options.json. - We only perform Browser transformations, but we should support any via an options.json. - I don't know if a nested directory structure is possible for output chunks, so it only supports output/* files.",1

This means two paths might conflict when on a case-sensitive filesystem. It uses an array of Invalidators now Move the next-dev bootstrapping logic out of the run_once scope (which is not updated when invalidations occur). Instead it's executed inside the request handling resp. update stream where changes can be handled. TransientValue was not an Value type actually. This fixes that. Adds a new TransientInstance wrapper to pass transient by reference. strongly_consistent was broken when using nested TaskScopes. This fixes that.,1

I'm opening this early to get thoughts from folks re: the direction of the design and implementation. Fixes #204  Currently it: * Discovers integration test fixtures from the filesystem. Right now these are expected to be single files that get bundled and will eventually include assertions. This is powered by the test-generator crate, which allows us not to have to manually enumerate each case. We could consider using this for the node-file-trace tests as well. * Starts the dev server on a free port and opens a headless browser to its root. The browser control is implemented with the link crate, which expects Chrome or Chromium to already be available. Eventually it will: * [x] Implement a minimal test environment loaded in the browser so that assertions can be run there from bundled code. * [x] Report back the results of these assertions to rust, where we can pass/fail cargo tests with those results. In the future it could: * Possibly include snapshot-style tests to assert on transformed results. This could be in the form of fixture directories instead of files cc @jridgewell * Support expressing special configuration of turbopack in a fixture, possibly as another file in the fixture directory. * [x] ~Possibly support distributing tests to a pool of open browsers instead of opening and closing for each test.~ Test Plan: See next PRs",0

This causes the __metadata, version, and cache_key fields to be parsed as separate fields, when really the version and cache_key should be nested within __metadata.  This silently causes the yarn cache to miss on every dependency without throwing an error. Fixing this line drastically improves dependency install times for pruned workspaces when the cache exists. Additionally, turbo throws an error here when running a yarn workspaces focus my-app install afterwards due to the un-nested metadata: ERROR  yarn.lock: could not unmarshal lockfile: yaml: unmarshal errors: --   |   | line 5: cannot unmarshal !!int module into fs.LockfileEntry   |   | line 6: cannot unmarshal !!int module into fs.LockfileEntry Solution Because the yamlEncoder sets the indent to two, adding two spaces before each of the fields should make this valid syntax.

3050,Fix relative links on installing page (#3937),0.80043817,Fix relative links on installing page by @mehulkar in link,"Fixes link Issue Summary There were two main issues causing this: We're using generic filesystem function for the cache operations. These functions require a file mode for the source file, and a file mode for the destination file. We were setting the incorrect bit here causing all files to be restored from cache with one file mode.  When recursively walking files, the walk function we use seems to be calling the callback with the incorrect file mode (it's always 0) The Fix To fix this, I've made the file copying functions a bit less generalized (they no longer require a source mode, or a destination mode). Instead, they always use the mode of the source file for the destination file. I also pushed the logic of sourcing the source files mode into the Copy function, below where the incorrect mode was being returned from godirwalk. This makes these functions slightly less reusable, but for our purposes, this is what we need. We can always add back generalized versions in the future.",1

3166,Fix and add test for ignoring a macro field (#4869),0.4961022,fix(docs): remove empty array instruction (#3351) by @tknickman,"Added ""outputLogs"" To turbo.json This commit adds a new configuration option ""outputLogs"" which will be used to set the default value of the --output-logs run option. Refactored --output-logs Run Option This commit refactors the task log output to use the new util.TaskOutputModeand removes the LogMode type used previously. Added ""outputLog"" Tests Added ""outputLogs"" Documentation Simplified TaskOutputMode Constants Changed TaskOutputMode Into Enum This commit replaces the TaskOutputMode strings with an appropriate enum and related parsing. It now uses UnmarshalJSON to parse as well and so we can remove ValidateTurboJSON entirely. Moved ""outputLogs"" Config Into Pipeline This commit moves the root ""outputLogs"" configuration option into the pipeline config. It also renames it to ""outputMode"" to better reflect the nature of the option. Fixed Accidental Changes Removed More Unnecessary Changes After scrolling through all of the changed files in GitHub, I found other instances of unnecessary changes. Since this PR went through a few iterations, some things were left behind that weren't necessary. Added ""outputMode"" Parsing Test Refactored TaskOutputModeOverride Into TaskCache This removes the need to deal with strings outside of the ""--output-logs"" value handling. Added --output-logs Default Value Error Handling Mark TaskOutputModeOverride as optional in runcache.Opts.

Implementation notes that will need to be documented:  * Tasks run from the root are opt-in. That is, turbo.jsonmust have an entry for _root# to enable running that task at the root.  * _root is available in filters, so turbo run my-task --filter=_root will run _root#my-task.   * If an entry exists in turbo.json for _root#task, then turbo run task will also run that task for the root.  * There is some best-effort cycle detection in place. If the root package.json has ""build"": ""turbo run build"", then even after opting in, turbo run build --filter=_root will produce an error. This cycle detection can be circumvented with aliases or other indirection used to run turbo.  * For the purposes of changed files, any changed file in a repo that doesn't belong to another package is considered to belong to the root.    * Note that this could cause frequent runs of root tasks if they are triggered from git changes. With inputs specified, they should hit cache if nothing relevant has changed. Additional changes:  * e2e tests now include a root task  * a package task is now sufficient to mark a particular task as runnable by turbo. e.g. if you defined foo#my-task but not my-task in turbo.json, previously running turbo run my-task would be an error, now it will run foo#my-task.

A pretty-obvious bit of followup work is to move both package_json and turbo_json out of the fs package—they could be trivially refactored to never touch the file system (and possibly should be for testability reasons).",0

3476,Add clap macros for is_next_dev_command (#3073),0.4578159,add turbo_tasks State (#2935) by @sokra in link,"This PR is a proposal for how we can start to get a handle on the various kinds of paths that turbo uses. My goal is the following:  * Eventually ensure that an absolute, platform-dependent path is used any time we interact with the filesystem    * This will allow us to guarantee that we don't break --cwd, which is likely currently broken  * Eventually ensure that we can easily identify relative paths, both with respect to the monorepo root and to a particular package root  * Be incrementally adoptable. There is a huge amount of surface area to this change, so it's important to be able to tackle it a piece at a time  * Be auditable. The goal would be to eventually ban usage of path/filepath and a subset of os.* functions anywhere in the codebase outside path.go. It may even be possible to automate this in CI. Furthermore, entry points and exit points from our custom types (currently just AbsolutePath) are clearly marked, along with the intention of eventually migrating them, if appropriate (e.g. ToStringDuringMigration, UnsafeToAbsolutePath).  * New PRs that interact with the filesystem should use fs.AbsolutePath, even if they need to use one of the migration functions to facilitate that. Hopefully this will force both the submitter and reviewer to focus on ensuring that the new code will work properly with --cwd. I've done a few pieces of the migration to show what it would look like in the code base in a partially migrated state. path.go contains the AbsolutePath type, which ideally would be the sole way to interact with the filesystem. Please let me know what you think about the api and the migration overall.",0

3536,nextest: time out leaky check after 500ms (#3277),0.9471602,nextest: time out leaky check after 500ms (#3277) by @wbinnssmith,"This change checks for --color / --no-color as command-line arguments as a mechanism for forcing color in non-TTY situations, or forcing --no-color for TTY. Additionally, this change hooks into the FORCED_COLOR environment variable that is used by the supports-color npm package that is used by a variety of packages in the node ecosystem. The intention of this PR is to alleviate some of the concerns from Issue #897 by allowing users of turborepo to enable color output on CI runners such as Github Actions which support color output (as mentioned in the fatih/color documentation). With github actions and local builds are both running in color, then the cached output should be consistently in color, compared to the current situation where its a mix of color and non-color output with a remote shared between CI and users building interactively. The FORCED_COLOR environment variable is something that I find myself already setting when running turbo so that the streamed output is in color for the build and testing tools that I am running with it, so it seemed like a natural way to provide this argument without needing to modify the CLI parameters being passed to turbo. In the event multiple methods are being used, the precedence is: * isTTY or not (provided by fatih/color) * $NO_COLOR (if set, then color is disabled) * $FORCED_COLOR (""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""true"" will enable color, ""0"", or ""false"" will disable color) * --color/--no-color (the last argument wins if both exist)",1

It should no longer be necessary.  * Remove the test for --scope and --since implying --include-dependencies  * Add a new scheduler test that mimics the way run now behaves.  * Add a debugging profile for doing a dry run against the kitchen sink example. Future work includes being able to write a test in run_test.go to get the whole end-to-end graph build, but we don't quite have the infrastructure for that yet (also required for follow-on work to #911)  Note that this is technically a breaking change. Previously, if a depends on b, and the ""test"" task depends on ""^build"" the following would be true:  * turbo run test --scope=a would test a but not build b  * turbo run test --scope=a --include-dependencies would build b and test a AND b. With this change, turbo run test --scope=a will now build b and test a. The addition of tasks running for unselected packages is new. While this seems like more work being done, in practice I expect users to be able to move from the second example above to the first, ultimately resulting in less work being done: b#test will no longer need to run to get a#test to run.",0

But, we don't need c#build. We just need c#some-task, since that's what b#build depends on, and a doesn't really know anything about c directly, just via b. So, we instead just draw an edge to direct dependencies, and then let them sort out their own dependencies.

More specifically this removes the general check for yarn pnp and moves it into the prune command instead as this is the part that likely has remaining issues with pnp since nothing else that I'm aware of needs to know about node_modules. This PR builds off of #795, as otherwise you can't even run turbo to be able to hit the previous nodeLinker checks. Let me know if you would like me to change things around so that it is more explicitly enabling for the run task as opposed to enabling for all but prune.",1

I've done my best to infer what packages should be built in each scenario, but please verify. Also very happy to accept additions to that test. Possibly controversial change: To maintain backwards compatibility, specifying --since and --scope to turbo run will imply --include-dependencies. This means that using scope will generally cause all dependencies of the specified scopes to be built, although the cache will still be used so this may potentially be cheap.  Previously, this behavior was triggered when --scope and --since constraints produced packages to be built. In cases where they were both specified but one or both did not produce packages to be built, dependencies were not included.  With this change, the behavior will be consistent based on commandline flags and default to building dependencies. With an upcoming switch over to cobra for commandline parsing, we should be able to flag off building dependencies if the user requests it.",0

3776,fix(renovate): correct glob (#3006),0.87040484,fix(renovate): correct glob (#3006) by @tknickman in link,"Splitting this out of #802. I tried this first when attempting to fix my own build issues in that PR after discovering Issue #407 which suggested peerDependencies might be the problem. It wasn't enough to solve the build hangs with my project, but seems to have its own merits. If a package has a peer dependency but there is no corresponding devDependency, then it should be presumed that there are no build-time dependency on that package. For example, if there was code that would be executed by one of the scripts that tried to import from the peer package, this would generally speaking fail to run, because node would be unable to resolve the dependency unless another package was pulling it in and it got hoisted, etc. Workspace dependencies are kind of a special case in that they won't be hoisted and can be resolved by node, but if you were to ever move that package out of the monorepo then that same situation as above would fail to build. As a result, my impression is that for any use-case where peerDependencies need to be explicitly part of the dependency graph is actually just a missing dependency declaration bug where that package should actually be part of the dev deps. I have also changed the order in which dependencies, optionalDependencies, and devDependencies are selected to match the order that lerna uses for cases where the package shows up in multiple places. See: link The attached issues mentions making a flag to control this behavior, but given the reasoning above, I'm not sure if there is ever a situation where you would want to have a peer-dependency impact the dependency graph if its not also a regular or dev (or optional) dependency.

This way, and combining with the new npm run jsonschema script, it's possible to generate an Json schema file. I configured to the generated file be placed at docs/public/schema.json , so it can be requested from the url link. You can test how powerfull it is with in IDE autocompletion, intellisense and inline documentation. Try it out in your IDE by adding ""$schema"": ""./docs/public/schema.json"" It also updated all (that i saw :P) documentation examples to include the $schema property, this way, it will go by default for all Ctrl C/V users out there. But i still need to point out some things: As the jsonschema (Is that even a good name?) script is going to be ran a lot, may we add ts-json-schema-generator to the devDependencies group? In the root turbo.json file, i saw an env property, but it is not documented, should i add it or it just shouldn't be there? I am not a native english speaker, even that i mostly copy pasted the tsdocs in the schema.d.ts file, it is not perfect and it probably has some typos. That's it for now.
