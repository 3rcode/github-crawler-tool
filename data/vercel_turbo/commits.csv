1,Inline a constant so it's individualized to each task run (#4735),
2,Make sure that we only hash the env pairs. (#4708),"This corrects the hashing behavior for the global hash if there is an EnvMode specified. The struct now known as GlobalHashableInputs contains additional data that is not required to be present in the hash; particularly that envVars should be env.EnvironmentVariablePairs, not env.DetailedMap. This didn't result in user-facing bugs, but it results in unnecessarily partitioned caches when using env modes. We can't hash what is now known as GlobalHashableInputs directly, we must grab the components of it that we need, which this does for the (currently) two available hash formats."

13,feat: Use Rust Berry lockfile impl (#4684),"Description Built on top of #4629 Overview of changes: - ~~Change subgraph so we calculate workspace's closure in parallel in a similar manner to Go~~ This had to get reverted, it appears that rayon was causing compilation issues on linux  - npm_subgraph -> subgraph makes this FFI call generic - Addition of an optional resolutions map to the subgraph and transitive_closure, this is only used by Berry. In the ideal world this would be all of the root package.json, but serializing all of that via protobuf is overkill since berry is the only lockfile that needs that info and we only use that field. - Addition of patches FFI function, this wasn't needed before as NPM doesn't have patch files encoded in the lockfile - Addition of global_changes FFI function, previously for NPM we were just doing this in Go since there were just two fields we needed to check and parsing JSON is cheap. - Switches lockfile usage of berry from the Go implementation to the Rust one introduced in #4589 Reviewer notes: - The passing of the optional resolutions map is very icky and one off, but this is the only lockfile the requires additional information to properly parse. Once the package graph is squarely in Rust land this should go back to being more generic. This will finally close out #2791 Testing Instructions Added a new integration test that uses resolutions. This integration test invokes the new patches FFI call. For a full test of the new resolution feature, clone and follow the instructions in the repro The lockfile_aware_caching integration tests all hit the new global_changes FFI callsite and provide test coverage.

28,chore: move lockfile ffi boundary (#4629),"Description In order to avoid Go holding onto memory that's been allocated by Rust we parse the lockfile each time we need to make a lockfile call. This worked fine for the npm implementation as we just needed parse the JSON and it was usable, but Berry requires a lot more work/allocations that makes this strategy unfeasible. A quick sketch of the changes in this PR: - Moves the traversal of the lockfile to be the final step of building the package graph  - We now calculate all of the closures of all workspaces at once - Rust FFI now takes the package manager string to select the lockfile implementation. This is a quick prefactor to prepare for hooking up the berry lockfile Reviewer notes: - Each commit can be reviewed on it's own, the first commit ended up getting reverted down the stack so it can be skipped.

Context: https://vercel.slack.com/archives/C03EWR7LGEN/p1681789689115509 Currently all of the ecma transforms are explicitly listed under EcmaInputTransform in turbopack-ecmascript. This makes enum verbose, we have to manually expand it each time adding new transform, as well as turbopack-ecmascript gets larger to contain all of the 3rd party transforms by default. PR extracts non-core transforms into a new crate, named as ecmascript-plugins then utilize EcmaInputTransform::Custom to invoke transforms instead. EcmaInputTransform::Custom is renamed to EcmaInputTransform::Plugin as well. Goal is extracting all of 3rd party / non-core transforms. This also reduces multiple steps to construct option value between caller (next-*) to actual transform (swcOptions). https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/48671 have corresponding next.js changes."
34,add noop refresh runtime to prevent errors after module execution (#4701),Description We add some noop handlers to make sure code won't throw errors when something tries to access the refresh runtime outside the initial module execution next.js does this here https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/f12aa35b0d85aa28223e06ee6f6a98247262815e/packages/react-refresh-utils/ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin.ts#L16-L30 I'm not 100% sure this is the correct fix fix WEB-823

43,Daemon server rust port (#4306),"Description This ports the daemon server to rust, leaving only run an prune in go-land. This needs some polish but I would like to get some feedback now. I have also added a flag for running the grpc server over http instead, which is useful for debugging. It has support for reflection, so can be used via postman or grpcurl. For code reviews, it should be ok to go in commit-order. Outstanding parts:  [x] incomplete tests in glob watch [x] error handling for watch errors [ ] logging / log rotation  Out of scope (for now):  startup performance pass  Testing Instructions This is a drop-in replacement for the go server, so turbo run in any repo should work identically."

47,feat: Add rust implementation of Yarn3+ lockfile (#4589),"Description Adds a new Berry lockfile implementation that correctly handles resolutions. See the description of #2019 for an overview of the berry lockfile format. Note for reviewers: - I suggest reviewing identifiers.rs first as Ident, Descriptor, and Locator are the building blocks for most of the lockfile logic - We cannot use serde_yaml for serialization as berry expects some strings to be quoted that are not necessarily required to be quoted by the YAML spec. - The underlying lockfile data is passed into the struct that contains the lockfile logic, this allows us to borrow from the data when building up the internal data structures. Down the road this could be changed to use Pin if this proves to be painful from an ergonomics perspective Testing Instructions Ported existing unit tests and added new ones for the resolutions logic. The PR that switches this Rust impl on will include instructions on how to do e2e testing.  Co-authored-by: Alexander Lyon arlyon@me.com"

This also means we may actually be able to turn on remote caching in GitHub CI and make it faster. The important caveat is that we have to use a published version of turbo to kick off test runs. I think this is generally a good thing because it means we use what our customers use and we become real customers of our own tool.

Currently turbopack in next-swc applies all of moduleoptionscontext into any kind of internal assets. Current available contextcondition (ContextCondition::InDirectory) does not gives enough context to determine where it comes from, makes non trivial to determine if given context need to be treated differently. ~I'm trying to workaround by supplying addtional context for the filesystemkind, and caller can use it for creating a new contextcondition. In case of turbopack, I assume any embedded assets in the binary won't be an external / user's. Next-swc will assign a new condition like https://github.com/vercel/next.js/compare/canary...client-context-embedded-fs#diff-92086db0c6bc192f76dab5d612a562df8fddffea05244c1c00d58e7288879e11R213-R214.~ ~Still bit unsure if this is a legit apporach or would be better way to go.

101,add included metadata to chunks to allow deduplicate chunk loads at runtime (#4488),Description Chunk loading is now more than just a single chunk filepath. It might consist of additional metadata which tells the chunk loading logic the entry modules included in this chunk. This allows the runtime logic to avoid loading chunks when all entry modules are already loaded. This means loading the same chunk from multiple sources (with different available modules) will only trigger a single load and so avoids transferring more code than needed. This is especially relevant in app dir where every client component is considers as separate chunk loading. next.js: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/48025

103,fix: better support for pnpm aliases (#4555),"Description This is a follow up to #4541 that fixes the underlying issue. We now will attempt to return the extracted version instead of the full key when we encounter one. A quick explanation for how this happened is that when pnpm aliases are used the resolved version in the lockfile will be the full lockfile key instead of a version since the name won't match the specifier (e.g. ""foo: npm:bar@^1.0.0"" will have a version of /bar/1.0.0 instead of just 1.0.0). This is all fine unless an external dependency also depends on bar@1.0.0 then we get a dependency of Package{Key: ""/bar/1.0.0"", Version: ""1.0.0""} when going through the external dependency where we would get Package{Key: ""/bar/1.0.0"", Version: ""/bar/1.0.0""} going through the workspace with the alias. Testing Instructions Updated the unit test added in the initial PR to reflect that we're no longer getting a package with a version that's actually a lockfile key. This change also changes the test for pnpm overrides, but this change is more correct as we're now only returning the version. I also tested that the changes don't trigger the repro that was provided in #3638"

Currently while there are mdx / mdxRs config, both shares same transform (mdxrs).

ChunkGroupVc previously took care of:   a. optimizing chunks; b. adding additional chunks, such as the ""evaluate"" chunk, which evaluates runtime entries. Both of these use cases are a concern of the chunking context (i.e. it would differ between dev and build), hence they're now handled by the chunking context. Move the chunk list registration logic into a different chunk. The chunk list was previously a bit leaky as it required the Next.js code to instantiate it manually. There were also a bunch of other instantiations in the code which differed ever so slightly. The chunk list registration code is now part of a separate chunk, which is only added by the dev chunking context.  Testing Instructions Snapshots + Next dev tests + Manual tests fix WEB-822"
146,Deprecate THASH. (#4526),"This PR deprecates the use of THASH for cache partitioning.  The search string is .*THASH.* and can match things like GITHASH. Inferring env var inclusion based upon arbitrary substring inclusion regardless of position is too broad. (Should have been ^THASH_.+.) Squatting on an env var string not scoped to ^TURBO_.+ is (at least) not polite to the rest of the ecosystem. Using this feature makes it more-difficult to share caches across machines and create reproducible builds. Residual THASH variables from earlier arbitrary configuration can unnecessarily partition the cache. The interaction between this feature and ""strict"" environment variable mode introduces complexity where a user can't easily reason about the behavior. Should the THASH variable be included into the global hash if unspecified? Should the THASH variable pushed into the execution environment?  The original goal of this feature is to be able to quickly and dynamically change the hash key for a run. I find that the implicit nature is anathema to our goals. Previous use cases and recommendations: - Compare cache artifacts across multiple runs: use run summary or --cache-dir. - Make sure everything runs: use --force. - SOMETHING_THASH=foo turbo run build is just a hardcoded env var. Add it to turbo.json under globalEnv instead.  Co-authored-by: Mehul Kar mehul.kar@vercel.com"

There are also many new features, for example, **HTTP2 support** is finally live! :globe_with_meridians:  *If you find Got useful, you might want to [sponsor the Got maintainers](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got?sponsor=1).*  ***  #### Breaking changes  ##### Removed support for `electron.net`  Due to the inconsistencies between the Electron's `net` module and the Node.js `http` module, we have decided to officially drop support for it. Therefore, the `useElectronNet` option has been removed.  You'll still be able to use Got in the Electron main process and in the renderer process through the `electron.remote` module or if you use Node.js shims.  ##### The Pagination API is now stable  We haven't seen any bugs yet, so please give it a try! If you want to leave some feedback, you can do it [here](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1052). Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!  ```diff  { -    _pagination: {...} +    pagination: {...}  } ```  ##### API  - The `options.encoding` behavior has been reverted back to the Got 9 behavior.     In other words, the options is only meant for the Got promise API. To set the encoding for streams, simply call `stream.setEncoding(encoding)`.  ```diff -got.stream('https://sindresorhus.com', {encoding: 'base64'}); +got.stream('https://sindresorhus.com').setEncoding('base64');  // Promises stay untouched await got('https://sindresorhus.com', {encoding: 'base64'}); ```  - The error name `GotError` has been renamed to `RequestError` for better readability and to comply with the documentation.  ```diff -const {GotError} = require('got'); +const {RequestError} = require('got'); ```  - The `agent` option now accepts **only an object** with `http`, `https` and `http2` properties. While the `http` and `https` properties accept native `http(s).Agent` instances, the `http2` property must be an instance of [`http2wrapper.Agent`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/http2-wrapper#new-http2agentoptions) or be undefined.  ```diff { -    agent: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}) }  { +    agent: { +        http: new http.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        https: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        http2: new http2wrapper.Agent() +    } } ```  - The `dnsCache` option is now set to a default instance of [`CacheableLookup`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup). It cannot be a `Map`-like instance anymore. The underlying [`cacheable-lookup`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup) package has received many improvements, for example, it has received `hosts` file support! Additionally, the `cacheAdapter` option has been renamed to `cache`. Note that it's no longer passed to [Keyv](https://togithub.com/lukechilds/keyv), so you need to pass a Keyv instance it if you want to save the data for later.  ```diff { -    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ -        cacheAdapter: new Map() -    }) }  { +    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ +        cache: new Keyv({ +            cacheAdapter: new Map() +        }) +    }) }  // Default:  {     dnsCache: new CacheableLookup() } ```  - Errors thrown in `init` hooks will be converted to instances of `RequestError`. `RequestError`s provide much more useful information, for example, you can access the Got options (through `error.options`), which is very useful when debugging.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     try {         await got('https://sindresorhus.com', {             hooks: {                 init: [                     options => {                         if (!options.context) {                             throw new Error('You need to pass a `context` option');                         }                     }                 ]             }         });     } catch (error) {         console.log(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);         console.log('Here are the options:', error.options);     } })(); ```  - The options passed in an `init` hook may not have a `url` property. To modify the request URL you should use a `beforeRequest` hook instead.  ```diff {     hooks: { -        init: [ +        beforeRequest: [             options => {                 options.url = 'https://sindresorhus.com';             }         ]     } } ```  Note that this example shows a simple use case. In more complicated algorithms, you need to split the `init` hook into another `init` hook and a `beforeRequest` hook.  - The `error.request` property is no longer a `ClientRequest` instance. Instead, it gives a Got stream, which provides a set of useful properties.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     try {         await got('https://sindresorhus.com/notfound');     } catch (error) {         console.log(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);         console.log('Download progress:', error.request.downloadProgress);     } })(); ```  ##### Renamed TypeScript types  Some of the TypeScript types have been renamed to improve the readability:    Old type New type   ResponseObject Response   Defaults InstanceDefaults   DefaultOptions Defaults   DefaultRetryOptions RequiredRetryOptions   GotOptions Options   GotRequestMethod GotRequestFunction    ##### Other  -   Now requires Node.js 10.19 or later.  #### Enhancements  HTTP2 support is here! Excited? Yay! Unfortunately, it's off by default to make the migration smoother. Many Got users have set up their own Agents and we didn't want to break them. But fear no more, it will come enabled by default in Got 12.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     const response = await got('https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/anything', {http2: true});     console.log(response.socket.alpnProtocol);     //=> 'h2' })(); ```  1. The `merge` function is slow ([#‚Äã1016](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1016)) 2. Use `error.code` instead of `error.message` to compare errors ([#‚Äã981](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/981)) 3. Pass error thrown in the `init` hook to `beforeError` hook ([#‚Äã929](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/929)) 4.

Spaces should be normalized as `+` in query strings ([#‚Äã1113](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1113)) 6. Modify response headers while using `got.stream(...)` ([#‚Äã1129](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1129)) 7. Make `error.request` a Got stream ([`af0b147`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/commit/af0b1472abf48a6c5491dcb36a1d8863c5227fb3)).  #### Known bugs  1. When some errors occur, the `timings` may indicate that the request was successful although it failed. 2. When some errors occur, the `downloadProgress` object may show incorrect data.  #### Bug fixes  1. Requests to UNIX sockets are missing query strings ([#‚Äã1036](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1036)) 2. `beforeRequest` hooks aren't called on redirects ([#‚Äã994](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/994)) 3. Errors are swallowed when using `stream.pipeline(got.stream(...), ...)` ([#‚Äã1026](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1026)) 4. Cannot use the `cache` along with the `body` option ([#‚Äã1021](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1021)) 5. Got doesn't throw on leading slashes ([#‚Äã1057](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1057)) 6. Got throws when passing already frozen options ([#‚Äã1050](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1050)) 7. Cannot type Got options properly due to missing types ([#‚Äã954](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/954)) 8. `got.mergeOptions(...)` doesn't merge `URLSearchParams` instances ([#‚Äã1011](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1011)) 9. The `authorization` header is leaking ([#‚Äã1090](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1090)) 10. Pagination should ignore the `resolveBodyOnly` option ([#‚Äã1140](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1140)) 11. Cannot reuse user-provided options ([#‚Äã1118](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1118)) 12. Broken with Node.js ‚â• 13.10.0 ([#‚Äã1107](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1107)) 13. Cache is not decompressed ([#‚Äã1158](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1158)) 14. `beforeRetry` hooks are missing `options.context` ([#‚Äã1141](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1141)) 15. `promise.json()` doesn't throw `ParseError` ([#‚Äã1069](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1069)) 16.

192,ChunkingContext refactor pt. 1 (#4397),"Next.js side: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47693 Description This is part one of a larger ChunkingContext refactor. In this episode, we: 1. Move the runtime and evaluation code off of the entry JS chunk and into a dedicated chunk. This means that, within a chunk group, instead of having one chunk that contains modules + runtime code and chunks that only contain modules, we'll have chunks that only contain modules and one chunk that only contains runtime code. 2. Start a larger enterprise of differentiating between ""intermediate"" chunks (ChunkVcs), and ""output"" chunks (raw AssetVcs). Before, we used EcmascriptChunkVcs to represent both intermediate chunks that would never actually be created (optimized away) AND final chunks that would be served or written to disk. Now, EcmascriptChunkVcs are only intermediate assets, and DevEcmascriptChunkVcs are the final chunks. 3. Move a few modules from turbopack-core to turbopack-dev, as their existence (or the implementation) is only meaningful in a dev context (ChunkList and Manifest*, the latter of which depends on the chunk list for now). Things left to figure out: 1. What does the Chunk trait represent here? We no longer use .chunking_context(), and .path() is redundant with Asset::path. However, it no longer makes sense for Chunks to be Assets as their content is determined by the chunking context. Should we have two traits, one for intermediate chunks and one for output chunks? 2. Should EvalutatedEntryVc just be ChunkableAssetVc? We don't need all of the trait methods of either, just an ident and a way to convert to a chunk. The Chunk trait could look like this: rust trait Chunk {   fn ident(&self) -> IdentVc;   fn parallel_chunks(&self) -> ChunksVc;   fn references(&self) -> AssetReferencesVc; } Things that will happen in the next part(s): 1. The ChunkGroupVc::evaluated logic will move into turbopack-dev, as it doesn't make sense in a build context. This will essentially make ChunkGroupVc obsolete: the only thing we need it to do is to compute all parallel chunks, but I'm thinking this should be a method on the Chunk trait instead. Things I'll leave for future refactors: * Figure out the whole Input, Intermediate, and Output asset story. Testing Instructions Snapshots + Next integration tests fix WEB-815 (link)"

228,Implement Streaming Static/Proxy Rendering (#4329),"Description Implements streaming rendering for static/proxy renders (I don't know why they're called static or proxy‚Ä¶) using an initial Headers message, N BodyChunk messages, and a final BodyEnd message. Updating proxy rendering was very easy. It already implemented separate messages for header and body, but it buffered the full body before sending the full contents. But static rendering was a little more difficult, it has multiple paths that are immediately ready with a full body that I didn't want to break apart. So I kept the Response message for a full response that transforms into a ContentSourceContent::Static, and implemented a new enum type for streaming responses into a ContentSourceContent::HttpProxy. These is some weirdness with different data types on the headers field of a ContentSourceContent::Static's StaticContent and a ContentSourceContent::HttpProxy's ProxyResultVc. One is a HeaderListVc and the other is a Vec<(String, String)> (and really should be a HeadersList), but I'm leaving this for a follow up.

271,fix error handling and hanging problems (#4324),"Description  fix hanging tasks when recomputing cells fix inactive tasks when using streams fix fatal error handling for node.js evaluation  We need to ensure that Vc reads and connected Tasks are correctly handled in when producing streams. It's important that the Tasks are connected to something that is active when consumers read from the stream. Also Vc reads need to invalidate the stream and cause the production of a new stream. That was not handled correctly before. Now we use a child task to produce the stream that is active as part of the function that returns the stream. We also use a little hack to update the stream in the parent task when the child task is invalidated. It's a bit hacky, but eventually this kind of logic should probably move into turbo_tasks as part of some streaming concept.

273,Bump rustc version. (#4331),The build issues appear to be related to the rustc version. Rust is in the process of attempting to land llvm@16 which was released on March 18 (depending on where you stand in the world). I've bisected the release versions and confirmed that nightly-2023-03-21 is the last working release‚Äî coincidentally the version from the day we ran the 1.8.5 release. For now I'm hardcoding that into our release process; I have not done any further investigation of the actual root cause which will enable us to update past nightly-2023-03-21. We will need to do that at some point in order to make sure we don't lose the ability to release.
274,fix: make turbo command regex stricter (#4325),"Description With #4223, we started checking and throwing on commands that look like they invoke turbo. The regex is fairly permissive and would match any command that contained a path that ended in turbo e.g. rm ~/.turbo would get marked as invoking turbo. This PR restricts the regex so it only matches commands that contain turbo surrounded by whitespace. This means that we now won't throw if the user directly invokes turbo via a path e.g. ./node_modules/turbo/bin/turbo. I think this is the correct tradeoff as it's much more likely a user will invoke turbo via either turbo foo or pnpm turbo foo. Another possibility would be to attempt parse the scripts and do more exact analysis, but to do this and correctly handle Windows would be fun. Testing Instructions See new unit tests"

281,Implement node eval streaming (#4251),"Description This implements streaming Node evaluation using an fun generic Stream<T>, usable within any Vc (I'm kinda surprised it works). Think of it a bit like a DuplexStream, it implements both a reader (that can be streaming read with the Stream trait) and a writer (that can be sent cross threads). As new values are written to the stream, any readers get woken up to receive the next value. Included as part of this is a rework of our ""bytes"" implementations, extracting some logic into a new turbo-tasks-bytes crate. Eventually, Rope should also move out of turbo-tasks-fs into this crate. BytesValue are cheaply clonable (they're just a wrapper around bytes::Bytes), making them a perfect low-level type to hold the data being sent between processes and threads. They're also easy to convert to and from a real Bytes, so that they can be streamed into our hyper::Server.

284,feat: port npm lockfile to Rust (#3632),"Adds a Rust port of the npm lockfile implementation only used when GO_TAG=rust is set. Notes: - The crawling of the lockfile graph is done in the language of the lockfile impl to avoid incurring ffi overhead for every transitive dependency. This change requires moving this function into the lockfile package instead of context in Go (this is probably where it should've belonged all along) - We explicitly make an ffi function in Rust for each lockfile implementation. This adds boilerplate, but as this boundary should be short lived (only around until package graph gets moved into Rust) this is acceptable instead of coming up with a more generic solution. - If we stick with passing the lockfile contents for other implementations then we will be able to share the protobuf message definitions  Co-authored-by: Alexander Lyon arlyon@me.com"

291,chore(release): add new packages to publish flow (#4271),
292,Refactor ES chunk evaluate logic into a Runtime trait (#4141),"Description This refactors the EcmaScript chunk evaluate segment logic into a separate EcmascriptChunkRuntime trait. ChunkingContext implementors can now optionally implement the EcmascriptChunkContext trait (which already existed before as a struct). This trait has two additional methods: * EcmascriptChunkContext::ecmascript_runtime() -> Creates a ES runtime that only registers chunks' contents * EcmascriptChunkContext::evaluated_ecmascript_runtime() -> Creates an ES runtime that registers chunks' contents and evaluates its entries This is important because we are going to start having more than one runtime evaluation logic with next build (and ncc and any future bundler-specific work). In the future, this could even be used to have non-Ecmascript runtimes. Also fixes WEB-688 PR for the Next.js side: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47116 TODO   [x] ~~I need to ensure that waitForChunksToLoad works as expected on first load and does not re-create requests to JS and CSS chunks that are already being loaded.~~   [x] ~~Looks like there's a hashing problem (module ident perhaps?) that creates additional snapshots.~~   Testing Instructions Snapshots + Integrations tests"

On 1.8.4 running multiple turbo dev --filter vercel-site can sometimes cause a race condition where the node process is left hanging causing errors regarding ports being used.

One thing to note is we apply this transform for the ecma / typescript regardless, since decorators can be applied in either cases.

PR expands enable_jsx option to accept few more configuration point to jsx transforms, mainly its import source. We'll likely to expand options more in the future. One thing I noted in the code but didn't make change is enable_react_refresh, if it needs to be under the jsx option or should be independent. Given react_refresh only should be enabled when jsx is enabled, for me it makes more sense to move it."
299,"If a graph walk task fails, stop the walk.  (#4254)","Description Backstory: I was investigating what needs to be done to support unifying our output to support grouping log output. I encountered an os.Exit sitting in run, and while attempting to address that, discovered that we don't fully stop on error even when we mean to. We stop executing scripts but we continue to walk the graph, meaning that we can trigger cache restorations. This PR: - Adds a short-circuiting mechanism to our graph walk so that tasks started after the failed tasks are skipped. Note that tasks started concurrently with the failed task may still run. - Remove the os.Exit for the case where we fail to do the setup work to capture task outputs - Adds a test for short-circuiting using a custom visitor to deterministically inject an error into graph traversal Testing Instructions New test in engine_test.go demonstrates short-circuiting by injecting an error into graph traversal. I opted for a unit test in this case because using a failing script in an integration test will not trigger the broken behavior. We shut down the script-running facility once a script fails. The error needs to occur outside of the user's script to demonstrate the bug, hence a custom graph visitor.  Co-authored-by: Mehul Kar mehul.kar@vercel.com"

326,fix: prune pnpm patched dependencies with peer dependencies (#4200),"Description Fixes #4133 (huge thanks to @shawnmcknight for the reproduction) The crux of the issue was that if a dependency is patched and peer dependencies than both get encoded into the lockfile key. We can't construct a full expected lockfile key from the patch entry anymore as the patch entry doesn't contain information about peer dependencies. To circumvent this we now scan through the entire package list, parse the key, extract the patch hash (if present), and then check if it matches a patch listed in patchedDependencies. Notes for reviewers: - A large portion of this PR is actually porting the lockfile key parsing logic that pnpm itself uses so we can extract the individual pieces that we care about. This logic is in a slightly messy state as the pnpm codebase is currently in a state where it supports v5 and v6 lockfiles. As mentioned in https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/5810 once pnpm@8 lands this code will start to be refactored. I tried to keep the Go port as 1:1 as possible in hopes to make future maintenance easier. - This PR includes new logic for v6 as pnpm now encodes patches in lockfile keys: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/5979 Testing Instructions Added new packages to the pnpm lockfile fixtures that are patched and have peer dependencies. Also verify that the changes work as expected with the provided repro:  - make turbo  - Clone https://github.com/shawnmcknight/turbo-pnpm-patch-repro - Remove private dependency: pushd packages/test && pnpm rm @sheet/core && popd  - turbo_dev --skip-infer prune --scope=test - Verify that out/pnpm-lock.yaml contains a patchedDependencies section with both @types/jsonwebtoken@8.5.9 and moleculer@0.14.28 as entries"

347,"Add ""nextpack"" integration setup (#4188)","Hopefully this'll ease our developing in Next.js ``` Nextpack is the development sub-repo, allowing us to develop Next.js features and Turbopack together. This sub-repo will stitch together the rust crates in Next.js and the crates in Turbo, so they appear as 1 logical Cargo workspace. There are two steps: ```bash This will clone next.js into ./next.js if you wanted, you can link your own already-checked-out next.js repo. $ ./scripts/init.cjs This read the Cargo.toml from Next.js and Turbo, generating a new Cargo.toml workspace in this directory. $ cargo run --bin sync-workspace ``` FAQs Failed to load manifest for workspace member ‚Ä¶ You can't have an optional workspace member (or if you can, I can't figure it out). So the ./next.js/‚Ä¶ crate members are gonna error out if you try to run a Turbo crate without first cloning next.js. To fix, run ./scripts/init.js again. It'll resync your Cargo workspace. Why is init written in JS? See the above. If we wrote it in Rust, any failure in the repo setup would prevent it from running. Why is there a turbo-crates symlink dir? Cargo cannot contain nested workspaces, and if we used ../crates/turbopack as a workspace member, it would error out. By using a symlink, we avoid the problem.

382,Merge EcmascriptChunkUpdates before sending them to the client (#3975),"This diff: * introduces the VersionedContentMerger trait, which allows for merging the updates of versioned contents within the same chunk group; * implements this for EcmascriptChunkContent/EcmascriptChunkUpdate, turning them into EcmascriptMergedChunkContent/EcmascriptMergedChunkUpdate; * creates a new ChunkList asset which is capable of merging chunk updates of chunks within the same chunk group, and create such an asset for dynamic chunks (through manifest/loader_item.rs) and chunk group files assets. This fixes a bunch of edge cases related to HMR: * HMR of dynamic imports now works; * Chunks getting added/deleted/renamed now also works with HMR, since we're listening to updates at the chunk group level; * CSS chunks get reloaded in the right order, with respect for precedence. There are still known edge cases with HMR: * CSS chunks added through HMR are not inserted at the right position to respect precedence (WEB-652). * Update aggregation is disabled because we don't want a critical issue to stop all HMR (WEB-582) . This would be fixed by applying aggregated updates when dismissing the error modal, but there are some edge cases with this too (e.g. what happens when an HMR update also causes an error on top of an existing error)."

386,update next.js version (#4130),
387,Support exclusions in inputs (#4066),"Description  Support exclusion globs (!some-glob) in inputs specifications Modify file hashing for a package to only consider git status in the case where we aren't using inputs. inputs already uses git hash-object which operates on the state of the working tree, as opposed to git ls-tree which operates on a particular commit. This additionally fixes an issue where a dirty file not included in inputs could get included in the hash. Fix manual file hashing to use the correct prefix on globs (and to support exclusions) Modify globby to allow excluding individual files, not just directories  We have behavior to force excludes in globby to apply to directories, but AFAICT we don't document this behavior. Our existing documentation of excludes in outputs uses **. My preference would be to drop it so that we have a unified globbing syntax. However, my code here special-cases user input that ends in ** to maintain both behaviors. Testing Instructions A new integration test uses inputs with an exclusion to exclude a file from the hash. The excluded file is modified in the test, then hash matching and full turbo are verified. Globby has a new test as well for excluding a single file, vs a directory. taskhash_test.go has an additional edge case to handle excluding files in inputs specifications that fall back to manual file hashing.

391,"Introduce TraitRefs, remove cell_local (#3887)",".cell_local's semantics are very confusing and can be the cause of particularly hard-to-debug issues. Furthermore, they can't be nested correctly, which is necessary for my future HMR work. Instead, @sokra proposed that we should always use ReadRefs instead. This PR introduces a way to generate ReadRef-like TraitRefs for a given trait Vc. The purpose of these refs is only to be passed around, to be converted back into a Vc eventually. You can't call any other method on a TraitRef. This serves the same purpose as cell_local, as you can ""snapshot"" a value pointed to by a trait Vc through a trait ref, and re-cell that snapshot at a later time (see the tests). However, this has the same pitfall as cell_local: nested Vcs will still update. @sokra proposed we should have ValueSnapshot types which flatten nested Vcs recursively, but this will have to wait until we have time to tackle tech debt. This also introduces the ReadRef::cell method, which works the same way as TraitRef::cell but can be used on ReadRefs instead."

418,Refactor GraphTraversal to avoid non-determinism (#4098),"Description The current design of the Visit trait makes it easy to introduce non-determinism by having map_children return different results depending on the order in which it's called. For instance, if map_children tries to de-duplicate children (as is the case in ChunkContentVisit): ``` Order 1: 1. (from parent Node1) map_children([NodeA, NodeB]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeA, NodeB]) 2. (from parent Node2) map_children([NodeB, NodeC]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeC]) Order 2: 1. (from parent Node2) map_children([NodeB, NodeC]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeB, NodeC]) 2. (from parent Node1) map_children([NodeA, NodeB]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeA]) ``` These two calling orders will result in different generated graphs, as the first order will forget about the edge Node2 -> NodeB, while the second will forget about the edge Node1 -> NodeB. Instead, this PR makes it so map_children is called after inserting all nodes into the graph. This ensures that a different ordering can't affect the final shape of the graph. It also refactors the GraphTraversal::visit method and the Visit trait to make it more consistent with graph terminology and (hopefully) easier to understand. Testing Instructions This solves an issue on the branch sokra/repro-for-alex."
419,Generate a run summary file on turbo run (#4069),
420,Reduce memory usage when writing files (#3526),"This PR reduces the our total memory usage (hopefully) for files that we write to disk. When we write a file, we obviously have the input bytes (the bytes we want to write to disk). But we also read the file to see if the file needs to be written at all. This means we have another copy of the bytes, the ones that came from the disk. Worse, our write is strongly dependent on the read's RopeVc. Meaning we're stuck with that read memory until some indeterminate time. And any time we update the written contents, we're gonna get more bytes stuck in our Vc cache. The goal here is to track the file, so that we can rewrite it if it's modified/deleted. Why not have an API specific to tracking, without actually reading any contents? This PR does exactly that. And now that we don't need to read contents to track, we can avoid using the read() API (and its RopeVc) in order to do our new-old contents comparison."

An alternative would be to change Go's behavior to no longer pass the repo root as the default, but that's a larger change and the Rust and Go implementations of ChangedFiles would still differ in the same way, we'd just avoid hitting this behavior in turbo. Test plan: GO_TAG=rust make integration-tests now passes as well as the new unit test"
478,feat(codemod): support workspace configs (#3992),"This fixes turbo codemod not building due to the new config schema introduced for workspace configs.  It also adds workspace config support and tests to the codemods that are relevant (env vars and outputs). This isn't strictly necessary as workspace configs were introduced after the version that required these codemods, but I wanted to add this just in case someone uses an old example from around the web to update a workspace config or similar."

481,"Split the ES chunk module into smaller, more focused modules (#3974)","This diff splits the turbopack-ecmascript/src/chunk/mod.rs and turbopack-ecmascript/src/loader.rs modules into smaller modules, usually centered around one type. The goal of this PR is to make the ecmascript crate easier to navigate and review, as well as reduce the amount of merge conflicts that can arise from modifying imports in two separate diffs within the same module. This PR also changes the visibility of most modules within the crate to be pub(crate) so they're available to the generated register function, but not accidentally leaked outside of the crate. The same is done on a per-type basis with pub(crate) or pub(super)."
482,Include expanded inputs config for each task in dry run summary (#3957),"This PR adds an expandedInputs key for each task in the --dry=json output and Inputs Files Considered in --dry text output with a number of files considered. This only include a count, because the entire list of files could be long."
483,Update Middleware Routing (#3930),"This accomplishes 2 things: - Moves the creation of the edge info onto the Next.js side - Extracts the middleware's export const config = {}, so that we can know what matchers are needed before invoking the edge function definition. After this, an update to the Next.js side will enable middleware. Fixes WEB-623"
484,fix: make inputs relative to workspace root (#3993),"Inputs are relative to workspace and not repo root so we need to drop the cli prefix here. I removed the shim/** input as that directory no longer exists and to correctly capture these inputs we should Turbo-fy our crates instead of listing out all of the directories out here. Also, I'm not sure how we feel about a task depending on a file outside of the workspace. Test plan: pnpm -- turbo run e2e --filter=cli echo ""console.log('big change')"" >> cli/scripts/e2e/e2e.ts pnpm -- turbo run e2e --filter=cli should no longer produce a cache hit on the second run"

501,Add per-package-manager instructions to create-new (#3971),
502,Root inference: skip turbo.json (#3946),"Integration tests for inferring the root. This demonstrates that detection based upon turbo.json (and the change made in #3938) is not (particularly) relevant to root identification. How to review: - Each commit is pretty self-contained. You can see me adding a debug line to assert against in the first commit. - The third commit is both a revert of #3938 and a full deletion of the turbo.json-included detection logic.  OUTDATED There is _one_ behavior change. If you previously: 1. Had nested workspaces (which is not supported by us or any package manager). 2. Had a `turbo.json` at the ""outer"" one. 3. Did _not_ have a `turbo.json` at the ""inner"" one  Then we would have selected the outer one. We now select the inner one, and throw an error because the inner one does not have a `turbo.json`. I believe this to be an _improvement_.   3938 treats any turbo.json that has comments in it as nonexistent since serde_json doesn't support JSONC. That everything still worked with parsing that is throwing an error made it clear that the turbo.json check was not being used except for the described edge case."
503,Update getting started to depend on turbo.json for order (#3859),"With the improvements to dependOn, it seems to be that this is the new best practice and not having the order defined in the npx turbo run ... This would make it easier for new adopters how to structure their turborepo project"
504,Update index.mdx (#3958),
505,feat(turbo-utils): bundle to esm (#3952,"Now that we're throwing a few more things in turbo-utils, we should bundle it to esm instead of cjs to support code splitting. This is an internal package, and everything that consumes this bundles to cjs, so compatibility isn't an issue, and this will ensure each package that uses a util from turbo-utils only gets what it needs instead of the entire package. I tested this locally to see the bundle size difference.  For turbo-ignore, the bundle size drops from 245K to 229K. No huge (~6%) but worth it."
506,Fix issue with --filter when only root pkg contains task (#3951),"Always look up task definition, but limit when it's added to the task graph. This allows us to lazy look up task definitions for the purpose of making sure they are defined, even if we aren't going to run them."

532,Support NeedData responses in SourceMap/SourceMapTrace ContentSources (#3907),"This implements a new ContentSourceProcessor trait and WrappedContentSource struct that allows our ContentSources to register some processor to transform the eventual ContentSourceContent that an inner ContentSource returns. Yah, it's a bit of a mouthful with lots of very similar sounding names. Essentially, the old SourceMapContentSource and NextSourceMapTraceContentSource wrapped some inner ContentSource, and would request content from them, and process that content into a source map JSON or trace JSON. But, they didn't implement the NeedData response, so it only supported very primitive inner content sources. This PR extracts that knowledge into a single WrappedContentSource, which will recursively wrap every ContentSourceResult until we land on a fully resolved ContentSourceResult::Result. At that point, it hands off the work to a WrappedGetContentSource, which performs the processing on whatever content is returned by the inner GetContentSourceContent. If you can't tell yet, I'm making the description intentionally verbose to highlight just how similar our struct/trait names are. Fixes WEB-614"
533,Make chunk_content_internal parallel (#3836),"This switches the chunk_content_internal function from a sequential BFS to a parallel BFS (+ reverse topological sort at the end). I expected this to make some difference in performance, as traversing references in parallel can lead to better CPU usage (see #3771), but in practice our benchmarks show no significant difference. Real apps might be a different story, but I didn't notice any particular performance improvement on vercel.com either. This implementation is not perfect (we're making more calls to get_children than strictly necessary), but I think it's enough to measure a potential performance improvement. Marking this as a draft for now as it's more complicated than the current implementation and there's no clear win to adopting this."

Rather than attempt to get go building with msvc, we can instead just rely on windows' x86 emulation and publish one set of binaries for that platform until go is removed from our toolchain altogether."

This removal will also apply to ""single package"" repos where the prefix is just <task>: This new option is intended to alleviate some user issues piping logs into other tools, but comes with a Buyer Beware warning that logs from parallel tasks are still interleaved. We may implement a buffering mechanism (long time issue: #219), that will further help with this, but this PR does not do that."

553,loaders: use pre-compiled loader-runner distributed with Next.js (#3823),"The benefit of this depends on https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45962, but it remains compatible with apps including loader-runner. This first attempts to require loader-runner from the app's installed version of Next.js, falling back to requiring the package directly. We should probably eventually remove this fallback once all compatible versions of Next.js include the precompiled version, as that has a more predictable version of the package. Test Plan: Linked a local copy of Next.js including https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45962 to an app without loader-runner that uses loaders and verified loaders ran."
554,add possible unknown mutation to objects and arrays (#3882),Before the static evaluation didn't consider the fact that objects and arrays can be mutated. So we can't just assume for sure that they have certain properties/items. Instead we add an unknown mutation alternative to handle that. This avoids if(obj.prop) to be replaced with if(true) when prop is initialized with true. It might be modified in future.

If you're using an older Next version, then the router doesn't have a type field    - Because the type field is empty, we hit neither the rewrite nor none cases and fall through to the middleware case, returning an empty response with no body.    - This is fixed by treating { url: string, headers: ‚Ä¶ } as { type: 'rewrite', url: string, headers: ‚Ä¶ }"

616,perf: skip visiting if it's out of range (#3762),"Visiting is not necessary for those sub-trees that are already out of range. The first code change For example, we have visitors with ast_path like this, and the current index is 1, and the current path is Path::A: ```rust enum Path {   A,   B,   C,   D,   E } visitors: vec![(vec![Path::B, Path::C], visitor), (vec![Path::B, Path::D], visitor)] ``` Given the fact that sub-trees that are not matched were already skipped, so there is no possibility for us to have things like this if we are already under Path::B and looking for the next path (ast_path: [Path::B]):  rust visitors: vec![(vec![Path::B, Path::C], visitor), (vec![Path::C, Path::A], visitor)] Combining all the things above, we can skip visits any furthur where its kind is greater than the kind for the current index, for the first example, the underlying path is Path::A, we can skip the sub-tree Path::C and Path::D as there's no possibility for the visitor subscribers to do with them. The second code change If the starting point for the partition result is already greater than the underlying kind, it's not necessary for us to visit them too."

618,Update $schema for turbo.json. (#3789),The in-editor recommendations for turbo.json that come from $schema seem to have fallen behind the API in a few spots. I also took a moment to update some language for improved clarity. I also had to shave a few yaks to work on this: - Updated docs#dev task to ensure it generates the schema.json when we run pnpm run docs - Improve deprecation note for environment variables - Added errors-only to outputMode doc

627,fix integration tests on windows (#3737),For windows it's important that the browser is dropped so that the test can complete. To do that we need to cancel the spawned task below (which will drop the browser). For this we are using a JoinSet which cancels all tasks when dropped.
628,Issue Reporters (#3707),"Big thanks to @jridgewell for helping me out with a number of Rust-isms with this change. This expands handle_issues and the NextDevServerBuilder to accept an arbitrary IssueReporter -- a trait implementing report_issues which receives captured issues to send somewhere. This replaces using a fixed ConsoleUi to send issues to stdout/stderr, though ConsoleUi now implements IssueReporter and is the default implementation of an issue reporter if no other is provided. It also moves the responsibility of detecting fatal errors out of ConsoleUi and into handle_issues itself. This lays the foundation for alternative reporters, such as a test reporter to snapshot or assert against issues emitted, or a newline-delimited JSON reporter for other tools to consume.

640,fix: use prerelease update-informer to cut ureq (#3726),update-informer has some good stuff in the pipeline that allows us to specify the http client we use. This is a quick and dirty add support for the updater on Windows ARM. If we don't want to use a non-release version of update-informer than #3722 should be merged instead of this. I expect a new release of update-informer might take a little bit as this is a breaking change due to the updated Registry trait definition.

646,Add req.cookies to API requests (#3695),"This PR does a little bit more than what it says on the box. Before, we were parsing URL queries and request headers, only to serialize them some other way afterwards. The reason why we were parsing headers and queries is because we sometimes need to filter them. However, we don't need that for router/page SSR/page API. This PR makes it so we avoid parsing on Turbopack's side through rawHeaders and rawQuery."

The assumption while iterating (for streaming, equality checks, etc) is that the only time we can hit an empty Bytes section is when we reach the end of the entire Rope. If an empty section is hit in the middle of a rope, we can't tell if we've reached the end or we're in the middle without calling N more times (eg, what if an empty section followed an empty section, then we'd need to call 2 more times to see).

Coupled with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45506, we'll be able to fully automate our release process into Next.js.  The process kicks of with cron every midnight-ish PST. We find the latest commit that passes CI We bump the latest tag version (more on this in a bit) We generate a new GH release with this version  The automated tagging version will break with our current turbopack-YYMMDD.XYZ release process just a bit. The tag action that I'm using can't generate a date-like tag, it can only handle semver (with optional prefix). So I've set it up to generate turbopack-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-nightly.XYZ tags. The turbopack- here differentiates us from Turborepo, and the nightly tag denotes this a non-release software.

711,fix glob parsing and improve error reporting (#3644),Our glob parser was not able to parse alternatives that contain a slash: {a/b}
712,Support for getStaticPaths.fallback = false (#3600),"Adds support for getStaticPaths returning { fallback: false } by building out all static paths and checking whether the resolved path is included in that list. buildStaticPaths requires the next.config.js path, as well as other config options such as locale. I created WEB-546 to track being able to pass them to the handlers."
713,[docs] Fix typo: pipline => pipeline (#3635),
714,Fix enable_mdx short flag conflict with exact flag (#3622),
715,Load TaskDefinitions lazily when building taskGraph (#3562),"Previously, before the Engine struct is Prepared for execution, Turbo stored a map of core.Task instances to look up Task Definitions.  This change removes that behavior and instead looks up TaskDefinitions during task graph construction. This bakes in the assumption that there is more than one place for Tasks to be defined, which is a pre-requisite for composable configs. This implementation hardcodes looking up the turbo.json from the root workspace, but in the future, we'll update to start looking for the TaskDefinition in the task's workspace."
716,Send Next.js Integration test results to Slack (#3591),"This uses Slack's GitHub action [0] to send the contents of the summary markdown file to a custom workflow for posting in Slack. Since the markdown file includes newlines and quotes, this uses jq to escape it and format a new json file that the action reads. Test Plan: Manually run the workflow against this branch [0] https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action  Co-authored-by: OJ Kwon 1210596+kwonoj@users.noreply.github.com"
717,Hoist DryRunSummary fields to PackageTask (#3615),"The PackageTask abstraction has some statically analyzable information about the task, and DryRunSummary collects the rest. Hoisting as much of this information up to the PackageTask will make it easier to make it available on RealRuns without duplicating code. Ideally, DryRun doesn't do anything except print the information we already have."
718,release(turborepo): 1.7.3 (#3627),Co-authored-by: Turbobot turbobot@vercel.com
719,add helper for walking a tree concurrently and deterministic (#3619),"Similar to our try_join helper this adds a try_flat_map_recursive_join helper, which allows to async expand a tree structure into all nodes. It will call the async mapper function concurrently to allow parallelism. It will handle circular and duplicate references and return all nodes in a determinstic way (breath-first)."
720,fix: SSO Login (#3626),
721,always allow to close the error overlay (#3624),"It's difficult to test an app, if a single error blocks using the whole page. Therefore, error overlay should always be closeable."
722,feat: Use lockfiles when determining what packages changed across commits (#3250),"This PR attempts to address #2162 This PR was written to be conservative by nature and it will mark packages as changed on almost any lockfile change that isn't just a version bump. Notable changes: - Extended SCM interface as we need to be able to reconstruct old lockfile - Refactored calculation of the transitive closure of the package graph so a full Context object isn't required - Merged TransitiveDeps and ExternalDeps as they contained almost identical information I haven't been able to fully test this, but from a quick spot check of pnpm it seems to behave as expected. Needed testing:  [x] Npm [x] Yarn [x] Yarn2+ [x] Pnpm"
723,fix: mismatched pnpm lockfile version resolution (#3611),Fixes #3564 I created a regression when adding support for pnpm lockfileVersion: 6 that caused us to not include some indirect dependencies of a workspace. A package would be missing only if a workspace had a direct dependency on the package that was also included as an indirect dependency where the version ranges didn't overlap. See the new test fixture for a basic version of how this could occur. Huge thanks to @shawnmcknight for providing a reproduction!

734,Add print_task_invalidation feature (#3537),"I used this to track down the infinite looping behavior #3525 and #3526. Running cargo run --features print_task_invalidation --bin next-dev will print something similar to: ``` invalidated Task { id: 16875, name: ConditionalContentSource::get } Task { id: 16875, name: ConditionalContentSource::get } invalidates:     Task { id: 16873, name: CombinedContentSource::get }     Task { id: 16832, name: CombinedContentSource::get }     Task { id: 16815, name: CombinedContentSource::get }     Task { id: 16807, name: CombinedContentSource::get }     Task { id: 15384, name: get_from_source } invalidated Task { id: 16873, name: CombinedContentSource::get } invalidated Task { id: 16832, name: CombinedContentSource::get } invalidated Task { id: 16815, name: CombinedContentSource::get } invalidated Task { id: 16807, name: CombinedContentSource::get } invalidated Task { id: 15384, name: get_from_source } invalidated Task { id: 71537, name: DiskFileSystem::read } invalidated Task { id: 71517, name: DiskFileSystem::write } invalidated Task { id: 72217, name: DiskFileSystem::read } invalidated Task { id: 72214, name: DiskFileSystem::write }"
735,Capture engine/run unit tests with prysk (#3592),"This converts unit tests exercising the task graph to integration tests.  The purpose of this change is to make it easier to land lazy loading task definitions, which breaks all these unit tests, due to their use of the AddTask API to setup the test. Additionally, the lazy loading feature will require that these tests have access to the file system to read from config file, which would make them closer to integration tests already. Note that the new tests are here are:  not 1:1 with the old ones, but attempt to capture the scenarios in spirit. asserted with --graph, because parallel execution makes it a bit more challenging to assert against logs. combined with existing topological-deps tests"
736,chore: Removed Cargo.lock from CI for PRs (#3558),"We remove this requirement so that PRs for just turborepo code + Cargo.lock or just turbopack code + Cargo.lock can only run the corresponding Turbopack/Turborepo workflows, thus saving time. Since the workflows are still run on main, we can catch dependency errors before shipping."

741,Share request resolving logic between http and update servers (#3597),"With the addition of the Next.js routing layer at the root of our content sources, we need the update server to also be able to follow Next.js rewrites, like the HTTP server. This requires the following: * Rewrites need to be able to indicate a source where to ""resume"" after rewriting. Otherwise, we would enter an infinite loop of the Next.js layer rewriting to the Next.js layer. * The resolving logic from process_request_with_content_source needs to be extracted into its own function, so it may be called both from the HTTP server (which expects fully resolved ReadRefs) and the update server (which needs a VersionedContentVc): this is where resolve_source_request comes in.

742,add rust_prepare to Ok requirements (#3599),Before that the PR will be Ok even if rust code doesn't compile
743,improve error reporting for fatal errors (#3550),This adds the turbo-tasks function name as context of all fatal errors propagated from executing or reading turbo-tasks functions. That should help in debugging fatal errors.
744,fix: bring back tty into ci detection (#3589),3586 changed how we calculate IsCI and dropped the !IsTTY start to the calculation. This breaks our cmdutil tests as they require the IsCI flag to be true when the test is running. We need IsCI to be true otherwise we won't look at VERCEL_ARTIFACTS_TOKEN as a possible token source.
745,fix: pnpm prune misses git dependency (#3517),Fixes #2870 The resolved version of a github: dependency is the lockfile key of the package so now when resolving a package we check and see if we can find a package by using just the version instead of /name@version. This is built on top of #3483 so review that first.

Instead of rewriting unit tests, this updates the tests to integration tests. This will also make them  resilient to the Rust port."
749,fix(use correct serialization logic for turbo.json) (#3580),"Fixes #3570  The issue here was that we implemented the custom marshalling behavior on a pointer of TaskDefinition, but the pipeline is map[string]TaskDefinition. I chose to change the MarshalJSON implementation to not be on a pointer type. I also added custom marshalling behavior to output mode so we no longer output the number of the enum."

771,Wrap CSS chunk items in a @layer (#3542),"In Turbopack, as a consequence of our lazy compilation model, CSS chunks can contain duplicate CSS chunk items. This can cause issues with precedence. Take the following example: Initial CSS chunk: ```css / ... / / chunk item A / h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } / ... / / other chunk item / h1 {   font-size: 4rem; } / ... / ``` Dynamic CSS chunk (loaded after the first page load completes) ```css / ... / / chunk item A / h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } / ... / ``` In this example, when the page first loads, the following rule will be applied: css h1 {   font-size: 4rem; } But as soon as the dynamic CSS chunk loads, the following rule will be applied instead: css h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } However, from the order of rules in the initial load, we know that the former should still apply. We can remedy this particular issue by wrapping each CSS chunk item into its own @layer (thanks @sokra for the idea!). This ensures that when a CSS chunk item is re-encountered at a later time, it is automatically de-duplicated thanks to the inherent CSS layering algorithm. This is not an issue in Next.js as we can't have duplicated CSS chunk items."

These options are verified to be serializable and passed to loader-runner and exposed as getOptions() to the loader. Test Plan: Added an integration test for basic options. Verified the serializable check by passing class Foo {}; new Foo() as an option value and verified the error was displayed."

Previously, generated classnames would include literal / characters, which need escaping when generating selectors. While users should still escape selectors, this avoids it for this case and makes generated code easier to read. This format is also more aligned with what webpack-based css modules generates. This also removes the square character as a separator, since it breaks words and makes double-clicking for selection more difficult."

789,fix: pnpm prune misses root dependency (#3483),Fixes #2798 which comprised of two issues: - We eagerly checked if a version specifier was already resolved in the package list. This can lead to grabbing a version of the package that doesn't have the expected peer dependencies. This was as easy as moving this check after we have gone down the happy path. - Not copying internal dependencies of the monorepo root. We now internally add // to the prune scope to make sure we get any internal dependencies. For reviewers: I highly recommend reviewing the first commit in this PR initially as it unifies the pnpm lockfile implementations. I realized that my code split was unnecessary and made fixing bugs for lockfile v5 and v6 very difficult.

794,Allow controlling depth of Vc debugging (#3512),"Adds a mechanism for controlling the depth of Vc debugging, to avoid printing out huge structs when we're only interested in some superficial overview of it. This will only affect Vcs: if a Vc contains a non-Vc, very deep struct, the struct will be fully printed out. This is because you can't control the printing depth of the default Rust Debug trait. Marking this as a draft for now as I intend to change the name and arguments of dbg_depth. rust eprintln!(""{:?}"", some_vc.dbg_depth(2).await?) // will now only print up to a depth of 2"
795,Ignore non-JS chunks on the server (#3507),I also considered not including invalid chunks for the current environment in the ManifestChunkAsset. This could use the result of the EnvironmentVc::chunk_loading() method. I'm partial to neither solution.
796,Align ids and data attributes with Next.js's redbox (#3522),Next.js's integration test suite depends on these ids and data attributes to select against items in running test pages. This gets us passing some of those tests.

798,Fix infinite loop caused by error page rendering (#3525),"The new error paths introduced in #3448 both write their outputs to .next/server/pages/, which conflicts with: - The main pages source - Each other The infinite loop is very fun: 1. We need a NodeJsPoolVc to render pages 2. To get a NodeJsPoolVc, you need to write your files onto disk     - So a pool is dependent on the contents of those files 3. When we render an error page, we need to write those files to disk 4. The error page shares the same file entrypoint as the main page source So, to render an error, we write the entrypoint, which is shared with main source. This alone is pretty bad, because it will invalidate our page source's node pool (and kill those processes). But, the loop is triggered by a more subtle bug: When we write a file, we read it to see if the contents have changed. Writing creates a dependency on the read! So when the error page is written to disk, it invalidated the read we preformed when we wrote the main page. That invalidated the main page (and it's node pool), and so we rendered again. That wrote the main page's code to disk, invalidating the read of the error page performed when we wrote the error page. ‚ôæÔ∏è (I'll be opening more PRs‚Ä¶)"

816,fix: Skip over repo root package for package inferrence (#3503),"Once again map iteration is the culprit. The failure of infer_pkg.t is caused by package inference iterating over the root package before the correct candidate package. This results in pkgPath == repoRoot and since fullInferencePath is necessarily contained in the repo root, the root package will always be selected as the exact package. The fix is just skipping over the root package. First commit adds a root package to the tests. The package inference cases will fail in a non-deterministic fashion since this bug depends on the repo root package being iterated over before the package that should be inferred. The next commit is a fix."
817,Handle routing by calling Next.js code (#3446),"This implements routing by using a-yet-to-be-implemented API exposed by Next.js. The API follows something similar to: ```typescript type MakeResolver = (config: NextConfig) => Resolver; type Resolver = (IncomingMessage, ServerResponse) => Promise | void; import { makeResolver } from ""next/dist/...""; const resolver  = makeResolver(nextConfig as object); // Later, once we have a request we'd like to route: // We don't care what the promise resolved to, we just want it to settle. await resolver(req, res); ``` The resolver can do 1 of 3 things with this: 1. ~~Return a redirect response~~ Removed 2. Return a rewrite response 3. Stream a middleware response  ~~1. Return a redirect response~~    First, ensure a `x-nextjs-route-result: 1` header is present on the response. Then return a JSON encoded body:  ```typescript {   url: string,   statusCode: u16,   headers: Record   isRedirect: true } ```  The Rust server will then respond with a redirect using to the appropriate location.     Return a rewrite response   First, ensure a x-nextjs-route-result: 1 header is present on the response. Then return a JSON encoded body: typescript {   url: string,   headers: Record<string, string> } The Rust server will use this updated URL to request content from our handlers.   Stream a middleware response   Ensure x-nextjs-route-result header is not present on the response. All headers will be sent back, and the body will be streamed back to the browser.  TODO: - ~~Do headers actually matter to a redirect~~ Yes? - ~~Does statusCode actually matter to a rewrite?~~ No - ~~We can't handle streaming body responses yet.~~ Mocked by buffering.

Instead, we should just skip applying hooks when creating commits from this workflow. ~Since the create-pull-request doesn't have a way of disabling hooks, simply remove the file before husky installs it into place.~ Let cargo fmt run on individual files through lint-staged, but don't run it on everything on every precommit.

856,chore: Port configuration files to Rust (#3440),"A full Rust port of configuration reading and writing. This PR is probably best reviewed in each individual commit. This PR establishes, but doesn't enforce a pattern of ConfigLoader, Config, and ConfigInner. In the future we can generalize this to reduce boilerplate, but considering we have two configs at the moment that seemed like overkill.  ConfigInner: This is the configuration file layout on disk. This is just a data object and shouldn't have any logic Config: Handles the applying of defaults and writing config updates to disk. Internally it holds onto a copy of the config that comes from the file exclusively to avoid accidentally writing a value that was provided via command line or environment variable to the configuration file. ConfigLoader: Handles the loading of the Config structure this is where the command line overrides are applied and can be used to mock out the environment to allow for testing without polluting the test proc's environment.  Notes: - We need to use a handrolled MappedEnvironment to provide custom mappings from environment variable names to config file keys. e.g. TURBO_TEAM gets mapped to teamslug in config.json"
857,fix(release): build turbo-ignore (#3452),
858,refactor content sources to avoid evaluating content before serving (#3334),"fixes WEB-141 This changes the ContentSource API. Before a ContentSource returned a tuple of specificity and content. Now it returns a tuple of specificity and a get_content function. The old way made it very inefficient to combine multiple ContentSource. All combined ContentSources were ask before, all returned specificity and content, and they are ordered after that. That required to compute all contents, even if it is not really used after ordering. Now we order specificity and a get_content function and only compute the content (by calling get_content) with the final result. It also changes how data needs are expressed in the get_content function. Instead of asking it over and over again with more data, it statically returns the needed data with vary and the get function is only called with that data. This is technically more limited than the old way, but one can workaround that if needed. But practically we probably never need that. On the other hand it improves the number of function calls, since the vary method is only called once and the get only once per request. Before data needs required at least 2 get calls per request."

861,Store TaskDefinitions in the Graph by Task ID (#3428),"Moves TaskDefinitions in the CompleteGraph struct, so we can look it up during execution. We want to do this here, because during execution, The TaskGraph has already been constructed, so it is too late to change the definition at the point. Although this commit does not try to change any TaskDefinitions, we will implement that for composable configs in the future."
862,Refactor task dependencies retrieval to support composable configs (#3410),"This means we look up a task's dependencies when iterating per-workspace, rather than per-task. This will allow us to customize each task per workspace based on additional config that may be present in that workspace. After this change, core.Task is essentially a tuple that contains the Task name and the Task Definition.  This follows the work in 2a8832b4b that moved other parts of TaskDefinition retrieval to per-workspace."
863,feat: add support for pnpm v6 lockfiles (#3352),"Add support for pnpm lockfile v6 (https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/5810) Notable changes in the lockfile v6: - Lockfile keys are encoded as /name@version as opposed to /name/version - Specifiers are inline with resolved versions as opposed to being in their own field - Packages with multiple peer dependencies no longer have the peer dependencies hashed Notes: - We currently just attempt to parse the v5 structure and if that fails we attempt v6. We do this since lockfile version can be decided by a combination of pnpm version and .npmrc contents. In the future once pnpm@8 is widely used we can switch the ordering of this if it becomes a performance bottle neck - A lot of the implementation was copy/pasta for the slightly different structure. I could have gone the route of making most of these functions work on map[string]interface{}, but I don't love doing type assertions all over the place."

This allows local turbos that support it to calculate package inference, without passing a bad argument to local turbos that don't yet have this feature. Adds --pkg-inference-root flag, intended to be passed by the shim after calculating an appropriate value, based on the monorepo root and TURBO_INVOCATION_DIR env variable. Adds code to update TargetSelector instances in the presence of an inferred directory. If there's a single package at or above the directory, use that. Otherwise, consider the directory to be a prefix on a parentDir specifier Pass TargetSelector instances by reference so they can be updated in place Add to the global integration test to demonstrate package inference from a directory, as well as bypassing inference by passing --cwd"

875,ci(actions): report failed --turbo next.js tests (#3350),"Closes WEB-168. This PR changes the behavior of next.js integration test in this repo to run everything with --turbo by default, instead of manually opt in per each PR. Since current next.js integration tests are expected to fail with turbopack, PR adds changes   Do not fail CI when next.js integration test fails So we can keep CI checker green for  the daily workflow   Report failed tests in the PR comment  Instead, report failed tests in the comment, like https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/3350#issuecomment-1387356900   This is largely similar to what next.js upstream does for failing report, but does not use exact same webhook since the way CI pipeline sets up is bit different so we can't use it out of the box. However, the logic in the custom action is short & straightforward enough to keep internally. One thing to note is this report uses default automatic github auth token (user github-actions bot). This means report comment will not be created if PR is created from fork, but I expect that's acceptable limitation. There maybe some improvements we want to add, like diff-between-main but probably not a high priority & maybe we can fix all the turbopack faster than having those."
876,Handle empty pageData during HMR (#3412),"Our pageData HMR process treated an undefined response as an error condition, but if the page doesn't have a getXyzProps exported method, then this is the default response. This prevented us from having any pages without page props. The new code just sends down an empty object, which seems to work for establishing the connection. HMR updates are sent down (and seem to trigger restarts, at least from what I tested with getStaticProps). Fixes WEB-445"

Adds tests, fixtures, and new transform boilerplate. Moved from meow to commander.js for arg parsing  Reviewers Guide This PR is huge. But it‚Äôs almost all tests and fixtures. I have split the commits for easier review: 1. new arg parsing 2. rewrite transforms 3. add codemod generation 4. add migrate command 5. add tests FAQ Q. Why not just use jscodeshift?  A. It would be major overkill. We don‚Äôt need AST‚Äôs. Everything we touch (and likely will touch for the foreseeable future) is JSON. Q. Why add an extra class for file transforms? A. This abstracts away the need to care about the CLI options or handle output. Writing a new transform is as simple as - 1. read the file, 2. make changes, 3. pass it to runner.modifyFile. It does the rest (logging, determining when to write, file diffing, consistent outputs, consistent logging) TODO:  [ ] Update codemod docs and in-product reccomendations"

As noted, this does not mock responses from Google for the font resources themselves, which are currently loaded by the test browser. This means that we'll be dependent on this external service for passing integration tests until we implement caching of url()s in Turbopack. We should monitor the reliability of this test."

It doesn't support writing configs to disk out of the box, but this can be solved with a wrapper struct. This can probably be abstracted to be generic over different configs, but we should hold off until that seems beneficial. - termcolor is used for coloring output, this is the same crate that env_logger uses for coloring outputs. The UI struct is expected to be passed into any subcommands that need pretty output. - A slight behavior change is that we no longer delete the entire config file and instead make the token null (""token"": null).

1026,Page data HMR (#3132),"Based on #2968  This builds upon #2968 and @ForsakenHarmony's work on data routes to enable page data HMR. Page data HMR is a bit more clever than it is in Next.js as we won't re-render a Node.js result for each page file update. Instead, thanks to the StripPageDefaultExport transform, there are three versions of the page chunks: * client-side (strips page data exports); * server-side (full); * data server-side (strips page default export). Instead of subscribing to the full server-side result, on hydration, the client-side page separately subscribes to: * client-side updates (already the case); * data server-side updates (new). This means that updating something that only affects the page component will only cause a client-side update and no Node.js re-rendering, while updating something that only affects the data will only cause a server-side update. ~~I'm marking this as a draft for now as there are still a few areas to test/investigate:~~ - [x] When something that is used in both the default page export and data exports is changed, this will cause two HMR updates: one data update, and one client-side chunk update. The same case breaks in Next.js, where we will receive a client-side update, but no server-side update, ending up with an incorrect result. - [x] Differences between getStaticProps/getServerSideProps, as well as getInitialProps (need to talk with @timneutkens about this) (see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/44523) Co-authored-by: kodiakhq[bot] 49736102+kodiakhq[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

1029,Refactor the Next SSG transform to handle the inverse operation (#2968),"The original transform The original behavior of the Next SSG transform is to remove getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getStaticPaths from Next.js page files so they can be bundled for the client. This is what enables the following code to work properly without advanced tree shaking: ```jsx import db from ""db""; import PostCounter from  export default function Home(props) {   return <>{props.posts.length} post(s); } const postsPromise = db.getPosts(); export async function getStaticProps() {   return {     props: {       posts: await postsPromise,     },   }; } ``` The transform is able to remove both getStaticProps and all its exclusive, transitive dependencies, so this is what the client would see: jsx import PostCounter from ""components/PostCounter""; export var __N_SSG = true; export default function Home(props) {     return __jsx(PostCounter, {         count: props.posts.length     }); } Adding the inverse operation However, to support proper HMR for these data exports, we need to be able to execute somewhat of an inverse operation: remove the default component export, but preserve all the rest. This allows Turbopack to bundle server-side only declarations, only re-rendering when one of these changes, instead of re-rendering on any server-side and client-side change. From our module above, the updated transform is now also able to generate the following: jsx import db from ""db""; const postsPromise = db.getPosts(); export async function getStaticProps() {     return {         props: {             posts: await postsPromise         }     }; } As you can see, this module is no longer importing the PostCounter, which means re-rendering will not invalidate when that counter changes. However, if the ""db"" module changes, we will still be able to detect a change and re-render. Other notes  I renamed the transform from ""next_ssg"" to ""next_transform_strip_page_exports"". It's much more verbose, but hopefully also much clearer about what it does at a glance. I took the liberty to clean up and comment some parts of the transform to make it more easily understandable (at least for someone like me, who hasn't written a lot of SWC code). I also fixed a few bugs and edge cases. I brought over the tests from the transform in the Next.js and added a couple of them. For now, only the StripDataExports filter is used. A future PR will build on this and @ForsakenHarmony's https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2949 PR to actually implement SSR/SSG HMR.   Reviewing guide  The crux of the change is the move (and refactor) of the next ssg transform from https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-133d73657647ed793ca4782a73552650b32ad565094b1e0faf452ad58705499b to https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-d6442fa6af9b66e581f062739dd6de2419f5e8f6f3d97cfa63518c72b0a9ee3e. I also added the errors.rs and fixture.rs tests. I adapted fixture.rs to execute on the two transform filters: data exports and default export. Most of the tests in tests/ are copied from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-swc/crates/core/tests. The changes I made are:   i. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-774abee6a1bf139c9ce55e226bf15b52e56ea091170ee5d6295c191fd8d793c7: made this one symmetric for both strip data and strip default transforms.   ii. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-4792266a264dc67da93748d2c6522917f860527a689891bd5f8f4add9841e7f6 wasn't supported before AFAIK.   iii. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-a3b12adbce1dec40f39ff8af13ffecbe7f6963e21bc402cef6332ecf5018877e similar to i."

This is exactly the case we're going to hit with redirect/rewrites.

This PR accomplishes 2 things: - Splits dev server address binding from setting up the handler function   - This is necessary so that we can determine the bound server address during devs retry attempts. - Propagates the server address through the ExecutionEnvironment to the UrlAssetReference I chose to pipe the server address through the ExecutionEnvironment instead of the EnvironmentIntention, because I don't fully understand the differences between them. It seems like we want it in the intention for the types of rendering, but a server address is really tied to the node process, so I don't know. Fixes WEB-318"

Note that this implementation uses 8-character long hex digests compared to the 6-character version in Next.js+webpack.

1081,Fix source map tracing for HMR updates (#3063),"HMR is handled via an eval(newCode), and that eval will inherit the filepath of the currently running file (in our case, the chunk file that contains the runtime code). To properly trace, we need to know both the chunk and the item ids, so we trace via the correct item's source map. Thankfully, we can use the (underspecified) //# sourceUrl  meta comment to name the file we're currently evaluating. That'll get used as the stack frame's file. We can then encode the chunk path and item id into the filename, and let next's stack tracing code handle the rest. This also fixes an off-by-one on the column. Source maps are 0-based, but the line/column of a file as displayed in an editor or dev tools are 1-based."

1085,Small rope improvements (#3058),"The main improvement is the addition of an uncommitted_static reference, which attempts to prioritize using a static Bytes over an extremely short owned Bytes. When a Bytes references static memory, clones of the Bytes is extremely cheap, but when it's non-static it needs to reference count."
1086,Remove chunk item source maps from the asset graph (#3059),"In order to serve source maps with HMR updates, we (used to) reference a source map asset for every chunk item using the items version hash (see #2464 and #2474 for the headaches this can cause). This update changes that, so that a chunk becomes responsible for giving access to one of its item's source map. We already have the GenerateSourceMap trait which assembles the chunk's Sectioned source map from all chunk items, so why not just allow access to an individual section? Coupled with a ContentSource that can retrieve the chunk, we can then provide access to that chunk's current item source maps per request."

1095,Fix flakey next-dev integration tests (#3020),"Fixes WEB-259 This should address the known cases of flakiness in the next-dev integration test suite. Most notably, it wraps the call to browser.new_page, which not only opens a new tab, it also navigates to the destination and waits for it to load. It also:  Migrates test code to anyhow::Result, and adds context to the new_page call should it fail again. Mitigates flakiness resulting from browser-side Jest timeouts by moving the circular correctness test to a new directory called __flakey__. These tests aren't run at all -- unfortunatley it's not possible to customize Jest's timeout with this particular version of jest-circus-browser. WEB-319 tracks updating this dependency, which hasn't been maintained in a while, unlike jest-circus itself.  Test Plan: * [x] Run the Rust test suite in CI until confident there are no intermittent failures."

UNC paths are not supported.  Defaulting to Windows directory. This PR uses dunce when normalizing paths on windows so we produce non-UNC paths which are better supported by the Windows ecosystem."

So we can do something like canary/turbo, latest/turbo etc. We should still send a fix upstream to support this more formally. But this should work for now. Updated version of https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/3017"
1101,feat(mdx): initial turbopack-mdx asset (#2979),"Implements / fix WEB-86. This PR is an initial attempt to support mdx natively inside of turbopack. It uses mdxrs (https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs) internally to interop - compile - mdx inputs into renderable ecma outputs. PR creates a new type of asset MDXAsset, and then let its extension (.mdx) can be consumed by turbopack. Since mdx is a variant of ecma asset to be rendered, it requires to perform all of the ecma transforms in the current running turbopack session. But since its AST is not compatible to plain swc (or ecma), it also cannot be passed into existing ecmaassets. MDXAsset does interop for those, by creating a virtualasset for the ecma once mdx is compiled into plain ecma. This might not be feasible appoarch and requires different way to chain asset types, something I'd like to address in this PR. I guess this will be needed for other types of assets in a long run - where input is not an ecma but requires ecma transforms (i.e vue, ng templates)."

1109,build(next/core): allow to specify tls backend for reqwest (#2994),"Implement / fixes WEB-306. We can't rely on default tls backend for reqwest and hope to work with every target platform we support, due to several constraints. Some target cannot use -sys (openssl-sys), and some can't build rustls due to trasnsitive dep support issue. PR creates explicit opt-in features for those and let upstream application can specify what they need. next-dev currently sets native-tls as default for the general dev workflow conveniences, but that doesn't mean we promote it as default feature set - next-swc, or other like standalone turbopack will configure features by themselves when build binaries for their own."
1110,Add support for new URL (#2944),"Implements new URL('./path', import.meta.url), so that the referenced file acts as a static output file, and transforms the URL into to point to that file in the graph. This is, well, complicated. As you'll see in the comments, we have an ""inert"" asset that acts as a placeholder until the module chunking algorithm gives us access to a ChunkingContextVc. It's unfortunately not available when we're doing the file parsing, but we can insert a reference to that inert asset. That inert asset will eventually create a UrlAssetChunk instance, and with that we can finally generate the correct output path for the URL referenced file. We actually discussed whether this could use a StaticAsset/StaticModuleAsset (a StaticAsset can be inserted at parse time), but it turns out that won't give us the necessary control to generate the final URL instance. A StaticModuleAsset always outputs an absolute path as it's default export, and that just won't work when we're trying to reference the file in node SSR. Fixes WEB-142.

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` ('/_a8a837.js'), `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk` ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`.  But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk`, so this PR deleted the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`, makes the graph be like this:  <img width=""1461"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-03 at 21 50 29"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42857895/205444165-7b266dce-9aa6-4829-b8dc-d2bf74642aff.png"">  And makes chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'.  commit fd09f2e7cba7bcff030c1f10f31fc0155dd055fe Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sun Dec 4 03:26:37 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update dependency @types/node to v18.11.10 (#2928)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: Thomas Knickman <tom.knickman@vercel.com>  commit 429e91eae5c313556fe8cb0bde87ab521e28d7cf Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:21:26 2022 -0500 chore(deps): update dependency @babel/core to v7.20.5 (#2919)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>  commit 6478d61585f414ec9fb6ec822d8c5c052156b690 Author: Tobias Koppers tobias.koppers@googlemail.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:11:10 2022 +0100 update chromiumoxide (#2916)  updating in hope that this fixes the random errors in test runs  commit b7bcfc312e41367e2ec7f5fb37a6ee88a6b6545a Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 08:54:50 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update rust crate futures to 0.3.25 (#2915)  [![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)  This PR contains the following updates:  | Package | Type | Update | Change | |---|---|---|---| | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dev-dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.24` -> `0.3.25` |  ---  ### ‚ö† Dependency Lookup Warnings ‚ö†  Warnings were logged while processing this repo.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path.  I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement `new URL(‚Ä¶, import.meta.url)` support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` ('/_a8a837.js'), `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk` ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`.  But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk`, so this PR deleted the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`, makes the graph be like this:  <img width=""1461"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-03 at 21 50 29"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42857895/205444165-7b266dce-9aa6-4829-b8dc-d2bf74642aff.png"">  And makes chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'.  commit fd09f2e7cba7bcff030c1f10f31fc0155dd055fe Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sun Dec 4 03:26:37 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update dependency @types/node to v18.11.10 (#2928)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: Thomas Knickman <tom.knickman@vercel.com>  commit 429e91eae5c313556fe8cb0bde87ab521e28d7cf Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:21:26 2022 -0500 chore(deps): update dependency @babel/core to v7.20.5 (#2919)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>  commit 6478d61585f414ec9fb6ec822d8c5c052156b690 Author: Tobias Koppers tobias.koppers@googlemail.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:11:10 2022 +0100 update chromiumoxide (#2916)  updating in hope that this fixes the random errors in test runs  commit b7bcfc312e41367e2ec7f5fb37a6ee88a6b6545a Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 08:54:50 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update rust crate futures to 0.3.25 (#2915)  [![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)  This PR contains the following updates:  | Package | Type | Update | Change | |---|---|---|---| | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dev-dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.24` -> `0.3.25` |  ---  ### ‚ö† Dependency Lookup Warnings ‚ö†  Warnings were logged while processing this repo.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path.  I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement `new URL(‚Ä¶, import.meta.url)` support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` ('/_a8a837.js'), `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk` ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`.  But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk`, so this PR deleted the reference between `ChunkGroup_index` and `ChunkGroup_async`, makes the graph be like this:  <img width=""1461"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-03 at 21 50 29"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42857895/205444165-7b266dce-9aa6-4829-b8dc-d2bf74642aff.png"">  And makes chunks in `ChunkGroup_async` to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'.  commit fd09f2e7cba7bcff030c1f10f31fc0155dd055fe Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sun Dec 4 03:26:37 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update dependency @types/node to v18.11.10 (#2928)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: Thomas Knickman <tom.knickman@vercel.com>  commit 429e91eae5c313556fe8cb0bde87ab521e28d7cf Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:21:26 2022 -0500 chore(deps): update dependency @babel/core to v7.20.5 (#2919)  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>  commit 6478d61585f414ec9fb6ec822d8c5c052156b690 Author: Tobias Koppers tobias.koppers@googlemail.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 22:11:10 2022 +0100 update chromiumoxide (#2916)  updating in hope that this fixes the random errors in test runs  commit b7bcfc312e41367e2ec7f5fb37a6ee88a6b6545a Author: renovate[bot] 29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com Date:   Sat Dec 3 08:54:50 2022 +0000 chore(deps): update rust crate futures to 0.3.25 (#2915)  [![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)  This PR contains the following updates:  | Package | Type | Update | Change | |---|---|---|---| | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dev-dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.21` -> `0.3.25` | | [futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/futures-rs) ([source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/futures-rs)) | dependencies | patch | `0.3.24` -> `0.3.25` |  ---  ### ‚ö† Dependency Lookup Warnings ‚ö†  Warnings were logged while processing this repo.

Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path.  I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement `new URL(‚Ä¶, import.meta.url)` support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship.

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in ChunkGroup_index ('/_a8a837.js'), ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in ChunkGroup_async ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async. But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async-manifest-chunk, so this PR deleted the reference between ChunkGroup_index and ChunkGroup_async, makes the graph be like this:  And makes chunks in ChunkGroup_async to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'."

1215,Make ESLint envVar aware. (#2850),"This optimizes for the typical use case. This means process.cwd() to find the closest turbo.json to the place where eslint was executed. Currently: - Fail, and have no keys contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (Current behavior.) After this PR, depending on your invocation patterns this will: - Do exactly what you want it to do. (Any time you invoke ESLint because we're finding up to the root of the project we will find the singular correct turbo.json.) - Fail, and have no content contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) Once we're in composable turbo.json land this will either: - Do exactly what you want it to do. (Your execution directory will find up to the closest turbo.json which is the correct composition entry point. Will be the majority of use-cases and matches the Turborepo recommendations.) - Fail, and have no content contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) - Fail, and have the wrong values contributing to the key for the incremental cache. (You ran your command from a place where you ""miss"" the correct turbo.json when trying to find up. This failure is undetectable.)  This last state needs the most explanation. When this occurs we will be adding a random set of environment variables to the cache key‚Äîand not necessarily the ones that matter. This will occur if process.cwd() does not represent the correct place in the file system to start walking to find turbo.json files. When this happens the ESLint incremental cache will be keyed on the wrong thing and won't necessarily invalidate for the correct changes, and will possibly invalidate for unrelated changes. The workaround here would be to modify the .eslintrc.js file in question to not use ""extends"": [""turbo""] and look like the following: js {   ""plugins"": [""turbo""],   ""rules"": {     ""turbo/no-undeclared-env-vars"": [       ""error"",       {         ""turboConfig"": require(""path/to/turbo.json"")       }     ]   } } We can't notify users of this failure which makes it especially rough."
1216,"Move into TaskState, drop Event (#2799)","move dependencies and event into TaskStateType remove execution_data This will drop the allocation behind Event when a task becomes Done. It also move dependencies from Task to TaskState, which make it more efficient to drop TaskState when GC is able to do that. It also reduces the total size of Task because dependencies and event share memory now."

1277,Remove default task outputs when outputs is not defined (#2712),"This behavior is frameworks-specific and unintuitive to new users. Specifically, this removes the confusion between omitting the outputs key and setting to an empty array. Additionally, this will allow us to more clearly define turbo.json composition, so locally-scoped turbo.json configs can override outputs, without rationalizing what happens to this implicit behavior."

1311,"Ability to configure ""persistent"" tasks (#2258)","This change allows users to add a persistent key to their task configuration. This key should be set when the task starts a long-running process that does not exit (such as a dev server or --watch mode for a test runner). When this key is set, turbo will ensure that no other tasks can dependsOn this task. Previously, if Task A depended on a ""persistent"" Task B, Task A would never run, because Task B never exited. This caused a lot of confusion, and our advice was to use the --parallel flag, which meant that all topological ordering was thrown out the window. After this change, turbo will detect this configuration and throw an error. After talking with users, we realized that there isn't really a need to topologically order long-running tasks, so instead of allowing configuration to create this ordering, (and then bypassing it with --parallel), we prevent you from configuring this ordering in the first place! In most cases, that means you can stop using the --parallel flag as well. If we can validate this reasoning, we can will deprecate the --parallel flag over time also."

1465,Make turbotrace test project as an independent package (#2366),"Make the crates/turbopack/tests/node-file-trace as an independent pnpm workspace. This brings 2 advantages:  Developers won't be annoyed by the installation failure issues caused by weird dependencies in the tests/node-file-trace. We can test the turbotrace in the normal pnpm mode and yarn/npm like mode with the node-linker = ""hoist"" setting.  This PR also fixes the bench-turbotrace-against-node-nft workflow: https://github.com/vercel/turbo/actions/runs/3328071952/jobs/5503635765"

1468,Update degit instructions in examples with new repo address (#2396),
1469,Speed up NoMoveVec allocations (#2398),"This speeds up NoMoveVec allocations by ensuring that new bucket initialization is just as fast as calloc. Before, we would initialize everything as Option<T>::None, which is not guaranteed to match a zeroed value because of niche optimization[1]. This comes at the cost of slightly higher memory usage, but that should be more than offset by https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2395. [1] https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=e60c0bfa4d32a3609fd39299a1c79c29"
1470,Warn on not-yet-supported import.meta usage (#2397),"This implements a warning when import.meta is referenced, both as a standalone expression (import.meta) and as a member expression (import.meta.url, import.meta.foo, etc.). To do:  * [x] This expression covers both import.meta as well as new.target. Investigate how this usage is impacted and handle it. Test Plan:  * Added a import.meta expression and import.meta.url member expression in a test app and verified both were flagged (see below) * In the same test app, verified using new.target was not flagged. ``` path/to/testapp/src/index.jsx:1:12  error TP1106 import.meta is not yet supported        1 > console.log(import.meta);        2   console.log(import.meta.url);        3         4   function Foo() {        5     new.target; path/to/testapp/src/index.jsx:2:12  error TP1106 import.meta is not yet supported        1   console.log(import.meta);        2 > console.log(import.meta.url);        3         4   function Foo() {        5     new.target;        6   } ```"
1471,Don't allocate collectibles unless necessary (#2395),"The Task struct is a chonk at 592 bytes. We allocate millions of these, so it adds up very quickly to a massive memory overhead.

This behavior only manifested in a lockfile where a pruned package had a normal dependency descriptor that also appeared as a peer dependency descriptor in a package that wasn't pruned. As background ""descriptor"" is the term Yarn uses for a semver range that appears in a package.json or lockfile entry. Amended the minimal berry lockfile to now test that we don't keep around descriptors even if they appear in peerDependencies."

Test Plan: In a new create-next-app, opt into appDirectory and create app/page.js. Run turbopack and verify: * [x] the index page renders correctly * [x] An issue with Warning level is logged notifying the user an app/layout.js was created * [x] app/layout.js is actually created with basic root layout In a new create-next-app, opt into appDirectory and create app/page.tsx.

1640,handle updates from different versions (avoid panic) (#172),Avoid the panic when updating from NotFoundVersion to EcmascriptChunkVersion
1641,Add support for API routes (#163),"This reworks our Node.js rendering logic to allow for: * passing binary request bodies in and out of Node.js: API routes can accept request bodies in POST, and can reply with any content type. * content source results that are recomputed every time: we don't want API routes to be cached (at least not by turbopack for now). It also reworks the END_OF_OPERATION logic to avoid hard coding a single end of operation marker (they're now unique per pool), and allow multiple kinds of operation events (Step, Success, Error). This is not a particularly good implementation for this. A better implementation would proxy the request from the client to the Node.js server in a more direct manner. We also need a way to tell turbo tasks ""don't bother ever caching this"", as right now every single API request and result will still be cached, even if we know they will never be used again. Finally, we should communicate with Node.js processes via a better mechanism than stdout. I made some progress on a prototype for using https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel with NAPI a while back, which I'd like to pick up some time after conf. However, it seems to work well enough for now, so yay. Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"

1720,Add ability to derive DeterministicHash (#96),"Following #94, it'd be nice to easily generate the code to deterministically hash our values. Now, we can! ```rust use turbo_tasks_hash::DeterministicHash; [turbo_tasks::value(shared)] [derive(DeterministicHash)] pub struct Foo {     bar: u32, } // expands into impl turbo_tasks_hash::DeterministicHash for Foo {     fn deterministic_hash(&self, state: &mut H) {         match self {             Foo { bar, .. } => {                 bar.deterministic_hash(state);             }         }     } } ```  This PR refactors our macro generation code to be (moderately) simple to reuse between proc_macro_derive implementations. The code was already mostly there, and I chose to use callback Fns to allow customizability for each. It generates code similar to: ```rust // The boilerplate is fully customizable fn derived_fn(&self) {     match self {         // For an enum, we expand the variants         VariantA { field, .. } => {...}         VariantB ( field_0 ) => {...}     } } // The boilerplate is fully customizable fn derived_fn(&self) {     match self {         // For an struct, we do a normal destructure         Foo { field, .. } => {...}     } } ``` Co-authored-by: Alex Kirszenberg alex.kirszenberg@vercel.com Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"
1721,build(cargo): bump up swc (#97),Bump up swc to align with next.js's latest update.
1722,Fix chunk path hashing (#94),"This follows https://github.com/vercel/the-three-body/pull/86 to finally (hopefully) fix our snapshot tests. The issue is that there we were directly observing the hash of a Vc, which is not stable. Every test run can generate new Vc wrappers, and thus receive different hash outputs. I've chosen to forbid use of DefaultHasher and Hasher trait, and instead require the use of Xxh3Hash64Hasher and a DeterministicHash trait. For values that implement DeterministicHash, you can call xxh3_hasher.write_value(value) or xxh3_hasher.write_ref(&value). Note that Vcs must themselves must be Hashable, so that they're usable in, eg, HashSet. This means it possible to indirectly observe the hash of a Vc, just not directly. We already know that iterating a HashSet is non-deterministic, so as long as you're not iterating, this is fine. This also renames turbopack-hash to turbo-tasks-hash, so that it's usable in other turbo-tasks-* crates. ```rust use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher; use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher}; fn main() {   let vc = Foo.cell();   let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new(); // This observes the Vc's hash, which is not stable.   vc.hash(&mut hasher); hasher.finish(); } ``` ```rust use turbo_tasks_hash::Xxh3Hash64Hasher; async fn main() {   let vc = Foo.cell();   let mut hasher = Xxh3Hash64Hasher::new(); // It's not (easily) possible to get a Vc's ""bytes"", so you're forced   // to await and get its value.   hasher.write(vc.await?.bar.as_bytes()); hasher.finish(); } ```"

It's:  Buggy/error-prone, at least through swc preset-env:  https://github.com/vercel/the-three-body/issues/65 setImmediate ""polyfills"" always inserted for this nonstandard feature when     React (scheduler, iirc) does feature detection of it Big.

1735,Add polyfills to Node.js externals on the client-side (#89),"We can't use the normal ImportMap because we stop resolving if looking up a request within yields a result. However, for module polyfills, we only need to look up the request when normal resolving fails. Hence the dichotomy between the import_map and the fallback_import_map. In a more modular architecture, we would model this as a stack of three resolvers:  ImportMapResolver DefaultResolver FallbackImportMapResolver  I'm guessing this is what we'll have in the future, but this requires a bigger refactoring than what I'm comfortable with implementing for now."

Some assets allows to access inner assets, e. g. from the ecmascript chunk you can access the entry module asset, so you can go a level deeper. It works by a Introspectable trait which can be implemented by anything we want to allow the user to inspect. In future the in browser UI should offer a nice UI to explore your application. In future we probably also want to add some metrics to the Introspectable trait, e. g. to report size of an asset. This UI is very basic currently, but that works for debugging:"
1767,Throw runtime errors at import time for failed resolution (#14),"Ported from https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/pull/521 Partially addresses https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/issues/249. Resolves https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/issues/527. This inserts code to throw an error at runtime when an unresolvable reference is encountered, at its time of import. This means that code referencing symbols from the import is unreachable. Additionally, I modeled this after what webpack currently does, and the same error-generating expression is generated at each site the symbol is referenced. Other options include:  Continue leaving undefined in their place, as they are not reachable anyway and this won't impact the running app. Looks clearly wrong, even if it is never run Leave behind the original identifier name (i.e. the given name of the default import or named imports) Don't generate any further code past the import site This feels clean, but I'm guessing it might be surprising to folks grepping in generated bundles not to find their original code there (even if it would never be run with a failing resolution).  Test Plan: * Added snapshot test * Ran snapshot test and verified Error: Cannot find module 'does-not-exist/path' is thrown, and nothing else is logged to the console.

1854,CSS modules shim (#490),"At the moment, whenever SSR encounters a CSS module, it will likely crash with the following error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someClassName') This is because CSS module support is currently unimplemented. In order to surface other potential errors while waiting on CSS modules implementation, I've implemented a Proxy-based shim that will always return a string whenever a CSS module export object is indexed. There are known issues with this implementation:  Only .module.css files should be considered CSS modules and EcmascriptChunkPlaceable; Could have used embed_file!  But since this is intended as a temporary workaround, it's probably good enough. An example error this helped surface: we currently don't expose a polyfill for fetch in Node.js (https://cs.github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/3d499a627f49b911b30120df4e2e39e998d6273b/packages/next/server/node-polyfill-fetch.js?q=fetch#L10)"

1856,Added explainer on environment variables (#2115),
1857,Make embed_file relative to package instead of invoker file (#484),"This makes the argument to embed_file! relative to the package it is invoked from, instead of relative to the file it is invoked from. The latter is closer to how include_*! works, but it has a couple of issues: * Since file! returns a path relative to the workspace, it requires knowing the full path to the workspace. However, this is undefined when the package is compiled from outside of the workspace (e.g. as a dependency of another package). * Procedural macros don't have access to the path of the file where they were originally invoked (although we could get it with #[feature(proc_macro_span)]), which means that an embed_dir macro would not be able to be relative to the invoker file anyway. So this makes things more consistent for such a (to be implemented) macro."

1861,Misc changes to memory backend (#472)," Takes advantage of HashSets instead of Vecs for collections, since a TaskId could be seen multiple times Avoids several CountHashSet->Vec->CountHashSet round trips during recursive read_collectibles Moves taking collectibles into the backend, so that it can be performed before the state lock is released.  This alone doesn't solve my issue with logging. No matter what changes I've tried to the backend (children scopes crawling, collating into a CountHashSet during reads (because items could be very negative but still have a single positive elsewhere stack)), I constantly see the same message over and over. I now think it's because the turbopack-dev-server is spawning new root tasks everytime it receives a network request. That root task is completely divorced from prior executions, so every time we've un-emitted, it's just re-emitted during the computation of the new root task's subtasks. I think we need to invert the network-handler -> turbo-tasks nesting to be turbo-tasks -> network-handler, with a persistent root task."

Always displays the description This used to be hidden behind the --detail flag Always displays the code frame of the issue, if it exists This used to be hidden behind the --detail flag Fixes the context (file path) to display the relative path to the file It was hardcoded to the FS string used by turbotrace Creates a new detail function which can provide debug-level information about the internal Rust state This is not shown by default, user must pass --detail flag  The format for a rendered issue roughly matches: ${SEVERITY} [${CATEGORY}]   ${CONTEXT}     ${TITLE}     ${CODE FRAME}     ${DESCRIPTION}     ${DETAIL} Where - SEVERITY is error/warning/etc - CATEGORY is a self-defined string for the phase of the compiler (eg, ""parsing"", ""running"") - CONTEXT is a file path to the offending file - TITLE is a short (single-line) title - CODE_FRAME is an optional position that generated the issue, which will display a few context lines and highlight the offending span of code - DESCRIPTION is a longer (multi-line) message that describes the issue, and what to do about it - DETAIL is a (by default not shown) fully detailed, debug-level, message providing insights into the internal state of Rust"

There's a lot of stuff in there so the second option is probably best."

I've created issues for these for now. One issue remaining is that renaming pages/_app.js does not switch to the default _app asset. The server needs to be restarted for this to happen. Similarly, adding an _app.js file does not switch from the default asset to it.

The regex used to identify casts, of which, 100% have been manually reviewed: turbopath\.(Absolute|Anchored|Relative)(Unix|System)Path\( Of the remaining 13 that do not fall into the above ""string"" or t.TempDir() exceptions, 7 fall outside of the fs package: turbopath\.(Absolute|Anchored|Relative)(Unix|System)Path\((?!(""|t\.TempDir)) ``` 7 results - 4 files cli/internal/cache/cache_http.go:   280       // FIXME: THIS IS A BUG.   281:      restoredName := turbopath.AnchoredUnixPath(hdr.Name)   282       files = append(files, restoredName.ToSystemPath()) cli/internal/hashing/package_deps_hash_test.go:   20    cwd, _ := os.Getwd()   21:   root := turbopath.AbsoluteSystemPath(filepath.VolumeName(cwd) + string(os.PathSeparator))   22:   checking := turbopath.AbsoluteSystemPath(cwd)   23   32            for _, file := range files {   33:               fileName := turbopath.RelativeSystemPath(file.Name())   34                if strings.Index(fileName.ToString(), fmt.Sprintf(""%02d-"", id)) == 0 {   35:                   return turbopath.AbsoluteSystemPath(fixtureDirectory.Join(fileName))   36                } cli/internal/lockfile/berry_lockfile.go:   305       if isPatch && !strings.HasPrefix(patchPath, ""~"") && !_builtinRegexp.MatchString(patchPath) {   306:          patches = append(patches, turbopath.AnchoredUnixPath(patchPath))   307       } cli/internal/lockfile/pnpm_lockfile.go:   251   for _, patch := range p.PatchedDependencies {   252:      patches[i] = turbopath.AnchoredUnixPath(patch.Path)   253       i++ ``` Of these 7: - One is a bug resolved by cache-to-tar. - Four are in a single test utility function. That should get cleaned up but is very low priority. - Two are in application code for berry and pnpm patches. I'll pass that off to @chris-olszewski since I'm not 100% certain that I can safely slap turbopath.AnchoredUnixPathFromUpstream() on them."

Thankfully, we can include a sourceMappingUrl comment in the evaled code, so we can get away with deferring creating the source map's content until dev tools is opened.

This is required as workspace dependencies don't appear in packages in the pnpm lockfile format. Taking a quick look at the npm lockfile format, this additional information will be helpful when implementing npm prune so it seems sensible to make this addition. The current implementation of copying dependency patches copies all patches instead of those that are strictly necessary. This was done due to the fact that pnpm duplicates patch info in package.json and in order to only copy the necessary patches we would first need to learn how to prune package.json. This should be done in the future, but is outside of the scope of this fix.   fix pruning of importers   fix copy patches during pruning   force paths to use unix style paths for pnpm workspace packages   address review feedback, fixup path types "
2060,Source Map cleanups and optimizations (#369),avoid temporary string allocations and remove some unused code
2061,Add source map support to ecmascript (#348),"Adds an optional source_map method to the Asset trait, which will be used to provide debugging maps. We expect that the source map will be requested from the base asset's path appended with a .map, eg foo.js -> foo.js.map are paired. I've chosen to implement the source maps using a ""sectioned"" source map (n√©e index map). This is by far the most efficient way to concatenate the source maps for multiple source files together, because it doesn't require us to modify the source map of an individual section at all. Coupled with the (IMHO) subpar API provided by the sourcemap crate, this is essentially the only good choice (we could VLQ encode -> stringify -> parse -> VLQ decode -> adjust -> VLQ encode -> stringify, but that's gotta be slower‚Ä¶). While unusual in the dev ecosystem, it's fully supported by all the browsers and we're targeting a dev server as the initial use case, so it works out well. This also introduces a CodeBuilder, which allows us to concatenate real source files (with source maps) with injected runtime code, preserving the offset positions for the source maps.

2064,Add ability to define a globalEnv key in turbo.json (#1950),"This simplifies the globalDependencies key, so it can only be responsible for file declarations and not need a microsyntax for env vars ($ prefixes)."
2065,Add ability to declare a env key in each pipeline task (#1970),"The env key takes on some of the responsibilities of the dependsOn config key, but notably does not accept strings that start with ""$"". The goal of this change is to separate file dependencies from environmental dependencies, so we can continue to improve cache partitioning."
2066,No shallow checkout for linting. (#1972),
2067,Improve CI setup (#1904),"Changes the CI setup to:  Extract Go and node setup to a ""composite"" action, allowing us to  setup all CI jobs consistently. For example, the golangci-lint was building   turbo with Go 1.17, while the Go unit and e2e tests were building with Go 1.18.  Parallelize some jobs for faster feedback  Separates Go unit and e2e tests, and JS lint and tests into separate workflows.   The tradeoff is that each Github Action runner will need to install Go and Node and   build turbo multiple times, but this is fairly fast, and these steps are highly cacheable.  Improve the names of Workflows, Jobs, and Steps to be more debuggable  Some of the naming changes are for consistency, but some make it easier to   scan the list of PR checks and the Action summaries to see what failed and where.   In some cases, the names of Steps are removed, as the command itself is descriptive   enough, that we do not need to name it. Co-authored-by: Nathan Hammond nathan.hammond@vercel.com"

2072,increase benchmark timeouts to be able to benchmark larger module counts (#362),
2073,Add basic .devcontainer.json and Dockerfile (#359),"This checks in a basic .devcontainer.json and Dockerfile, allowing VSCode [0], GitHub codespaces [1] (not tested), and a general-purpose cli [2] (also not tested) to provision an environment for building and testing turbopack in an automated way. This allowed me to quickly test under Linux, and might be helpful to folks testing Linux while developing on Windows (cc @sokra). It also includes Chromium, allowing us to test things like benchmarks which use headless Chromium. Turborepo also uses devcontainers, though I'm not sure how extensively in development. [3] This uses Debian ~Testing~Stable (""bullseye""). I wanted to use the latest Ubuntu LTS to match what we use in GitHub actions, but unfortunately Chromium is only distributed there as a snap package, and using only apt simplified the Dockerfile. Test Plan: * Set up remote development in containers in VSCode [4]  * Chose ""Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"" and selected turbo-tooling * Ran cargo test --benches -p next-dev inside the container and confirmed success [0] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers [1] https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/introduction-to-dev-containers [2] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli [3] https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/232643c3d1890261c51072180389cd6cd05a534c/.devcontainer [4] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial"

If we consider data to be the cached output of getStaticProps (in the future, as this is not yet implemented), this logic should be adapted."

2078,switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing (#1893),Start using the go-yarnlock package for parsing and encoding yarn lockfiles. We're doing this as this implementation is mostly a copy of the JS based yarn lockfile marshalling code. The code this is replacing was a mix sloppy mix of regex and post-processing. For testing I added some unit tests around parsing/encoding and ran turbo prune on the repo produced by npm create-turbo and running yarn dev on the resulting pruned project. Commits squashed: * switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing   run go mod tidy to fixup deps   handle windows style newlines   fix lint and simplify entry splitting   address typos   more robust handling of crlf

2081,docs(running tasks): explicit instruction for workspace tasks (#1922),"After a couple of hours of debugging why my workspace-specific task wasn't running, I realised I wasn't using the correct name in place of <workspace> so Turborepo never ran my workspace-specific task: before: json {   ""build"": {},   ""app-one#build"": {},   ""app-two#build"": {} } after: json {   ""build"": {},   ""@my-org/app-one#build"": {},   ""@my-org/app-two#build"": {} } I realise that his might seem like a silly mistake, however since the pnpm and turbo commands allow for 'implicit' filtering using a partial name, e.g. by using pnpm --filter=app-one or turbo run --filter=app-one, I was kind of primed to setup my workspace specific task in the same way, even though the package name was actually @my-org/app-one. Since this was not mentioned explicitly anywhere, it took me way too long to figure out my mistake. This change to the docs might help others not make the same mistake in the future.

However, what if your API is only returning a subset of the data (such as the mutated part), that can be populated into the cache? Usually, an extra revalidation after that mutation is needed. But now you can also use a function as `populateCache` to transform the mutate result into the full data:  ```js await mutate(addTodo(newTodo), {   optimisticData: [...data, newTodo],   rollbackOnError: true,   populateCache: (addedTodo, currentData) => {     // `addedTodo` is what the API returns. It's not     // returning a list of all current todos but only     // the new added one.     // In this case, we can transform the mutate result     // together with current data, into the new data     // that can be updated.     return [...currentData, addedTodo];   },   // Since the API already gives us the updated information,   // we don't need to revalidate here.   revalidate: false, }); ```  The new definition:  ```ts populateCache?: boolean | ((mutationResult: any, currentData: Data) => Data) ```  Here is a demo for it: https://codesandbox.io/s/swr-basic-forked-hi9svh  ##### Bug Fixes  #### What's Changed  -   refactor: revalidateIfStale has an effect on updates, not only mounting by [@‚Äãkoba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1837](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1837) -   fix: reset stale unmountedRef in suspense by [@‚Äãpromer94](https://togithub.com/promer94) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1843](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1843) -   test: add a test for the behavior of revalidateOnMount when the key has been changed by [@‚Äãkoba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1847](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1847) -   feat: Support `populateCache` as a function by [@‚Äãshuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1818](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1818)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2  ### [`v1.2.1`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.2.1)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)  #### Highlights of This Release  ##### `shouldRetryOnError` accepts a function  Previously [`shouldRetryOnError`](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/error-handling#error-retry) is either true or false. Now it accepts a function that conditionally determines if SWR should retry. Here's a simple example:  ```js const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => {   // Fetcher throws if the response code is not 2xx.   if (!res.ok) throw res   return res.json() })  useSWR(key, fetcher, {   shouldRetryOnError: (error) => {     // We skip retrying if the API is returning 404:     if (error.status === 404) return false     return true   } }) ```  Thanks to [@‚Äãsairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) for contributing!  #### What's Changed  -   `shouldRetryOnError` accepts a function that can be used to conditionally stop retrying   by [@‚Äãsairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816) -   build(deps-dev): bump next from 12.0.8 to 12.0.9 by [@‚Äãdependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1821](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1821) -   fix: useSWRInfinite revalidates with revalidateOnMount by [@‚Äãkoba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1830](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1830)  #### New Contributors  -   [@‚Äãsairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1  ### [`v1.2.0`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.2.0)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.1.2...1.2.0)  #### Highlights of This Release  ##### Optimistic Updates with Auto Error Rollback  There are now some new options in `mutate`:  ```js mutate(patchUser(user), {   optimisticData: user,   populateCache: true,   rollbackOnError: true,   revalidate: true, }) ```  Here the cache will be immediately updated to `user`, the ‚Äúoptimistic value‚Äù. And then a request (remote mutation) is started via `patchUser(user)` and the response will be written to the cache. If that request fails, the original result will be rolled back safely so the optimistic value will be gone. And after all those finish, a revalidation will start to fetch the latest value.  This is extremely helpful for building the optimistic UI pattern.  You can do the same for the global `mutate`, just remember to pass the key. Also, the current `mutate` APIs stay unchanged so `mutate(data, false)` works the same.  Here's an example: https://codesandbox.io/s/swr-basic-forked-k5hps.  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3676859/151381238-f3aba769-91b6-4bfc-9285-df1b9ef51773.mp4  ##### `.mjs` Support  SWR now has `.mjs` exported for bundlers that prefer this format.  This doesn‚Äôt break environments that don‚Äôt support `.mjs`. An alternative `.esm.js` and CJS bundle are also published.

Previously it uses the initial snapshotted fetcher.  ##### Avoid Unnecessary Auto Revalidations  When refocusing on the window with state changes (like clicking a button that changes the SWR key immediately), SWR now avoids revalidations if they're not necessary. Details can be found in [#‚Äã1720](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/issues/1720).  ##### New Types for `useSWRInfinite`  Two types for `useSWRInfinite` are added: `SWRInfinteHook` and `SWRInfinteKeyLoader`. You can use them to type the hook and the `getKey` function.  ##### New `populateCache` option for `mutate`  A new option to control if the mutation data should be written to the cache.

2184,chore(deps): update dependency esbuild to ^0.15.0 (#1848)," This PR contains the following updates: | Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence | |---|---|---|---|---|---| | esbuild | ^0.14.38 -> ^0.15.0 |  |  |  |  |  Release Notes  evanw/esbuild  ### [`v0.15.7`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#‚Äã0157)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.6...v0.15.7)  -   Add `--watch=forever` to allow esbuild to never terminate ([#‚Äã1511](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1511), [#‚Äã1885](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1885))      Currently using esbuild's watch mode via `--watch` from the CLI will stop watching if stdin is closed. The rationale is that stdin is automatically closed by the OS when the parent process exits, so stopping watch mode when stdin is closed ensures that esbuild's watch mode doesn't keep running forever after the parent process has been closed. For example, it would be bad if you wrote a shell script that did `esbuild --watch &` to run esbuild's watch mode in the background, and every time you run the script it creates a new `esbuild` process that runs forever.      However, there are cases when it makes sense for esbuild's watch mode to never exit. One such case is within a short-lived VM where the lifetime of all processes inside the VM is expected to be the lifetime of the VM. Previously you could easily do this by piping the output of a long-lived command into esbuild's stdin such as `sleep 999999999 | esbuild --watch &`. However, this possibility often doesn't occur to people, and it also doesn't work on Windows. People also sometimes attempt to keep esbuild open by piping an infinite stream of data to esbuild such as with `esbuild --watch /` where `` is an integer must be treated as if they were `n` times the `..` operator instead (the `` path segment is ignored). So `/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js` maps to the underlying file `/path/to/project/../../foo.js`. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.          However, old versions of Yarn used to use `$$virtual` instead of `__virtual__`. This was changed because `$$virtual` was error-prone due to the use of the `$` character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.      -   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories          The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.      These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.  ### [`v0.15.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#‚Äã0150)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.54...v0.15.0)  **This release contains backwards-incompatible changes.** Since esbuild is before version 1.0.0, these changes have been released as a new minor version to reflect this (as [recommended by npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/)). You should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `~0.14.0`. See the documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.  -   Implement the Yarn Plug'n'Play module resolution algorithm ([#‚Äã154](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/154), [#‚Äã237](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/237), [#‚Äã1263](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1263), [#‚Äã2451](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2451))      [Node](https://nodejs.org/) comes with a package manager called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which installs packages into a `node_modules` folder. Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within `node_modules`, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). While Yarn can install packages using `node_modules`, it also offers a different package installation strategy called [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp/), which is often shortened to ""PnP"" (not to be confused with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is an entirely different unrelated package manager).      Plug'n'Play installs packages as `.zip` files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read `./some.zip/lib/file.js` actually automatically extracts `lib/file.js` from `./some.zip` at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system.      Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the [`@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@‚Äãyarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp) plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a `.zip` file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside `.zip` files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API).      With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a `.pnp.js`, `.pnp.cjs`, or `.pnp.data.json` file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need `@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp` anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as `module` and `browser` in `package.json` files within `.zip` files should now be respected.      Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find `--log-level=verbose` helpful.

My first reaction was to try to minimize the lifetime of the WriteGuard in add_to_scope_internal_shallow to avoid contention. However, it's unclear whether it's lock contention that's causing the slowdown, or if it's just the locking/unlocking mechanism of std::sync::RwLock itself. Instead, I switched to parking_lot::RwLock, and instantly noticed great improvements.

2221,Move fs.AbsolutePath to turbopath.AbsolutePath (#1779),This PR does a few things: 1. Moves fs.AbsolutePath to turbopath.AbsolutePath. 2. (temporarily) Duplicates some utils and constants from fs into turbopath/absolute_path.go to prevent cycles. These will be removed in a followup commit. 3. (in a separate commit) \b(fs\.)?AbsolutePath\b => turbopath.AbsolutePath. (excluding the turbopath folder) The goal here is to make what are sweeping changes to the codebase still feel as incremental as possible. The next increment is turbopath.AbsolutePath to turbopath.AbsoluteSystemPath by combining the files and fixing the expectations of method calls throughout the codebase.
2222,(refactor) add lockfile abstraction (#1789),"This PR introduces a new lockfile abstraction that will allow us to easily add more lockfile support to other package managers. It also  Notable changes:  - Context now stores the lockfile interface instead of a yarn specific lockfile  - PackageJson now only stores the package names as they appear in the lockfile, these will be mapped to their entries when the pruned lockfile is created  - The initial implementation would cache the processed version of the yarn lockfile and attempt to use it. I did some light testing and I don't think this has a significant perf hit since the processing is straightforward. From my understanding of Golang I think having Lockfile as an interface makes sense since each package manager has a different data layout for their lockfile e.g. pnpm has 6 top level entries and yarn's top level entries are the package entries themselves. Testing: The e2e tests cover yarn prune, but I also tested that prune produces the an identical lockfile before and after these changes on a repo created with npx create-turbo."

2232,fix: use docker cache best practices in examples (#1673),"The whole purpose of the turbo prune --docker is to use docker caching best practices while the Docker examples do not follow these bests practices.    Plus, I believe that the first stage of the Dockerfile is wrong as it copies the whole project and defeats the entire purpose of the caching because the first layer never gets cached. I believe the most optimized solution is to run the turbo prune before the docker build on the machine that runs the docker build and set the out directory as the docker build context.   I understand that showing this approach may not be possible in the example, so I suggest we add a comment to the first stage with the above explanation."

2247,HMR support + React Refresh (#252),"This PR implements HMR support with React Refresh built-in. For now, in order for React Refresh to be enabled, you'll need the @next/react-refresh-utils package to be resolveable: yarn add @next/react-refresh-utils in your app folder.  Depends on #266  Integrated both HMR-and-React-Refresh-specific logic directly into the ES chunks' runtime. Webpack has more complex setup here, but for now this makes the logic much more easy to follow since everything is in one place. I have yet to implement the ""dependencies"" signature for hot.accept/hot.dispose, since React Refresh does not depend on them. We'll have to see if they're even used in the wild or if we should deprecate them. Only implemented the module API, not the management API. We apply all updates as soon as we receive them. Added support for ""runtime entries"" to ES chunks. These are assets that will be executed before the main entry of an ES chunk. They'll be useful for polyfills in the future, but for now they're here to evaluate the react refresh runtime before any module is instantiated.  Next steps for HMR: * Implement CSS HMR * Implement (or decide to deprecate) the dependencies form of hot.accept/hot.dispose * Clean up runtime.js some more: switch to TypeScript, split into multiple files, etc. It'd be nice if all of this could be done at compile time, but how to achieve this is unclear at the moment. Can we run turbopack to compile turbopack?"

The skinny loader chunk is shipped in the same chunk that uses dynamic import() expression. Its responsibility is to load the fat loader chunk from the server. The dynamic import has been rewritten to load this skinny chunk item, which will load the fat chunk from the server, which will load all the chunks needed by the dynamic import. Finally, we'll be able to load the module we're trying to dynamically import. Splitting the dynamic import into a quickly generatable skinny chunk item and a slow to generate fat chunk item allows for faster incremental compilation. The traversal won't be performed until the dynamic import is actually reached, instead of eagerly as part of the chunk that the dynamic import appears in."

2288,fix(cli): fallback to manual hashing for global (#1747),
2289,Implement snapshot tests (#241),"This implements snapshot testing, which writes all chunks to the filesystem. Hopefully these'll be a little quicker to test than the evaluation tests, which require us to spin up a browser to execute. The snapshots will detect if a file is expected (in the output dir) but it's not output by turbopack, if a file is output but was not expected, or if the contents has changed. It also supports a TURBOPACK_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 env, which will pass all tests, update all files to the latest outputs, and delete any files that shouldn't exist. The test structure follows a */*/input directory structure. Eg, large-feature-group ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ explicit-feature     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input     ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js     ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ any-other-files...     ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/...     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ snapshot_large_feature_group_explicit_feature_input_index.js         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ snapshot_large_feature_group_explicit_feature_input_node_modules_foo_index.js.js The */*/output is the output chunks we expect turbopack to generate. A few things are still left todo: - Diffing of the files isn't supported, which would be very helpful for finding changes. - I didn't handle static assets, and CSS could be broken. - It only supports index.js as the entry point, but we should support many entrypoints (and different filenames and extensions) via an options.json. - We only perform Browser transformations, but we should support any via an options.json. - I don't know if a nested directory structure is possible for output chunks, so it only supports output/* files."
2290,Move parent_path into FileSystemPathVc (#265),"This moves FileSystem::parent_path (which takes a FileSystemPathVc) to be directly on FileSystemPathVc. There's already a FileSystemPathVc::parent method which internally calls FileSystem::parent_path with self, which seems to be an indirect way to implement this. With the new method location, we're able to take advantage of FileSystemPathVc::new_normalized to skip some unnecessary work. And we also reduce duplication, there were two nearly identical implementations of parent_path between DevServerFileSystem and DiskFileSystem."

When the first asset won't be lazy it would compile all pages initially. In future we could add a new_prefetch constructor that adds the root asset to the expanded set which would allow to prefetch that. This would make sense for the / page."

There may also be an issue where tests are using the same directory to write node_modules and when running in parallel are erroring out.

2332,fix consistency issues (#224),There are a bunch or problems with invalidations:  The fs impl watches path case-insenstive. This means two paths might conflict when on a case-sensitive filesystem. It uses an array of Invalidators now Move the next-dev bootstrapping logic out of the run_once scope (which is not updated when invalidations occur). Instead it's executed inside the request handling resp. update stream where changes can be handled. TransientValue was not an Value type actually. This fixes that. Adds a new TransientInstance wrapper to pass transient by reference. strongly_consistent was broken when using nested TaskScopes. This fixes that.

Notable things:   Installs yarn and disables corepack as part of the test suite. This     is the pristine state we want for the tests that exist today. For     future tests cases that have a different setup, we may need to     modify this more.   Disables Windows tests. This yarn setup on Windows does not seem to     work, but this gets us one step forward. "
2337,add basic next pages support (#223),"Server Rendering:  This adds an additional ContentSource to next-dev which takes care of handling the pages directory. The content source creates a ServerRenderedAsset from each file in the src/pages or pages directory and a AssetGraphContentSource for that. The ServerRenderedAsset will reference an underlying asset for the node.js context which will be passed to the node executable for rendering. It uses a WrapperAsset to add additional communication logic.  Client Transition:  When annotating imports with transition: ""next-client"" the NextClientTransition is used This transition changes the environment to browser It wraps the referenced asset with a next-hyrdation wrapper asset It leaves a little module in the previous context which exports a list of URLs for chunks needed. The NextClientTransition takes a client_chunking_context as argument which specifies how the client code is chunked."
2338,output to terminal when we are just waiting for cache uploads (#1686),"As a stopgap before we move cache uploads to the daemon, I added some terminal output if uploading is blocking process completion.

Since we were only upgrading corepack in order to avoid #110 which only happens the first time a user sets up a package manager on a machine, I think this an acceptable regression in order to unblock development.

Version is a trait, so VersionVc can contain a specific version implementation by asset type. This is particularly important because...  A VersionedContentVc can be diffed with a VersionVc from the same underlying VersionedContent type with content.update(from: version). This returns an UpdateVc which describes the steps necessary to update from one verson to the next. In the case of ES chunks, this will be a map of added, and modified module IDs, with their respective factories, and a set of deleted module IDs. Implement diffing for ES chunks."

Fixes #204  Currently it: * Discovers integration test fixtures from the filesystem. Right now these are expected to be single files that get bundled and will eventually include assertions. This is powered by the test-generator crate, which allows us not to have to manually enumerate each case. We could consider using this for the node-file-trace tests as well. * Starts the dev server on a free port and opens a headless browser to its root. The browser control is implemented with the https://crates.io/crates/chromiumoxide crate, which expects Chrome or Chromium to already be available. Eventually it will: * [x] Implement a minimal test environment loaded in the browser so that assertions can be run there from bundled code. * [x] Report back the results of these assertions to rust, where we can pass/fail cargo tests with those results. In the future it could: * Possibly include snapshot-style tests to assert on transformed results. This could be in the form of fixture directories instead of files cc @jridgewell * Support expressing special configuration of turbopack in a fixture, possibly as another file in the fixture directory. * [x] ~Possibly support distributing tests to a pool of open browsers instead of opening and closing for each test.~ Test Plan: See next PRs"

The take variant will stop bubbling and parent tasks will not see these values. You may re-emit them via emit() again. Peeking is a bit more efficient. Emitting is pretty cheap. Peeking and taking is counted as read operation and the task will invalidate when new values are emitted or existing ones are removed.

2426,Custom debug implementation for Vcs (#193),"This PR builds our own Debug-like derive-macro machinery for formatting structs, relying on std::fmt::Formatter for the actual formatting. Usage A new ValueDebug trait is automatically implemented for all #[turbo_tasks::value]s, which has a single .dbg() method which resolves to a debug representation that can then be printed to the screen. #[turbo_tasks::value_trait] also implement the .dbg() method directly. rust dbg!(any_vc.dbg().await?); If you have a #[turbo_tasks::value] struct with a field that doesn't implement Debug, you'll want to declare that field as #[debug_ignore]. For instance: ```rust [turbo_tasks::value(ContentSource, serialization: none, eq: manual, cell: new, into: new)] pub struct TurboTasksSource {     #[debug_ignore]     #[trace_ignore]     pub turbo_tasks: Arc>, } ``` Why not use Debug directly? We can't use Debug because our values are resolved asynchronously and can nest Vcs arbitrarily. I tried using futures::executor::block_on to resolve them synchronously in a Debug implementation but that causes deadlocks."

2452,fix: modern yarn lockfile parsing error (#1597),"Description The header string written to the pruned lockfile by the turbo prune command starts each of the metadata fields at the beginning of a line. This causes the __metadata, version, and cache_key fields to be parsed as separate fields, when really the version and cache_key should be nested within __metadata.  This silently causes the yarn cache to miss on every dependency without throwing an error. Fixing this line drastically improves dependency install times for pruned workspaces when the cache exists. Additionally, turbo throws an error here when running a yarn workspaces focus my-app install afterwards due to the un-nested metadata: ERROR  yarn.lock: could not unmarshal lockfile: yaml: unmarshal errors: -- ¬† | ¬† | line 5: cannot unmarshal !!int `5` into fs.LockfileEntry ¬† | ¬† | line 6: cannot unmarshal !!int `8` into fs.LockfileEntry Solution Because the yamlEncoder sets the indent to two, adding two spaces before each of the fields should make this valid syntax.

This moves browser opening from the turbopack-dev-server crate into the next-dev crate, which has the cli entrypoint that runs the dev server. It looks like the dev server package is meant to be used as a library (it's only a library crate), and having this external side effect feels unexpected and makes it difficult to use this crate in situations like a test runner for next-dev, where we should test with a headless web browser. Alternatively, opening the browser could be an option passed when creating the dev server, but this feels a bit cleaner to me. Test Plan: cargo run -p next-dev and verify the browser still opens and successfully connects to the dev server."

2792,Label root package in dependency graph (#1491),"Fixes #1333  Previously, our package dependency graph used whatever name the root package.json had. This PR changes it to always use our internal root-package token (//). This lets us reference the root package later in the process and properly work out dependency- / dependent-relationships that include the root package. Unfortunately, we don't yet have the infrastructure for unit testing this part of the code. We'll likely need to break apart context.go a bit more before it's really tractable. Verified experimentally using the repo in the linked issue."

Instead, read it on demand in run and prune  * Behavioral change: running turbo in a directory w/o a turbo.json will no longer immediately error, so we can display usage / help information. package.json is, however, still required as of this change. Notes on future work: prune requires TurboJSON because context.WithGraph requires it. But WithGraph only needs it to construct the global hash value, which isn't needed for constructing the package-dependency graph. If migrate calculateGlobalHash to its own top-level function, I think prune won't need turbo.json at all."

2868,fix(cli): cache with correct file perms (#1429),"Fixes https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/156 Issue Summary There were two main issues causing this:   We're using generic filesystem function for the cache operations. These functions require a file mode for the source file, and a file mode for the destination file. We were setting the incorrect bit here causing all files to be restored from cache with one file mode.    When recursively walking files, the walk function we use seems to be calling the callback with the incorrect file mode (it's always 0)   The Fix To fix this, I've made the file copying functions a bit less generalized (they no longer require a source mode, or a destination mode). Instead, they always use the mode of the source file for the destination file. I also pushed the logic of sourcing the source files mode into the Copy function, below where the incorrect mode was being returned from godirwalk. This makes these functions slightly less reusable, but for our purposes, this is what we need. We can always add back generalized versions in the future."

2970,Configure Dependabot (#1365),"This PR configures Dependabot to monitor dependencies across all of our own packages.

Note: Dependabot does not officially support pnpm (dependabot/dependabot-core#1736) and is not workspaces-friendly (dependabot/dependabot-core#4993). All Dependabot PRs for the npm ecosystem will require checking out, regenerating the lockfile, and pushing back to the branch.

2984,"Added ""outputLogs"" Configuration Option (#1332)"," Added ""outputLogs"" To turbo.json  This commit adds a new configuration option ""outputLogs"" which will be used to set the default value of the --output-logs run option.  Refactored --output-logs Run Option  This commit refactors the task log output to use the new util.TaskOutputModeand removes the LogMode type used previously.   Added ""outputLog"" Tests   Added ""outputLogs"" Documentation   Simplified TaskOutputMode Constants   Changed TaskOutputMode Into Enum   This commit replaces the TaskOutputMode strings with an appropriate enum and related parsing. It now uses UnmarshalJSON to parse as well and so we can remove ValidateTurboJSON entirely.  Moved ""outputLogs"" Config Into Pipeline  This commit moves the root ""outputLogs"" configuration option into the pipeline config. It also renames it to ""outputMode"" to better reflect the nature of the option.   Fixed Accidental Changes   Removed More Unnecessary Changes   After scrolling through all of the changed files in GitHub, I found other instances of unnecessary changes. Since this PR went through a few iterations, some things were left behind that weren't necessary.   Added ""outputMode"" Parsing Test   Refactored TaskOutputModeOverride Into TaskCache   This removes the need to deal with strings outside of the ""--output-logs"" value handling.

2987,Log to temp files then rename (#1351),"Log files are hard-linked into the cache, so when re-running a task we need to ensure we don't pollute a previous run.  This changes our logging to stream to a temp file, which we then rename to the actual log file. This serves to break the hard link.  Note that:  * renames will succeed even if the target already exists, as long as the target isn't a directory. All of our targets are log files  * renames can fail if the rename is across filesystem boundaries. Our renames are within the same directory. Fixes #1323"

(#1339),The afero experiment was interesting but we have discovered that the package has significant deficiencies and many ecosystem projects (e.g. https://github.com/adrg/xdg) do not currently support virtual file systems. As this is not a primary portion of what we're focusing on we don't at this time see ROI from responsibility for trying to push our corner of the ecosystem in this direction. If we want to adopt something similar in the future we would consider https://github.com/avfs/avfs.

3018,Prevent side effects when looking for config files. (#1328),"As noted in https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/pull/1156#discussion_r863341102, xdg.ConfigFile has side effects. One of the consequences of the side effects is that sometimes, when simply wanting to check for existence, we would error out entirely because the path wasn't writable. This splits the process of creating and reading a config file path, which means that the error won't be encountered unless a user is explicitly trying to create a configuration file. (Which should be an error.) Fixes #1270"

For example: ```    TURBOREPO Welcome to Turborepo! Let's get you set up with a new codebase.    ? Where would you like to create your turborepo? ../../my-cool-repo ``` Will create a new turborepo at ../../my-cool-repo, and the package.json name will be: my-cool-repo; This is similar to how create-react-app and create-next-app work."

There is still a fair amount to be done to refactor prune, but this is a start that allows easier expansion of commandline configuration. Fixes #1258 Adds the feature requested in #1159 (flag for outputs of prune) Note that this PR stacks on top of porting over run"
3028,Port run to cobra (#1298),Removes some long-deprecated flags:  - serial  - includeDependencies  - cacheFolder
3029,Create noopCache to ensure that users always have a valid cache object. (#1317),"This makes it possible for a repository whose CI configuration is --remote-only to work when receiving pull-requests from forked repositories that do not have access to secrets configuration in CI. Example failures: - https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/pull/1302: Error - https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/7575: Error One example workaround: https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/7873 However, since this does not prevent the build from running to completion, I do not believe that it should be a hard error. While in the process of addressing this I also discovered that, since the httpCache can remove itself, there is an alternative path to triggering a panic if the httpCache is the only cache you have enabled and it removes itself. Using a noopCache as a cache of last resort (similar to the upstream solution) resolves both of these issues. Related to: #1169"

This caused us to copy their pointed-to contents as if the symlink was a directory, and then when copying the link itself, throw an error because it already existed (as a directory...). This in turn would crash all of our file-copying worker goroutines, leaving the main goroutine waiting indefinitely for file copying to complete. Not included here, but we should potentially make our file-copying goroutines more robust so that at the very least we get a better error message."

3076,Implement root tasks (#1040),"Adds the ability to run tasks from the root package.json file. Implementation notes that will need to be documented:  * Tasks run from the root are opt-in. That is, turbo.jsonmust have an entry for _root#<task> to enable running that task at the root.  * _root is available in filters, so turbo run my-task --filter=_root will run _root#my-task.   * If an entry exists in turbo.json for _root#task, then turbo run task will also run that task for the root.  * There is some best-effort cycle detection in place. If the root package.json has ""build"": ""turbo run build"", then even after opting in, turbo run build --filter=_root will produce an error. This cycle detection can be circumvented with aliases or other indirection used to run turbo.  * For the purposes of changed files, any changed file in a repo that doesn't belong to another package is considered to belong to the root.    * Note that this could cause frequent runs of root tasks if they are triggered from git changes. With inputs specified, they should hit cache if nothing relevant has changed. Additional changes:  * e2e tests now include a root task  * a package task is now sufficient to mark a particular task as runnable by turbo. e.g. if you defined foo#my-task but not my-task in turbo.json, previously running turbo run my-task would be an error, now it will run foo#my-task.

This is a nice isolated test of afero, which we can expand into the rest of the codebase if we remain happy with it. - Writes a bunch of tests of the globby implementation in order to attempt to specify the behavior prior to rewriting the implementation of GlobFiles. - Removes the implicit dependency on os.Getwd in one call to GlobFiles.

3294,Proposal for incremental path refactor (#995),"This PR is a proposal for how we can start to get a handle on the various kinds of paths that turbo uses. My goal is the following:  * Eventually ensure that an absolute, platform-dependent path is used any time we interact with the filesystem    * This will allow us to guarantee that we don't break --cwd, which is likely currently broken  * Eventually ensure that we can easily identify relative paths, both with respect to the monorepo root and to a particular package root  * Be incrementally adoptable. There is a huge amount of surface area to this change, so it's important to be able to tackle it a piece at a time  * Be auditable. The goal would be to eventually ban usage of path/filepath and a subset of os.* functions anywhere in the codebase outside path.go. It may even be possible to automate this in CI. Furthermore, entry points and exit points from our custom types (currently just AbsolutePath) are clearly marked, along with the intention of eventually migrating them, if appropriate (e.g. ToStringDuringMigration, UnsafeToAbsolutePath).  * New PRs that interact with the filesystem should use fs.AbsolutePath, even if they need to use one of the migration functions to facilitate that. Hopefully this will force both the submitter and reviewer to focus on ensuring that the new code will work properly with --cwd. I've done a few pieces of the migration to show what it would look like in the code base in a partially migrated state. path.go contains the AbsolutePath type, which ideally would be the sole way to interact with the filesystem. Please let me know what you think about the api and the migration overall."

The classic example is lint. If a depends on b, and b changes, that should no longer force a cache miss for a#lint, so long as the lint task has no dependencies.  Remaining work:  - [x] Update fallback for git ls-file to properly handle inputs  - [x] Add tests for inputs  - [x] Update global hash key (not technically necessary, but may be a good idea) Fixes #523"

3354,feat(colors): add options for forcing color/no-color,"This change checks for --color / --no-color as command-line arguments as a mechanism for forcing color in non-TTY situations, or forcing --no-color for TTY. Additionally, this change hooks into the FORCED_COLOR environment variable that is used by the supports-color npm package that is used by a variety of packages in the node ecosystem. The intention of this PR is to alleviate some of the concerns from Issue #897 by allowing users of turborepo to enable color output on CI runners such as Github Actions which support color output (as mentioned in the fatih/color documentation). With github actions and local builds are both running in color, then the cached output should be consistently in color, compared to the current situation where its a mix of color and non-color output with a remote shared between CI and users building interactively. The FORCED_COLOR environment variable is something that I find myself already setting when running turbo so that the streamed output is in color for the build and testing tools that I am running with it, so it seemed like a natural way to provide this argument without needing to modify the CLI parameters being passed to turbo. In the event multiple methods are being used, the precedence is: * isTTY or not (provided by fatih/color) * $NO_COLOR (if set, then color is disabled) * $FORCED_COLOR (""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""true"" will enable color, ""0"", or ""false"" will disable color) * --color/--no-color (the last argument wins if both exist)"

We're still matching the same hits and misses though.  * Start exercising --dry=json a little for testing purposes."

3483,Stop removing unreferenced packages before task graph construction (#918),"Fixes #912  In this PR:  * Stop removing unreferenced packages from the package dependency graph before building the task graph.  * Remove the implied --include-dependencies if --scope and --since are both set. It should no longer be necessary.  * Remove the test for --scope and --since implying --include-dependencies  * Add a new scheduler test that mimics the way run now behaves.  * Add a debugging profile for doing a dry run against the kitchen sink example. Future work includes being able to write a test in run_test.go to get the whole end-to-end graph build, but we don't quite have the infrastructure for that yet (also required for follow-on work to #911)  Note that this is technically a breaking change. Previously, if a depends on b, and the ""test"" task depends on ""^build"" the following would be true:  * turbo run test --scope=a would test a but not build b  * turbo run test --scope=a --include-dependencies would build b and test a AND b. With this change, turbo run test --scope=a will now build b and test a. The addition of tasks running for unselected packages is new. While this seems like more work being done, in practice I expect users to be able to move from the second example above to the first, ultimately resulting in less work being done: b#test will no longer need to run to get a#test to run."

It uses runtime.NumCPU() to get the number of available logical processors, and calculates from there. Setting the percentage to zero or less is an error. Setting percentage very low, to eg 1% results in always at least 1 as the value for concurrency."

In particular, these paths are coming from globby and don't pass through the normalization from the linked PR, so they are still os-dependent. I have encountered some problems with builds failing in GH Actions because dependencies that should have been built already were not found when I had previously built those projects on my windows machine. I believe this PR should fix the problem but I haven't had the chance to try reproducing the existing issue to verify that this fixes it. I might be able to get that done later today, but I wanted to get a PR up sooner rather than later"

As an example, say a depends on b, b depends on c. If b#build depends on c#some-task, and a#builddepends on^build`.  Currently, running a#build will do c#some-task, c#build, b#build, and a#build. But, we don't need c#build. We just need c#some-task, since that's what b#build depends on, and a doesn't really know anything about c directly, just via b. So, we instead just draw an edge to direct dependencies, and then let them sort out their own dependencies. For a large example, here are before and after graphs for running turbo run build in examples/kitchen-sink: Before:  After:  Also get rid of an unused field, taskDeps, on Scheduler."

To enable this, we store artifacts in the cache relative to the root of the monorepo (see screenshot) below for before (top) and after (bottom).  Since we are changing how cache is structured, I updated the global cache key in turbo in order to prevent prior old artifacts from ever ever being cache hits with after this change The only downside to this change, which might not be a downside at all, I guess, is possibility that artifacts are now tied to the directory structure of outputs relative to the root of the monorepo."

3586,feat(yarn-pnp): adding support for turbo run w/ yarn pnp (#797),"Regarding https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/693#issuecomment-1055497641 I believe this at least partially addresses Issue: #693, but the scope of the issue is unclear. More specifically this removes the general check for yarn pnp and moves it into the prune command instead as this is the part that likely has remaining issues with pnp since nothing else that I'm aware of needs to know about node_modules. This PR builds off of #795, as otherwise you can't even run turbo to be able to hit the previous nodeLinker checks. Let me know if you would like me to change things around so that it is more explicitly enabling for the run task as opposed to enabling for all but prune."
3587,Extract ResolvePackages (#830)," Move package resolution logic to scope package Remove unused functionality from SCM interface to make it easier to mock in tests Start adding tests for scope resolution  Review Note: scope_test.go provides examples of parsed flags and how they translate to packages considered in-scope. I've done my best to infer what packages should be built in each scenario, but please verify. Also very happy to accept additions to that test. Possibly controversial change: To maintain backwards compatibility, specifying --since and --scope to turbo run will imply --include-dependencies. This means that using scope will generally cause all dependencies of the specified scopes to be built, although the cache will still be used so this may potentially be cheap.  Previously, this behavior was triggered when --scope and --since constraints produced packages to be built. In cases where they were both specified but one or both did not produce packages to be built, dependencies were not included.  With this change, the behavior will be consistent based on commandline flags and default to building dependencies. With an upcoming switch over to cobra for commandline parsing, we should be able to flag off building dependencies if the user requests it."

3594,fix(peer-deps): don't consider peer deps when constructing graph (#813),"Splitting this out of #802. I tried this first when attempting to fix my own build issues in that PR after discovering Issue #407 which suggested peerDependencies might be the problem. It wasn't enough to solve the build hangs with my project, but seems to have its own merits. If a package has a peer dependency but there is no corresponding devDependency, then it should be presumed that there are no build-time dependency on that package. For example, if there was code that would be executed by one of the scripts that tried to import from the peer package, this would generally speaking fail to run, because node would be unable to resolve the dependency unless another package was pulling it in and it got hoisted, etc. Workspace dependencies are kind of a special case in that they won't be hoisted and can be resolved by node, but if you were to ever move that package out of the monorepo then that same situation as above would fail to build. As a result, my impression is that for any use-case where peerDependencies need to be explicitly part of the dependency graph is actually just a missing dependency declaration bug where that package should actually be part of the dev deps. I have also changed the order in which dependencies, optionalDependencies, and devDependencies are selected to match the order that lerna uses for cases where the package shows up in multiple places. See: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/a47fc294393a3e9507a8207a5a2f07648a524722/core/package-graph/index.js#L53-L58 The attached issues mentions making a flag to control this behavior, but given the reasoning above, I'm not sure if there is ever a situation where you would want to have a peer-dependency impact the dependency graph if its not also a regular or dev (or optional) dependency.

When turbo currently tries to build the dependency graph, it doesn't consider the specified version/range of the dependency, it just assumes that if that package name exists in the workspace it must be an internal dependency.

The intention is to separate out a few distinct pieces:  * The complete graph, inferred from the the filesystem and pipeline configuration. This should be reusable across multiple runs on the same filesystem / pipeline  * Run specific configuration: what tasks to run, whether to include dependencies, etc.  * The mechanics of how to execute the run. In parallel? Cache the output? etc. Review note: it may be easier to go commit by commit."

3713,Add schema.json to have a better IDE intellisense (#634),"This PR adds an schema.d.ts file with all (documented ones) properties in the turbo.json file. This way, and combining with the new npm run jsonschema script, it's possible to generate an Json schema file. I configured to the generated file be placed at docs/public/schema.json , so it can be requested from the url https://turborepo.org/schema.json. You can test how powerfull it is with in IDE autocompletion, intellisense and inline documentation. Try it out in your IDE by adding ""$schema"": ""./docs/public/schema.json""  It also updated all (that i saw :P) documentation examples to include the $schema property, this way, it will go by default for all Ctrl C/V users out there. But i still need to point out some things:  As the jsonschema (Is that even a good name?) script is going to be ran a lot, may we add ts-json-schema-generator to the devDependencies group? In the root turbo.json file, i saw an env property, but it is not documented, should i add it or it just shouldn't be there? I am not a native english speaker, even that i mostly copy pasted the tsdocs in the schema.d.ts file, it is not perfect and it probably has some typos.  That's it for now.
