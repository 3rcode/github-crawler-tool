8,Optional framework inference (#4788),This makes it possible to opt out of framework inference by specifying module on the command line. This is designed to interact gracefully with module as a separate-but-related knob to turn for control over environment variables.
9,Implement TaskInput derive macro (#4828),"This PR implements a module derive macro that allows users to define structures and enums that can be directly passed as arguments to modules, provided they are composed exclusively of other module implementors (i.e. primitives for which we've manually implemented module, modules, and other structs that derive module). There are a lot of cases in Turbopack where we'd like to pass more advanced structures to modules, but since there's no existing way to create composite structures and enums from existing modules and primitives, we end up with the following recurring patterns: Functions that have 6+ arguments For example: ```rust [turbo_tasks::function] fn do_something(a: A, b: B, c: C, d: D, e: E, f: F) {     // ... } ``` By creating composite structures with arguments that are often used together and passed down the call tree, this can instead become: ```rust [derive(TaskInput, Clone)] struct Args1 {     a: A,     b: B, } [derive(TaskInput, Clone)] struct Args2 {     c: C,     d: D,     e: E, } [turbo_tasks::function] fn do_something(args1: Args1, args2: Args2, f: F) {     // ... } ``` Multiple optional arguments ... where only specific combinations make sense. ```rust [turbo_tasks::function] fn do_something(value1: SomeVc, value2: Option, value3: Option) {     if let (Some(value2), Some(value3)) = (value2, value3) {         // ...     }     // ... } ``` In this example, module might only make sense when module is also provided. An enum would be better in this case: ```rust [derive(Clone, TaskInput) enum CustomEnum {   NoValues,   Values {     value2: OtherVc,     value3: AnotherVc,   } } [turbo_tasks::function] fn do_something(value1: SomeVc, values: CustomEnum) {     if let CustomEnum::Values { value2, value3 } = values {         // ...     }     // ... } ``` module and module For example: ```rust [turbo_tasks::value(serialization = ""auto_for_input"")] [derive(PartialOrd, Ord, Debug, Hash, Clone, Copy)] pub enum SomeArgument {     A,     B,     ... } // and then later some_function(Value::new(SomeArgument::B)) ``` This can now be replaced with: ```rust [derive(TaskInput, Clone)] pub enum SomeArgument {     A,     B,     ... } // and then later some_function(SomeArgument::B) ``` Apart from conciseness and fewer trait bounds, another benefit of this approach is that module cannot be (mis)used as a module, which we always generate via the module proc macro. How does it work? The derive macro generates code to convert enums and structs into a list of modules, similarly to how module was previously implemented for tuples. We use an additional integer discriminant to differentiate between enum variants. Concerns A potential concern of this approach is that these modules will be cloned on every single task execution. As such, they should be as lightweight as possible, and implement module where it makes sense. Testing Instructions I added a series of tests in turbo-tasks-memory. link WEB-945"
10,fix: no longer include peer dependencies in transitive closures (#4824),Description Fixes #4757 Underlying issue was I was including module in the dependency crawl. This resulted in an error since we expect to only be looking at external dependencies in the dependency crawl. Testing Instructions Added a failing unit test where there's a workspace that's used as a peer dependency that conflicts with a package in the registry.

30,Rust daemon v2 (#4791),"Description This reintroduces the rust daemon with some additional patches to help with some critical shortcomings of the initial canary. In short: - kqueue performance is pretty awful and would gladly pin a core on your CPU for multiple minutes while registering watchers. this is an opt-in feature on macOS so we dropped it in favour of fsevents - we didn't have timeouts for daemon interactions, meaning it would hang while waiting for the daemon to process a request. the timeout is now set to 1s - we had a few outstanding bugs With the above addressed, we are going to try another canary.

52,fix: berry prune including all builtin patch descriptors (#4770),"Description Addresses the issue @erj826 found in link The issue came from us including all descriptors for patches included in the pruned lockfile. This is fine for patches created by module since this uses module which results in the patch having a single descriptor. Yarn also includes link by default if they appear in your lockfile. These patches don't go through module and instead get routed through the link which produces a new descriptor for each descriptor used for the original package. The fix was to only include patch descriptors if the embedded descriptor is present in the pruned lockfile. Testing Instructions Added a new test fixture where multiple workspaces depend on module, but use different ranges."

54,Fix TSConfig extends pointing to node module (#4772),"In #4754, I screwed up the resolution logic for configs that reference another config inside a node module. In it, I incorrectly joined module before performing any lookup, because I thought the joining was happening in the module in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/611a912d/src/compiler/commandLineParser.ts#L3315. But, that combine has no real affect, it immediately gets stripped in a call to module in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/611a912d/src/compiler/moduleNameResolver.ts#LL1703C93-L1703. Instead, it performs a basic module lookup using the input module name, and even tries to load the file referenced at that location (eg, it's a module). If that fails, then it combines with an implied module the same way a module is appended when doing module. Fixes WEB-974"
55,Port RecursiveCopy to Rust (#4719),
56,fix: allow for workplace descriptors without a protocol (#4755),Description Fixes the issue found by @quinnturner in link. Crux of the issue was we were being too restrictive when tracking dependency protocols to properly infer them for later construction. We now allow for at most two descriptors in the protocol resolver: one without a protocol and one with a protocol. Another change was no longer adding all descriptors for a workspace and instead only including descriptors that come from other workspaces. Testing Instructions New testing fixture contains a lockfile where one workspace depends on another via module and the other depends on it via module.

74,Inline a constant so it's individualized to each task run (#4735),
75,Make sure that we only hash the env pairs. (#4708),"This corrects the hashing behavior for the global hash if there is an EnvMode specified. The struct now known as module contains additional data that is not required to be present in the hash; particularly that module should be module, not module. This didn't result in user-facing bugs, but it results in unnecessarily partitioned caches when using env modes. We can't hash what is now known as module directly, we must grab the components of it that we need, which this does for the (currently) two available hash formats."

86,feat: Use Rust Berry lockfile impl (#4684),"Description Built on top of #4629 Overview of changes: - ~~Change module so we calculate workspace's closure in parallel in a similar manner to Go~~ This had to get reverted, it appears that rayon was causing link  - module -> module makes this FFI call generic - Addition of an optional module map to the module and module, this is only used by Berry. In the ideal world this would be all of the root module, but serializing all of that via protobuf is overkill since berry is the only lockfile that needs that info and we only use that field. - Addition of module FFI function, this wasn't needed before as NPM doesn't have patch files encoded in the lockfile - Addition of module FFI function, previously for NPM we were just doing this in Go since there were just two fields we needed to check and parsing JSON is cheap. - Switches lockfile usage of berry from the Go implementation to the Rust one introduced in #4589 Reviewer notes: - The passing of the optional resolutions map is very icky and one off, but this is the only lockfile the requires additional information to properly parse. Once the package graph is squarely in Rust land this should go back to being more generic. This will finally close out #2791 Testing Instructions Added a new integration test that uses resolutions. This integration test invokes the new module FFI call. For a full test of the new resolution feature, clone and follow the instructions in the link The module integration tests all hit the new module FFI callsite and provide test coverage.

A quick sketch of the changes in this PR: - Moves the traversal of the lockfile to be the final step of building the package graph  - We now calculate all of the closures of all workspaces at once - Rust FFI now takes the package manager string to select the lockfile implementation. This is a quick prefactor to prepare for hooking up the berry lockfile Reviewer notes: - Each commit can be reviewed on it's own, the first commit ended up getting reverted down the stack so it can be skipped.

Context: https://vercel.slack.com/archives/C03EWR7LGEN/p1681789689115509 Currently all of the ecma transforms are explicitly listed under EcmaInputTransform in turbopack-ecmascript. This makes enum verbose, we have to manually expand it each time adding new transform, as well as turbopack-ecmascript gets larger to contain all of the 3rd party transforms by default. PR extracts non-core transforms into a new crate, named as ecmascript-plugins then utilize EcmaInputTransform::Custom to invoke transforms instead. module is renamed to module as well. Goal is extracting all of 3rd party / non-core transforms.

See the description of #2019 for an overview of the berry lockfile format. Note for reviewers: - I suggest reviewing module first as module, module, and module are the building blocks for most of the lockfile logic - We cannot use module for serialization as berry expects some strings to be quoted that are not necessarily required to be quoted by the YAML spec. - The underlying lockfile data is passed into the struct that contains the lockfile logic, this allows us to borrow from the data when building up the internal data structures. Down the road this could be changed to use module if this proves to be painful from an ergonomics perspective Testing Instructions Ported existing unit tests and added new ones for the resolutions logic.

174,add included metadata to chunks to allow deduplicate chunk loads at runtime (#4488),Description Chunk loading is now more than just a single chunk filepath. It might consist of additional metadata which tells the chunk loading logic the entry modules included in this chunk. This allows the runtime logic to avoid loading chunks when all entry modules are already loaded. This means loading the same chunk from multiple sources (with different available modules) will only trigger a single load and so avoids transferring more code than needed. This is especially relevant in app dir where every client component is considers as separate chunk loading. next.js: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/48025

176,fix: better support for pnpm aliases (#4555),"Description This is a follow up to #4541 that fixes the underlying issue. We now will attempt to return the extracted version instead of the full key when we encounter one. A quick explanation for how this happened is that when link are used the resolved version in the lockfile will be the full lockfile key instead of a version since the name won't match the specifier (e.g. module will have a version of module instead of just module). This is all fine unless an external dependency also depends on module then we get a dependency of module when going through the external dependency where we would get module going through the workspace with the alias. Testing Instructions Updated the unit test added in the initial PR to reflect that we're no longer getting a package with a version that's actually a lockfile key. This change also changes the test for pnpm overrides, but this change is more correct as we're now only returning the version.

Both of these use cases are a concern of the chunking context (i.e. it would differ between dev and build), hence they're now handled by the chunking context. Move the chunk list registration logic into a different chunk. The chunk list was previously a bit leaky as it required the Next.js code to instantiate it manually.

219,Deprecate module. (#4526),"This PR deprecates the use of module for cache partitioning.  The search string is module and can match things like module. Inferring env var inclusion based upon arbitrary substring inclusion regardless of position is too broad. (Should have been module.) Squatting on an env var string not scoped to module is (at least) not polite to the rest of the ecosystem. Using this feature makes it more-difficult to share caches across machines and create reproducible builds. Residual module variables from earlier arbitrary configuration can unnecessarily partition the cache. The interaction between this feature and ""strict"" environment variable mode introduces complexity where a user can't easily reason about the behavior. Should the module variable be included into the global hash if unspecified? Should the module variable pushed into the execution environment?  The original goal of this feature is to be able to quickly and dynamically change the hash key for a run. I find that the implicit nature is anathema to our goals. Previous use cases and recommendations: - Compare cache artifacts across multiple runs: use run summary or module. - Make sure everything runs: use module. - module is just a hardcoded env var. Add it to module under module instead.  Co-authored-by: Mehul Kar link"

There are also many new features, for example, **HTTP2 support** is finally live! :globe_with_meridians:  *If you find Got useful, you might want to [sponsor the Got maintainers](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got?sponsor=1).*  ***  #### Breaking changes  ##### Removed support for `electron.net`  Due to the inconsistencies between the Electron's `net` module and the Node.js `http` module, we have decided to officially drop support for it. Therefore, the `useElectronNet` option has been removed.  You'll still be able to use Got in the Electron main process and in the renderer process through the `electron.remote` module or if you use Node.js shims.  ##### The Pagination API is now stable  We haven't seen any bugs yet, so please give it a try! If you want to leave some feedback, you can do it [here](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1052). Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!  ```diff  { -    _pagination: {...} +    pagination: {...}  } ```  ##### API  - The `options.encoding` behavior has been reverted back to the Got 9 behavior.     In other words, the options is only meant for the Got promise API. To set the encoding for streams, simply call `stream.setEncoding(encoding)`.  ```diff -got.stream('https://sindresorhus.com', {encoding: 'base64'}); +got.stream('https://sindresorhus.com').setEncoding('base64');  // Promises stay untouched await got('https://sindresorhus.com', {encoding: 'base64'}); ```  - The error name `GotError` has been renamed to `RequestError` for better readability and to comply with the documentation.  ```diff -const {GotError} = require('got'); +const {RequestError} = require('got'); ```  - The `agent` option now accepts **only an object** with `http`, `https` and `http2` properties. While the `http` and `https` properties accept native `http(s).Agent` instances, the `http2` property must be an instance of [`http2wrapper.Agent`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/http2-wrapper#new-http2agentoptions) or be undefined.  ```diff { -    agent: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}) }  { +    agent: { +        http: new http.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        https: new https.Agent({keepAlive: true}), +        http2: new http2wrapper.Agent() +    } } ```  - The `dnsCache` option is now set to a default instance of [`CacheableLookup`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup). It cannot be a `Map`-like instance anymore. The underlying [`cacheable-lookup`](https://togithub.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup) package has received many improvements, for example, it has received `hosts` file support! Additionally, the `cacheAdapter` option has been renamed to `cache`. Note that it's no longer passed to [Keyv](https://togithub.com/lukechilds/keyv), so you need to pass a Keyv instance it if you want to save the data for later.  ```diff { -    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ -        cacheAdapter: new Map() -    }) }  { +    dnsCache: new CacheableLookup({ +        cache: new Keyv({ +            cacheAdapter: new Map() +        }) +    }) }  // Default:  {     dnsCache: new CacheableLookup() } ```  - Errors thrown in `init` hooks will be converted to instances of `RequestError`. `RequestError`s provide much more useful information, for example, you can access the Got options (through `error.options`), which is very useful when debugging.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     try {         await got('https://sindresorhus.com', {             hooks: {                 init: [                     options => {                         if (!options.context) {                             throw new Error('You need to pass a `context` option');                         }                     }                 ]             }         });     } catch (error) {         console.log(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);         console.log('Here are the options:', error.options);     } })(); ```  - The options passed in an `init` hook may not have a `url` property. To modify the request URL you should use a `beforeRequest` hook instead.  ```diff {     hooks: { -        init: [ +        beforeRequest: [             options => {                 options.url = 'https://sindresorhus.com';             }         ]     } } ```  Note that this example shows a simple use case. In more complicated algorithms, you need to split the `init` hook into another `init` hook and a `beforeRequest` hook.  - The `error.request` property is no longer a `ClientRequest` instance. Instead, it gives a Got stream, which provides a set of useful properties.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     try {         await got('https://sindresorhus.com/notfound');     } catch (error) {         console.log(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);         console.log('Download progress:', error.request.downloadProgress);     } })(); ```  ##### Renamed TypeScript types  Some of the TypeScript types have been renamed to improve the readability:    Old type New type   module module   module module   module module   module module   module module   module module    ##### Other  -   Now requires Node.js 10.19 or later.  #### Enhancements  HTTP2 support is here! Excited? Yay! Unfortunately, it's off by default to make the migration smoother. Many Got users have set up their own Agents and we didn't want to break them. But fear no more, it will come enabled by default in Got 12.  ```js const got = require('got');  (async () => {     const response = await got('https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/anything', {http2: true});     console.log(response.socket.alpnProtocol);     //=> 'h2' })(); ```  1. The `merge` function is slow ([#​1016](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1016)) 2. Use `error.code` instead of `error.message` to compare errors ([#​981](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/981)) 3.

When some errors occur, the `timings` may indicate that the request was successful although it failed. 2. When some errors occur, the `downloadProgress` object may show incorrect data.  #### Bug fixes  1. Requests to UNIX sockets are missing query strings ([#​1036](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1036)) 2. `beforeRequest` hooks aren't called on redirects ([#​994](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/994)) 3.

Got doesn't throw on leading slashes ([#​1057](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1057)) 6. Got throws when passing already frozen options ([#​1050](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1050)) 7. Cannot type Got options properly due to missing types ([#​954](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/954)) 8. `got.mergeOptions(...)` doesn't merge `URLSearchParams` instances ([#​1011](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1011)) 9. The `authorization` header is leaking ([#​1090](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1090)) 10. Pagination should ignore the `resolveBodyOnly` option ([#​1140](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1140)) 11. Cannot reuse user-provided options ([#​1118](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1118)) 12. Broken with Node.js ≥ 13.10.0 ([#​1107](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1107)) 13.

265,ChunkingContext refactor pt. 1 (#4397),"Next.js side: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47693 Description This is part one of a larger ChunkingContext refactor. In this episode, we: 1. Move the runtime and evaluation code off of the entry JS chunk and into a dedicated chunk. This means that, within a chunk group, instead of having one chunk that contains modules + runtime code and chunks that only contain modules, we'll have chunks that only contain modules and one chunk that only contains runtime code. 2. Start a larger enterprise of differentiating between ""intermediate"" chunks (modules), and ""output"" chunks (raw modules). Before, we used modules to represent both intermediate chunks that would never actually be created (optimized away) AND final chunks that would be served or written to disk. Now, modules are only intermediate assets, and modules are the final chunks. 3. Move a few modules from module to module, as their existence (or the implementation) is only meaningful in a dev context (module and module, the latter of which depends on the chunk list for now). Things left to figure out: 1. What does the module trait represent here? We no longer use module, and module is redundant with module. However, it no longer makes sense for modules to be modules as their content is determined by the chunking context. Should we have two traits, one for intermediate chunks and one for output chunks? 2. Should module just be module? We don't need all of the trait methods of either, just an ident and a way to convert to a chunk. The module trait could look like this: module Things that will happen in the next part(s): 1. The module logic will move into module, as it doesn't make sense in a build context. This will essentially make module obsolete: the only thing we need it to do is to compute all parallel chunks, but I'm thinking this should be a method on the module trait instead. Things I'll leave for future refactors: * Figure out the whole Input, Intermediate, and Output asset story. Testing Instructions Snapshots + Next integration tests fix WEB-815 (link)"

301,Implement Streaming Static/Proxy Rendering (#4329),"Description Implements streaming rendering for static/proxy renders (I don't know why they're called static or proxy…) using an initial module message, N module messages, and a final module message. Updating proxy rendering was very easy. It already implemented separate messages for header and body, but it buffered the full body before sending the full contents. But static rendering was a little more difficult, it has multiple paths that are immediately ready with a full body that I didn't want to break apart. So I kept the module message for a full response that transforms into a module, and implemented a new enum type for streaming responses into a module. These is some weirdness with different data types on the module field of a module's module and a module's module. One is a module and the other is a module (and really should be a module), but I'm leaving this for a follow up.

That was not handled correctly before. Now we use a child task to produce the stream that is active as part of the function that returns the stream. We also use a little hack to update the stream in the parent task when the child task is invalidated. It's a bit hacky, but eventually this kind of logic should probably move into turbo_tasks as part of some streaming concept.

346,Bump rustc version. (#4331),The link appear to be related to the module version. Rust is in the process of attempting to land module which was released on March 18 (depending on where you stand in the world). I've bisected the release versions and confirmed that module is the last working release— coincidentally the version from the day we ran the 1.8.5 release. For now I'm hardcoding that into our release process; I have not done any further investigation of the actual root cause which will enable us to update past module. We will need to do that at some point in order to make sure we don't lose the ability to release.
347,fix: make turbo command regex stricter (#4325),"Description With #4223, we started checking and throwing on commands that look like they invoke turbo. The regex is fairly permissive and would match any command that contained a path that ended in module e.g. module would get marked as invoking turbo. This PR restricts the regex so it only matches commands that contain module surrounded by whitespace. This means that we now won't throw if the user directly invokes turbo via a path e.g. module. I think this is the correct tradeoff as it's much more likely a user will invoke turbo via either module or module. Another possibility would be to attempt parse the scripts and do more exact analysis, but to do this and correctly handle Windows would be fun. Testing Instructions See new unit tests"

354,Implement node eval streaming (#4251),"Description This implements streaming Node evaluation using an fun generic module, usable within any Vc (I'm kinda surprised it works). Think of it a bit like a module, it implements both a reader (that can be streaming read with the module trait) and a writer (that can be sent cross threads). As new values are written to the stream, any readers get woken up to receive the next value. Included as part of this is a rework of our ""bytes"" implementations, extracting some logic into a new module crate. Eventually, module should also move out of module into this crate. module are cheaply clonable (they're just a wrapper around module), making them a perfect low-level type to hold the data being sent between processes and threads. They're also easy to convert to and from a real module, so that they can be streamed into our module.

357,feat: port npm lockfile to Rust (#3632),"Adds a Rust port of the npm lockfile implementation only used when module is set. Notes: - The crawling of the lockfile graph is done in the language of the lockfile impl to avoid incurring ffi overhead for every transitive dependency. This change requires moving this function into the lockfile package instead of context in Go (this is probably where it should've belonged all along) - We explicitly make an ffi function in Rust for each lockfile implementation. This adds boilerplate, but as this boundary should be short lived (only around until package graph gets moved into Rust) this is acceptable instead of coming up with a more generic solution. - If we stick with passing the lockfile contents for other implementations then we will be able to share the protobuf message definitions  Co-authored-by: Alexander Lyon link"

This trait has two additional methods: * module -> Creates a ES runtime that only registers chunks' contents * module -> Creates an ES runtime that registers chunks' contents and evaluates its entries This is important because we are going to start having more than one runtime evaluation logic with module (and module and any future bundler-specific work). In the future, this could even be used to have non-Ecmascript runtimes.

372,"If a graph walk task fails, stop the walk.  (#4254)","Description Backstory: I was investigating what needs to be done to support unifying our output to support grouping log output. I encountered an module sitting in run, and while attempting to address that, discovered that we don't fully stop on error even when we mean to. We stop executing scripts but we continue to walk the graph, meaning that we can trigger cache restorations. This PR: - Adds a short-circuiting mechanism to our graph walk so that tasks started after the failed tasks are skipped. Note that tasks started concurrently with the failed task may still run. - Remove the module for the case where we fail to do the setup work to capture task outputs - Adds a test for short-circuiting using a custom visitor to deterministically inject an error into graph traversal Testing Instructions New test in module demonstrates short-circuiting by injecting an error into graph traversal. I opted for a unit test in this case because using a failing script in an integration test will not trigger the broken behavior. We shut down the script-running facility once a script fails. The error needs to occur outside of the user's script to demonstrate the bug, hence a custom graph visitor.  Co-authored-by: Mehul Kar link"

We can't construct a full expected lockfile key from the patch entry anymore as the patch entry doesn't contain information about peer dependencies. To circumvent this we now scan through the entire package list, parse the key, extract the patch hash (if present), and then check if it matches a patch listed in module. Notes for reviewers: - A large portion of this PR is actually porting the lockfile key parsing logic that pnpm itself uses so we can extract the individual pieces that we care about. This logic is in a slightly messy state as the pnpm codebase is currently in a state where it supports v5 and v6 lockfiles. As mentioned in https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/5810 once pnpm@8 lands this code will start to be refactored. I tried to keep the Go port as 1:1 as possible in hopes to make future maintenance easier. - This PR includes new logic for v6 as pnpm now encodes patches in lockfile keys: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/5979 Testing Instructions Added new packages to the pnpm lockfile fixtures that are patched and have peer dependencies. Also verify that the changes work as expected with the provided repro:  - module  - Clone https://github.com/shawnmcknight/turbo-pnpm-patch-repro - Remove private dependency: module  - module - Verify that module contains a module section with both module and module as entries"

420,"Add ""nextpack"" integration setup (#4188)","Hopefully this'll ease our developing in Next.js ``` Nextpack is the development sub-repo, allowing us to develop Next.js features and Turbopack together. This sub-repo will stitch together the rust crates in Next.js and the crates in Turbo, so they appear as 1 logical Cargo workspace. There are two steps: ```bash This will clone next.js into ./next.js if you wanted, you can link your own already-checked-out next.js repo. $ ./scripts/init.cjs This read the Cargo.toml from Next.js and Turbo, generating a new Cargo.toml workspace in this directory. $ cargo run --bin sync-workspace ``` FAQs Failed to load manifest for workspace member … You can't have an optional workspace member (or if you can, I can't figure it out). So the module crate members are gonna error out if you try to run a Turbo crate without first cloning next.js. To fix, run module again. It'll resync your Cargo workspace. Why is module written in JS? See the above. If we wrote it in Rust, any failure in the repo setup would prevent it from running. Why is there a turbo-crates symlink dir? Cargo cannot contain nested workspaces, and if we used module as a workspace member, it would error out. By using a symlink, we avoid the problem. How do I run module with this?

This is the same as the output that we also see in terminal UI in logs. The existing module struct is moved into the module package. The module method now returns a module, which gets updated over the course of the execution, and then attached that to the module. module (now known as module) and other related structs are now private to the module package, and all interactions are through the module struct (namely: module and module)"

455,Merge modules before sending them to the client (#3975),"This diff: * introduces the module trait, which allows for merging the updates of versioned contents within the same chunk group; * implements this for module/module, turning them into module/module; * creates a new module asset which is capable of merging chunk updates of chunks within the same chunk group, and create such an asset for dynamic chunks (through manifest/loader_item.rs) and chunk group files assets. This fixes a bunch of edge cases related to HMR: * HMR of dynamic imports now works; * Chunks getting added/deleted/renamed now also works with HMR, since we're listening to updates at the chunk group level; * CSS chunks get reloaded in the right order, with respect for precedence. There are still known edge cases with HMR: * CSS chunks added through HMR are not inserted at the right position to respect precedence (WEB-652). * Update aggregation is disabled because we don't want a critical issue to stop all HMR (WEB-582) . This would be fixed by applying aggregated updates when dismissing the error modal, but there are some edge cases with this too (e.g. what happens when an HMR update also causes an error on top of an existing error)."

459,update next.js version (#4130),
460,Support exclusions in inputs (#4066),"Description  Support exclusion globs (module) in module specifications Modify file hashing for a package to only consider module in the case where we aren't using module. module already uses module which operates on the state of the working tree, as opposed to module which operates on a particular commit. This additionally fixes an issue where a dirty file not included in module could get included in the hash. Fix manual file hashing to use the correct prefix on globs (and to support exclusions) Modify globby to allow excluding individual files, not just directories  We have behavior to force excludes in globby to apply to directories, but AFAICT we don't document this behavior. Our existing documentation of excludes in module uses module. My preference would be to drop it so that we have a unified globbing syntax. However, my code here special-cases user input that ends in module to maintain both behaviors. Testing Instructions A new integration test uses module with an exclusion to exclude a file from the hash. The excluded file is modified in the test, then hash matching and full turbo are verified. Globby has a new test as well for excluding a single file, vs a directory. module has an additional edge case to handle excluding files in module specifications that fall back to manual file hashing.

Not every file we write is massive, but some of the ones we generate are 100kb+. I hope this can reduce memory pressure a bit by using a consistent 8kb block size, instead of allocating a buffer for the full file contents just to check if we should write.

464,"Introduce TraitRefs, remove cell_local (#3887)","module's semantics are very confusing and can be the cause of particularly hard-to-debug issues. Furthermore, they can't be nested correctly, which is necessary for my future HMR work. Instead, @sokra proposed that we should always use modules instead. This PR introduces a way to generate module-like modules for a given trait Vc. The purpose of these refs is only to be passed around, to be converted back into a module eventually. You can't call any other method on a module. This serves the same purpose as module, as you can ""snapshot"" a value pointed to by a trait Vc through a trait ref, and re-cell that snapshot at a later time (see the tests). However, this has the same pitfall as module: nested modules will still update. @sokra proposed we should have module types which flatten nested modules recursively, but this will have to wait until we have time to tackle tech debt. This also introduces the module method, which works the same way as module but can be used on modules instead."

This was determined to be due to differing allocators. Memory reserved on one side of the sandwich and free'd on the other would sometimes fail depending on toolchains / platform. This resolves that problem. To complicate things, this issue would only arise during cross-compilation, and not when building on the target OS / arch, as the allocator would presumably be the same.

491,Refactor GraphTraversal to avoid non-determinism (#4098),"Description The current design of the module trait makes it easy to introduce non-determinism by having module return different results depending on the order in which it's called. For instance, if module tries to de-duplicate children (as is the case in module): ``` Order 1: 1. (from parent Node1) map_children([NodeA, NodeB]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeA, NodeB]) 2. (from parent Node2) map_children([NodeB, NodeC]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeC]) Order 2: 1. (from parent Node2) map_children([NodeB, NodeC]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeB, NodeC]) 2. (from parent Node1) map_children([NodeA, NodeB]) -> GraphTraversalControlFlow::Continue([NodeA]) ``` These two calling orders will result in different generated graphs, as the first order will forget about the edge Node2 -> NodeB, while the second will forget about the edge Node1 -> NodeB. Instead, this PR makes it so module is called after inserting all nodes into the graph. This ensures that a different ordering can't affect the final shape of the graph. It also refactors the module method and the module trait to make it more consistent with graph terminology and (hopefully) easier to understand. Testing Instructions This solves an issue on the branch sokra/repro-for-alex."
492,Generate a run summary file on turbo run (#4069),
493,Reduce memory usage when writing files (#3526),"This PR reduces the our total memory usage (hopefully) for files that we write to disk. When we write a file, we obviously have the input bytes (the bytes we want to write to disk). But we also read the file to see if the file needs to be written at all. This means we have another copy of the bytes, the ones that came from the disk. Worse, our write is strongly dependent on the read's module. Meaning we're stuck with that read memory until some indeterminate time. And any time we update the written contents, we're gonna get more bytes stuck in our Vc cache. The goal here is to track the file, so that we can rewrite it if it's modified/deleted. Why not have an API specific to tracking, without actually reading any contents? This PR does exactly that. And now that we don't need to read contents to track, we can avoid using the module API (and its module) in order to do our new-old contents comparison."

538,refactor asset identification (#3999)," add Asset::ident() as unique identifier of an Asset add ChunkItem::ident() instead of ChunkItem::to_string() (ValueToString) base module on AssetIdent instead of path only  Motivation: We want to get rid of the module in favor of inner assets. When doing this we no longer need to place virtual assets below the actual file path and they can stay in their original path. But placing virtual assets below the actual asset also made the module unique, which would no longer be the case after using inner assets. Some parts of the code base relied on module being unique (e. g. module ids and chunk paths). But actually we never guaranteed that to be unique. After this PR module is intended to be unique and allow to carry more information than only the path: * Query string (module) * Fragment (module) * Asset (additional wrapped assets by key value pairs) * Modifiers (additional transformations applied on the module, e. g. module, module) * In future: Part (select a subpart of the module, e. g. only export abc, or the module evaluation, or some internal part)"

547,chore: add rust ffi integration tests to CI (#3991),As we write Rust code called by Go via FFI we should run integration tests against it. Once we delete the Go code we can delete the module job in favor of the Rust FFI one Waiting to merge until #3996 to reduce noise on PRs Test plan: Make sure that integration tests run on CI

549,Implement faster Rope equality (#3955),"This optimizes for more reference equality checks. The old code allowed for this to happen for module checks, but it didn't implement reference checks for module shared data. Instead, it'd iterate every module inside the shared rope and perform equality on those."
550,fix: scm make patterns relative (#3996),"Since the Go module used the command line module it appears that the CLI did some light data processing and if we passed the absolute repo root as the pathspec via CLI we wouldn't have issue. It looks like module doesn't do this and expects well formed pathspecs so we shouldn't be passing in absolute paths. This PR will attempt to remove the repo root prefix from module. An alternative would be to change Go's behavior to no longer pass the repo root as the default, but that's a larger change and the Rust and Go implementations of module would still differ in the same way, we'd just avoid hitting this behavior in turbo. Test plan: module now passes as well as the new unit test"
551,feat(codemod): support workspace configs (#3992),"This fixes turbo codemod not building due to the new config schema introduced for workspace configs.  It also adds workspace config support and tests to the codemods that are relevant (env vars and outputs). This isn't strictly necessary as workspace configs were introduced after the version that required these codemods, but I wanted to add this just in case someone uses an old example from around the web to update a workspace config or similar."

554,"Split the ES chunk module into smaller, more focused modules (#3974)","This diff splits the module and module modules into smaller modules, usually centered around one type. The goal of this PR is to make the ecmascript crate easier to navigate and review, as well as reduce the amount of merge conflicts that can arise from modifying imports in two separate diffs within the same module. This PR also changes the visibility of most modules within the crate to be module so they're available to the generated module function, but not accidentally leaked outside of the crate. The same is done on a per-type basis with module or module."
555,Include expanded inputs config for each task in dry run summary (#3957),"This PR adds an module key for each task in the module output and module in module text output with a number of files considered. This only include a count, because the entire list of files could be long."
556,Update Middleware Routing (#3930),"This accomplishes 2 things: - Moves the creation of the edge info onto the Next.js side - Extracts the middleware's module, so that we can know what matchers are needed before invoking the edge function definition. After this, an update to the Next.js side will enable middleware. Fixes WEB-623"
557,fix: make inputs relative to workspace root (#3993),"Inputs are relative to workspace and not repo root so we need to drop the module prefix here. I removed the module input as that directory no longer exists and to correctly capture these inputs we should Turbo-fy our crates instead of listing out all of the directories out here. Also, I'm not sure how we feel about a task depending on a file outside of the workspace. Test plan: module should no longer produce a cache hit on the second run"

573,Remove non-functional css property (#3968),
574,Add per-package-manager instructions to create-new (#3971),
575,Root inference: skip turbo.json (#3946),"Integration tests for inferring the root. This demonstrates that detection based upon module (and the change made in #3938) is not (particularly) relevant to root identification. How to review: - Each commit is pretty self-contained. You can see me adding a debug line to assert against in the first commit. - The third commit is both a revert of #3938 and a full deletion of the module-included detection logic.  OUTDATED There is _one_ behavior change. If you previously: 1. Had nested workspaces (which is not supported by us or any package manager). 2. Had a `turbo.json` at the ""outer"" one. 3. Did _not_ have a `turbo.json` at the ""inner"" one  Then we would have selected the outer one. We now select the inner one, and throw an error because the inner one does not have a `turbo.json`. I believe this to be an _improvement_.   3938 treats any module that has comments in it as nonexistent since module doesn't support JSONC. That everything still worked with parsing that is throwing an error made it clear that the module check was not being used except for the described edge case."
576,Update getting started to depend on turbo.json for order (#3859),"With the improvements to dependOn, it seems to be that this is the new best practice and not having the order defined in the module This would make it easier for new adopters how to structure their turborepo project"
577,Update index.mdx (#3958),
578,feat(turbo-utils): bundle to esm (#3952,"Now that we're throwing a few more things in turbo-utils, we should bundle it to esm instead of cjs to support code splitting. This is an internal package, and everything that consumes this bundles to cjs, so compatibility isn't an issue, and this will ensure each package that uses a util from turbo-utils only gets what it needs instead of the entire package. I tested this locally to see the bundle size difference.  For turbo-ignore, the bundle size drops from module to module. No huge (~6%) but worth it."
579,Fix issue with --filter when only root pkg contains task (#3951),"Always look up task definition, but limit when it's added to the task graph. This allows us to lazy look up task definitions for the purpose of making sure they are defined, even if we aren't going to run them."

605,Support NeedData responses in SourceMap/SourceMapTrace ContentSources (#3907),"This implements a new module trait and module struct that allows our modules to register some processor to transform the eventual module that an inner module returns. Yah, it's a bit of a mouthful with lots of very similar sounding names. Essentially, the old module and module wrapped some inner module, and would request content from them, and process that content into a source map JSON or trace JSON. But, they didn't implement the module response, so it only supported very primitive inner content sources. This PR extracts that knowledge into a single module, which will recursively wrap every module until we land on a fully resolved module. At that point, it hands off the work to a module, which performs the processing on whatever content is returned by the inner module. If you can't tell yet, I'm making the description intentionally verbose to highlight just how similar our struct/trait names are. Fixes WEB-614"
606,Make module parallel (#3836),"This switches the module function from a sequential BFS to a parallel BFS (+ reverse topological sort at the end). I expected this to make some difference in performance, as traversing references in parallel can lead to better CPU usage (see #3771), but in practice our benchmarks show no significant difference. Real apps might be a different story, but I didn't notice any particular performance improvement on vercel.com either. This implementation is not perfect (we're making more calls to module than strictly necessary), but I think it's enough to measure a potential performance improvement. Marking this as a draft for now as it's more complicated than the current implementation and there's no clear win to adopting this."

626,loaders: use pre-compiled loader-runner distributed with Next.js (#3823),"The benefit of this depends on https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45962, but it remains compatible with apps including module. This first attempts to require module from the app's installed version of Next.js, falling back to requiring the package directly. We should probably eventually remove this fallback once all compatible versions of Next.js include the precompiled version, as that has a more predictable version of the package. Test Plan: Linked a local copy of Next.js including https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45962 to an app without module that uses loaders and verified loaders ran."
627,add possible unknown mutation to objects and arrays (#3882),Before the static evaluation didn't consider the fact that objects and arrays can be mutated. So we can't just assume for sure that they have certain properties/items. Instead we add an unknown mutation alternative to handle that. This avoids module to be replaced with module when prop is initialized with true. It might be modified in future.

689,perf: skip visiting if it's out of range (#3762),"Visiting is not necessary for those sub-trees that are already out of range. The first code change For example, we have visitors with module like this, and the current index is module, and the current path is module: ```rust enum Path {   A,   B,   C,   D,   E } visitors: vec![(vec![Path::B, Path::C], visitor), (vec![Path::B, Path::D], visitor)] ``` Given the fact that sub-trees that are not matched were already skipped, so there is no possibility for us to have things like this if we are already under module and looking for the next path (module):  module Combining all the things above, we can skip visits any furthur where its module is greater than the module for the current index, for the first example, the underlying path is module, we can skip the sub-tree module and module as there's no possibility for the visitor subscribers to do with them. The second code change If the starting point for the partition result is already greater than the underlying module, it's not necessary for us to visit them too."

691,Update module for module. (#3789),The in-editor recommendations for module that come from module seem to have fallen behind the API in a few spots. I also took a moment to update some language for improved clarity. I also had to shave a few yaks to work on this: - Updated module task to ensure it generates the module when we run module - Improve deprecation note for environment variables - Added module to module doc

700,fix integration tests on windows (#3737),For windows it's important that the browser is dropped so that the test can complete. To do that we need to cancel the spawned task below (which will drop the browser). For this we are using a JoinSet which cancels all tasks when dropped.
701,Issue Reporters (#3707),"Big thanks to @jridgewell for helping me out with a number of Rust-isms with this change. This expands module and the module to accept an arbitrary module -- a trait implementing module which receives captured issues to send somewhere. This replaces using a fixed module to send issues to stdout/stderr, though module now implements module and is the default implementation of an issue reporter if no other is provided. It also moves the responsibility of detecting fatal errors out of module and into module itself. This lays the foundation for alternative reporters, such as a test reporter to snapshot or assert against issues emitted, or a newline-delimited JSON reporter for other tools to consume.

713,fix: use prerelease update-informer to cut ureq (#3726),module has some good stuff in the pipeline that allows us to specify the http client we use. This is a quick and dirty add support for the updater on Windows ARM. If we don't want to use a non-release version of module than #3722 should be merged instead of this. I expect a new release of module might take a little bit as this is a breaking change due to the updated module trait definition. image

Before, we were parsing URL queries and request headers, only to serialize them some other way afterwards.

The assumption while iterating (for streaming, equality checks, etc) is that the only time we can hit an empty module section is when we reach the end of the entire Rope. If an empty section is hit in the middle of a rope, we can't tell if we've reached the end or we're in the middle without calling N more times (eg, what if an empty section followed an empty section, then we'd need to call 2 more times to see).

Coupled with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/45506, we'll be able to fully automate our release process into Next.js.  The process kicks of with cron every midnight-ish PST. We find the latest commit that passes CI We bump the latest tag version (more on this in a bit) We generate a new GH release with this version  The automated tagging version will break with our current module release process just a bit. The tag action that I'm using can't generate a date-like tag, it can only handle semver (with optional prefix). So I've set it up to generate module tags. The module here differentiates us from Turborepo, and the module tag denotes this a non-release software.

807,Add print_task_invalidation feature (#3537),"I used this to track down the infinite looping behavior #3525 and #3526.

808,Capture engine/run unit tests with prysk (#3592),"This converts unit tests exercising the task graph to integration tests.  The purpose of this change is to make it easier to land lazy loading task definitions, which breaks all these unit tests, due to their use of the AddTask API to setup the test. Additionally, the lazy loading feature will require that these tests have access to the file system to read from config file, which would make them closer to integration tests already. Note that the new tests are here are:  not 1:1 with the old ones, but attempt to capture the scenarios in spirit. asserted with module, because parallel execution makes it a bit more challenging to assert against logs. combined with existing topological-deps tests"

814,Share request resolving logic between http and update servers (#3597),"With the addition of the Next.js routing layer at the root of our content sources, we need the update server to also be able to follow Next.js rewrites, like the HTTP server. This requires the following: * Rewrites need to be able to indicate a source where to ""resume"" after rewriting. Otherwise, we would enter an infinite loop of the Next.js layer rewriting to the Next.js layer. * The resolving logic from module needs to be extracted into its own function, so it may be called both from the HTTP server (which expects fully resolved modules) and the update server (which needs a module): this is where module comes in.

817,fix: bring back tty into ci detection (#3589),3586 changed how we calculate module and dropped the module start to the calculation. This breaks our cmdutil tests as they require the module flag to be true when the test is running. We need module to be true otherwise we won't look at module as a possible token source.
818,fix: pnpm prune misses git dependency (#3517),Fixes #2870 The resolved version of a module dependency is the lockfile key of the package so now when resolving a package we check and see if we can find a package by using just the version instead of module.

844,Wrap CSS chunk items in a @layer (#3542),"In Turbopack, as a consequence of our lazy compilation model, CSS chunks can contain duplicate CSS chunk items. This can cause issues with precedence. Take the following example: Initial CSS chunk: ```css / ... / / chunk item A / h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } / ... / / other chunk item / h1 {   font-size: 4rem; } / ... / ``` Dynamic CSS chunk (loaded after the first page load completes) ```css / ... / / chunk item A / h1 {   font-size: 2rem; } / ... / ``` In this example, when the page first loads, the following rule will be applied: module But as soon as the dynamic CSS chunk loads, the following rule will be applied instead: module However, from the order of rules in the initial load, we know that the former should still apply. We can remedy this particular issue by wrapping each CSS chunk item into its own link (thanks @sokra for the idea!). This ensures that when a CSS chunk item is re-encountered at a later time, it is automatically de-duplicated thanks to the inherent CSS layering algorithm. This is not an issue in Next.js as we can't have duplicated CSS chunk items."

This PR amends stat report action formatting - mainly introducing diff summary between base (module for the PR, module to module for new next.js release). This summary will be piped into slack channel once this PR lands. There maybe some things to amend further, but primary logic seems to working. Please note current base (module) results are incorrectly collected, makes diff summary looks weird. We may need wipe out incorrect data."
848,turbopackLoaders: accept basic loader options (#3540),"Fixes WEB-525 This allows webpack loaders defined by module in module to pass serializable options to loaders. It expands module to accept not just loader names for a given extension, but also module. These options are verified to be serializable and passed to module and exposed as module to the loader. Test Plan: Added an integration test for basic options. Verified the serializable check by passing module as an option value and verified the error was displayed."

852,css modules: use a terser selector format that requires less escaping (#3437),"Fixes WEB-447. Previously, generated classnames would include literal module characters, which need escaping when generating selectors. While users should still escape selectors, this avoids it for this case and makes generated code easier to read. This format is also more aligned with what webpack-based css modules generates. This also removes the square character as a separator, since it breaks words and makes double-clicking for selection more difficult."

862,fix: pnpm prune misses root dependency (#3483),Fixes #2798 which comprised of two issues: - We eagerly checked if a version specifier was already resolved in the package list. This can lead to grabbing a version of the package that doesn't have the expected peer dependencies. This was as easy as moving this check after we have gone down the happy path. - Not copying internal dependencies of the monorepo root. We now internally add module to the prune scope to make sure we get any internal dependencies. For reviewers: I highly recommend reviewing the first commit in this PR initially as it unifies the pnpm lockfile implementations. I realized that my code split was unnecessary and made fixing bugs for lockfile v5 and v6 very difficult.

871,Fix infinite loop caused by error page rendering (#3525),"The new error paths introduced in #3448 both write their outputs to module, which conflicts with: - The main pages source - Each other The infinite loop is very fun: 1. We need a module to render pages 2. To get a module, you need to write your files onto disk     - So a pool is dependent on the contents of those files 3. When we render an error page, we need to write those files to disk 4. The error page shares the same file entrypoint as the main page source So, to render an error, we write the entrypoint, which is shared with main source. This alone is pretty bad, because it will invalidate our page source's node pool (and kill those processes). But, the loop is triggered by a more subtle bug: When we write a file, we read it to see if the contents have changed. Writing creates a dependency on the read! So when the error page is written to disk, it invalidated the read we preformed when we wrote the main page. That invalidated the main page (and it's node pool), and so we rendered again. That wrote the main page's code to disk, invalidating the read of the error page performed when we wrote the error page. ♾️ (I'll be opening more PRs…)"

My hypothesis as it is because of the PNPM node_modules design that is read by VSCode's ESLint extension. But it's because ESLint cannot resolve module. 🚀 How this solution works? This works because module uses the node's module resolution to return the absolute path to a module. It can provide that absolute path to any importing modules."

889,fix: Skip over repo root package for package inferrence (#3503),"Once again map iteration is the culprit. The failure of module is caused by package inference iterating over the root package before the correct candidate package. This results in module and since module is necessarily contained in the repo root, the root package will always be selected as the exact package. The fix is just skipping over the root package. First commit adds a root package to the tests.

Return a rewrite response 3. Stream a middleware response  ~~1. Return a redirect response~~    First, ensure a `x-nextjs-route-result: 1` header is present on the response. Then return a JSON encoded body:  ```typescript {   url: string,   statusCode: u16,   headers: Record   isRedirect: true } ```  The Rust server will then respond with a redirect using to the appropriate location.     Return a rewrite response   First, ensure a module header is present on the response. Then return a JSON encoded body: module The Rust server will use this updated URL to request content from our handlers.   Stream a middleware response   Ensure module header is not present on the response. All headers will be sent back, and the body will be streamed back to the browser.

Internally it holds onto a copy of the config that comes from the file exclusively to avoid accidentally writing a value that was provided via command line or environment variable to the configuration file. module: Handles the loading of the module structure this is where the command line overrides are applied and can be used to mock out the environment to allow for testing without polluting the test proc's environment.

930,fix(release): build turbo-ignore (#3452),
931,refactor content sources to avoid evaluating content before serving (#3334),"fixes WEB-141 This changes the ContentSource API. Before a ContentSource returned a tuple of specificity and content. Now it returns a tuple of specificity and a get_content function. The old way made it very inefficient to combine multiple ContentSource. All combined ContentSources were ask before, all returned specificity and content, and they are ordered after that. That required to compute all contents, even if it is not really used after ordering. Now we order specificity and a get_content function and only compute the content (by calling get_content) with the final result. It also changes how data needs are expressed in the module function. Instead of asking it over and over again with more data, it statically returns the needed data with module and the module function is only called with that data. This is technically more limited than the old way, but one can workaround that if needed. But practically we probably never need that. On the other hand it improves the number of function calls, since the module method is only called once and the module only once per request. Before data needs required at least 2 module calls per request."

We do this since lockfile version can be decided by a combination of module version and module contents. In the future once module is widely used we can switch the ordering of this if it becomes a performance bottle neck - A lot of the implementation was copy/pasta for the slightly different structure. I could have gone the route of making most of these functions work on module, but I don't love doing type assertions all over the place."

However, the logic in the custom action is short & straightforward enough to keep internally. One thing to note is this report uses default automatic github auth token (user module bot).

971,Print resolvedTaskDefinition in DryRun (#3377),"This PR adds a module key to the Dry Run output. Today, this allows users to see the applied defaults for each key in their tasks. In the future, this will allow users to introspect the task config when it's composed from multiple sources."
972,NodeProcessPool: implement debug mode for a single-process passing --inspect-brk (#3385),This implements a debug mode for spawning Node processes across multiple surfaces including module and module. It:  automatically limits concurrency to 1 process per pool passes module to spawned Node process sets the timeout to effectively-infinite duration  Test Plan: set the value to true for the call to module in render_static.rs and attached to a debuggable server renderer process.
973,Dev server: only log requests with status >=400 (#3366),"Fixes WEB-433. This adjusts the devserver to only log requests that have response status >=400. Previously, it logged responses with status between 200-299 (and long requests, if enabled). This change prevents it from logging responses in the 3xx range and the 1xx range. Test Plan: Load a page that uses module, which logs a 302 response without this patch."
974,Fix test fixture for duplicate-names test (#3376),Also updates the name of the fixture
975,fix: update cargo lockfile (#3387),"module on main appears to be link, these are the results of module"
976,Basic @next/font/google integration test (#3170),"This:  Implements a basic http server to mock returning a stylesheet from the Google Fonts API (Note: This importantly does not mock returning the font resources themselves, which are currently loaded by the browser. We should implement something to do this when we implement caching arbitrary http resources traced from module and this is no longer loaded by the test browser) Adds an integration test that asserts the basic shape of the JS object returned by font functions ~Adds an integration test that asserts the browser correctly loads a font for the ascii unicode range, along with the appropriate module, variant, etc.~ Unfortunately module is not reliable with different font-display loading patterns as any of them can fall back.  As noted, this does not mock responses from Google for the font resources themselves, which are currently loaded by the test browser. This means that we'll be dependent on this external service for passing integration tests until we implement caching of modules in Turbopack. We should monitor the reliability of this test."
977,add full next.js config (#3343),
978,Update link hash in blog post (#3384),
979,chore: switch turbo updater to use console for coloring (#3371),"In an attempt to unify our crate usage, this PR switches over module to use module for terminal measurement/coloring and module for tty detection.

983,Install AsyncLocalStorage for appDir rendering (#3374),"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/44668 refactored Next's use of module, and installs a ""polyfill"" of the API by patching the node import onto module Importantly, it's then used in the module scope during imports, so we need to install the polyfill early in the app rendering startup. Fixes https://github.com/vercel/turbo/issues/3319"
984,fix error overlay sometimes now showing (#3331),
985,Factor out ReadTurboConfig method (#3368),"We need this method to be able to read arbitrary turbo.json files, without falling back on package.json config or synthesizing from the package.json. This will be useful when reading configs from workspace directories for composable config."
986,Unused packages. (#3358),"While investigating a Sentry error I discovered that we weren't using a few packages. An error message came in for clipboard copies, and we have no code for that in our (reachable) codebase. Root reason for discovery of these superfluous packages: https://sentry.io/organizations/vercel/issues/3874526717/ (33 fewer packages!)

987,fix(docs): small typo in caching doc (#3365),a tiny update Co-authored-by: Chris Olszewski link
988,chore: Port logout to be pure Rust (#3302),"With this PR module can run without jumping to Go. Notes: - Used module for our config reading. It doesn't support writing configs to disk out of the box, but this can be solved with a wrapper struct. This can probably be abstracted to be generic over different configs, but we should hold off until that seems beneficial. - module is used for coloring output, this is the same crate that module uses for coloring outputs. The module struct is expected to be passed into any subcommands that need pretty output. - A slight behavior change is that we no longer delete the entire config file and instead make the token null (module). If this is unwanted, I can change it back to the old behavior, but I wanted to test out module before someone else tried using it. Co-authored-by: Leah link"

1014,Add basic test for next/dynamic (#3307),This adds two basic tests for next/dynamic: * one ensures that SSR supports dynamic components; * the other ensures that SSR doesn't run when module.
1015,Apply the next/dynamic SWC transform  (#3184),"This PR adds the next/dynamic SWC transform to the repo. This is copied over from the implementation in link, with an additional mode for Turbopack. For now, it applies it to all sources files (excluding node_modules, but including embedded modules). I've refactored the Next transforms logic to make it more easily extendable in the future, and avoid creating more Vcs than absolutely necessary. This PR is the last item in the list of what's needed to support next/dynamic in development."
1016,Implement module map for next.config.js (#3298),Fixes WEB-416. This implements loading an alias map set as module in module. Test Plan: Added an integration test.
1017,Fix deduplication when importing module statically and dynamically (#3297),"The module module was performing deduplication on the module, which is the same between static (module) and dynamic (module) imports of the same specifier. But, the reference to those assets is different, and generates different chunking semantics. In order for both to succeed, we need to process both assets. Coupled with #3193's ability to load chunks on the server side, this fixes fixes WEB-381."
1018,Do not submit a default --output-logs argument from Rust (#3299),"Specifying the CLI arg overrides outputMode from Task Definitions, so we want to ensure that the user explicitly passes it, and not provide a default. Fixes #3272"

1027,module prefixed aliases must not be in fallback aliases (#3291),
1028,Add support for dynamic modules on the server-side (#3193),"This PR separates Turbopack's module into two:  the Browser/DOM implementation, which uses module and module tags for dynamically loading chunks; the Node.js/CommonJS implementation, which uses module instead.  ~~The two runtimes share a lot of code, but I'm not sure what's the best approach for sharing this logic, or even if we should, so for now they are two separate entities.~~ The shared code between the two runtimes is now in a separate file to avoid duplication.

1041,nextest: time out leaky check after 500ms (#3277),"nexttest considers tests leaky if they do not close stdout and stderr within 100ms by default. I've noticed that the tailwind basic test is the only test considered flakey on macOS. Increasing this timeout to 500ms locally makes it no longer marked as leaky. It's still possible the integration tests leak subprocesses on Windows, but this should clear up confusion on other environments. Test Plan: module without it being marked leaky on macOS."

1099,Page data HMR (#3132),"Based on #2968  This builds upon #2968 and @ForsakenHarmony's work on data routes to enable page data HMR. Page data HMR is a bit more clever than it is in Next.js as we won't re-render a Node.js result for each page file update. Instead, thanks to the module transform, there are three versions of the page chunks: * client-side (strips page data exports); * server-side (full); * data server-side (strips page default export). Instead of subscribing to the full server-side result, on hydration, the client-side page separately subscribes to: * client-side updates (already the case); * data server-side updates (new). This means that updating something that only affects the page component will only cause a client-side update and no Node.js re-rendering, while updating something that only affects the data will only cause a server-side update. ~~I'm marking this as a draft for now as there are still a few areas to test/investigate:~~ - [x] When something that is used in both the default page export and data exports is changed, this will cause two HMR updates: one data update, and one client-side chunk update. The same case breaks in Next.js, where we will receive a client-side update, but no server-side update, ending up with an incorrect result. - [x] Differences between module, as well as module (need to talk with @timneutkens about this) (see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/44523) Co-authored-by: kodiakhq[bot] link"

1101,Update examples for stable transpilePackages. (#3167),Co-authored-by: Thomas Knickman link
1102,Refactor the Next SSG transform to handle the inverse operation (#2968),"The original transform The original behavior of the Next SSG transform is to remove module, module, and module from Next.js page files so they can be bundled for the client. This is what enables the following code to work properly without advanced tree shaking: ```jsx import db from ""db""; import PostCounter from  export default function Home(props) {   return <>{props.posts.length} post(s); } const postsPromise = db.getPosts(); export async function getStaticProps() {   return {     props: {       posts: await postsPromise,     },   }; } ``` The transform is able to remove both module and all its exclusive, transitive dependencies, so this is what the client would see: module Adding the inverse operation However, to support proper HMR for these data exports, we need to be able to execute somewhat of an inverse operation: remove the default component export, but preserve all the rest. This allows Turbopack to bundle server-side only declarations, only re-rendering when one of these changes, instead of re-rendering on any server-side and client-side change. From our module above, the updated transform is now also able to generate the following: module As you can see, this module is no longer importing the module, which means re-rendering will not invalidate when that counter changes. However, if the ""db"" module changes, we will still be able to detect a change and re-render. Other notes  I renamed the transform from ""next_ssg"" to ""next_transform_strip_page_exports"". It's much more verbose, but hopefully also much clearer about what it does at a glance. I took the liberty to clean up and comment some parts of the transform to make it more easily understandable (at least for someone like me, who hasn't written a lot of SWC code). I also fixed a few bugs and edge cases. I brought over the tests from the transform in the Next.js and added a couple of them. For now, only the module filter is used. A future PR will build on this and @ForsakenHarmony's https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2949 PR to actually implement SSR/SSG HMR.   Reviewing guide  The crux of the change is the move (and refactor) of the next ssg transform from https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-133d73657647ed793ca4782a73552650b32ad565094b1e0faf452ad58705499b to https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-d6442fa6af9b66e581f062739dd6de2419f5e8f6f3d97cfa63518c72b0a9ee3e. I also added the link and link tests. I adapted fixture.rs to execute on the two transform filters: data exports and default export. Most of the tests in module are copied from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-swc/crates/core/tests. The changes I made are:   i. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-774abee6a1bf139c9ce55e226bf15b52e56ea091170ee5d6295c191fd8d793c7: made this one symmetric for both strip data and strip default transforms.   ii. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-4792266a264dc67da93748d2c6522917f860527a689891bd5f8f4add9841e7f6 wasn't supported before AFAIK.   iii. https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2968/files#diff-a3b12adbce1dec40f39ff8af13ffecbe7f6963e21bc402cef6332ecf5018877e similar to i."

This is exactly the case we're going to hit with redirect/rewrites.

1154,Fix source map tracing for HMR updates (#3063),"HMR is handled via an module, and that eval will inherit the filepath of the currently running file (in our case, the chunk file that contains the runtime code). To properly trace, we need to know both the chunk and the item ids, so we trace via the correct item's source map. Thankfully, we can use the (underspecified) link meta comment to name the file we're currently evaluating. That'll get used as the stack frame's file. We can then encode the chunk path and item id into the filename, and let next's stack tracing code handle the rest. This also fixes an off-by-one on the column. Source maps are 0-based, but the line/column of a file as displayed in an editor or dev tools are 1-based."

1159,Remove chunk item source maps from the asset graph (#3059),"In order to serve source maps with HMR updates, we (used to) reference a source map asset for every chunk item using the items version hash (see #2464 and #2474 for the headaches this can cause). This update changes that, so that a chunk becomes responsible for giving access to one of its item's source map. We already have the module trait which assembles the chunk's module source map from all chunk items, so why not just allow access to an individual section? Coupled with a module that can retrieve the chunk, we can then provide access to that chunk's current item source maps per request."

It also:  Migrates test code to module, and adds module to the module call should it fail again. Mitigates flakiness resulting from browser-side Jest timeouts by moving the circular correctness test to a new directory called module. These tests aren't run at all -- unfortunatley it's not possible to customize Jest's timeout with this particular version of module.

1174,feat(mdx): initial turbopack-mdx asset (#2979),"Implements / fix WEB-86. This PR is an initial attempt to support mdx natively inside of turbopack. It uses mdxrs (https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs) internally to interop - compile - mdx inputs into renderable ecma outputs. PR creates a new type of asset module, and then let its extension (module) can be consumed by turbopack. Since mdx is a variant of ecma asset to be rendered, it requires to perform all of the ecma transforms in the current running turbopack session. But since its AST is not compatible to plain swc (or ecma), it also cannot be passed into existing ecmaassets. MDXAsset does interop for those, by creating a virtualasset for the ecma once mdx is compiled into plain ecma. This might not be feasible appoarch and requires different way to chain asset types, something I'd like to address in this PR. I guess this will be needed for other types of assets in a long run - where input is not an ecma but requires ecma transforms (i.e vue, ng templates)."

1177,fix(turbo): infinite recursion bug (#3019),
1178,fix: use --skip-infer during install (#3023),I think this should fix the install errors with the current canary since the repo inference is having trouble when being run inside of module. This should be valid for all installs going forward as we now support module. Any previous versions that don't support it will use the old install script. Co-authored-by: Thomas Knickman link
1179,fix: invalid json in integration test (#3024),"I committed some invalid JSON in #3011 as the node linter doesn't run on json changes. I'll put up another PR fixing that, but I just wanted to get this out since it's making all PR's that change JS red."
1180,fix: add support for --skip-infer (#3022),"Somehow we didn't support parsing module, the shim parser would allow it, but the actual parser didn't."
1181,publish 1.7.0-canary.0 to registry (#3027),FYI the (turbo) canary has some issues with install. Co-authored-by: Turbobot link
1182,build(next/core): allow to specify tls backend for reqwest (#2994),"Implement / fixes WEB-306. We can't rely on default tls backend for reqwest and hope to work with every target platform we support, due to several constraints. Some target cannot use -sys (openssl-sys), and some can't build rustls due to trasnsitive dep support issue. PR creates explicit opt-in features for those and let upstream application can specify what they need. module currently sets module as default for the general dev workflow conveniences, but that doesn't mean we promote it as default feature set - next-swc, or other like standalone turbopack will configure features by themselves when build binaries for their own."
1183,Add support for new URL (#2944),"Implements module, so that the referenced file acts as a static output file, and transforms the URL into to point to that file in the graph. This is, well, complicated. As you'll see in the comments, we have an ""inert"" asset that acts as a placeholder until the module chunking algorithm gives us access to a module. It's unfortunately not available when we're doing the file parsing, but we can insert a reference to that inert asset. That inert asset will eventually create a module instance, and with that we can finally generate the correct output path for the URL referenced file. We actually discussed whether this could use a module/module (a module can be inserted at parse time), but it turns out that won't give us the necessary control to generate the final module instance. A module always outputs an absolute path as it's default export, and that just won't work when we're trying to reference the file in node SSR. Fixes WEB-142. Pending WEB-279 for full node SSR support. Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers link"
1184,build(cargo): bump up swc_core* (#3012),"Implement / fixes WEB-308 Bumps up all of swc_core* transitive deps, and update test fixtures with latest updates."
1185,fix: expand semver for skip infer flag (#3018),We're currently too restrictive with the semver as module doesn't include canaries of 1.7.0. This relaxes that constraint and adds tests to make sure it's correct now.
1186,style(turbopack): clippy --fix (#3014),Easy clippy improvements via module.
1187,typo: cargo-nexttest -> cargo-nextest (#3008),

1191,feat(shim): extend json args (#3009),
1192,fix(format): fix prettier on main (#3007),
1193,fix: unable to set verbosity via number (#2993),"Previously users were able to set the verbosity via count (module) or by providing a value (module), this PR gives users the ability to do the latter. We achieve this by creating our own module struct that when serialized will be converted to a module allowing us to not change the Go code. I did remove module from the help text as it rendered in a confusing way. Note: This doesn't completely match the old behavior as we allowed for funky stuff like module. (Any guesses what the verbosity level was set to?)"

This leads to when the browser request '/_a8a837.js', turbopack will compile chunks in module ('/_a8a837.js'), module ('/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'), and also chunks in module ('/src_async.js', '/src_async.css'), because of the reference between module and module. But the expected behavior is only compile chunks in module and module, so this PR deleted the reference between module and module, makes the graph be like this: image And makes chunks in module to be compiled only when the browser request '/src_async.js_manifest-chunk.js'."

1265,simplify module (#2899),
1266,Implement import.meta (#2816),"I chose to have the module to have the relative project path on disk. Webpack makes it the absolute system path, but that would make the JS output system dependent and I didn't like that. Vite doesn't bundle and uses the browser's behavior, which is the dev server path. I'm splitting this from the in-progress PR to implement module support. That requires a bunch of changes to the analysis code and a new FS content source, so it's taking longer to ship. Fixes WEB-137."

1269,Support basic next/image loading (#2481),"This implements basic support for serving the images requested by module and module. The big missing features are:  image width resizing (and thus blurry image placeholders) image quality encoding format re-encoding  This required a lot more work than I expected, because we have to also override the module to allow using module with remote images. The only way I found to do this was to override the module env var, which is a special object value injected by webpack's module as if it were an module value.

1288,Make ESLint envVar aware. (#2850),"This optimizes for the typical use case. This means module to find the closest module to the place where module was executed. Currently: - Fail, and have no keys contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (Current behavior.) After this PR, depending on your invocation patterns this will: - Do exactly what you want it to do. (Any time you invoke ESLint because we're finding up to the root of the project we will find the singular correct module.) - Fail, and have no content contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) Once we're in composable module land this will either: - Do exactly what you want it to do. (Your execution directory will find up to the closest module which is the correct composition entry point. Will be the majority of use-cases and matches the Turborepo recommendations.) - Fail, and have no content contributing to the ESLint incremental cache. (You're running from outside the root. Don't do that.) - Fail, and have the wrong values contributing to the key for the incremental cache. (You ran your command from a place where you ""miss"" the correct module when trying to find up. This failure is undetectable.)  This last state needs the most explanation. When this occurs we will be adding a random set of environment variables to the cache key—and not necessarily the ones that matter. This will occur if module does not represent the correct place in the file system to start walking to find module files. When this happens the ESLint incremental cache will be keyed on the wrong thing and won't necessarily invalidate for the correct changes, and will possibly invalidate for unrelated changes. The workaround here would be to modify the module file in question to not use module and look like the following: module We can't notify users of this failure which makes it especially rough."
1289,"Move into TaskState, drop Event (#2799)","move dependencies and event into TaskStateType remove execution_data This will drop the allocation behind Event when a task becomes Done. It also move dependencies from Task to TaskState, which make it more efficient to drop TaskState when GC is able to do that. It also reduces the total size of Task because module and module share memory now."

1384,"Ability to configure ""persistent"" tasks (#2258)","This change allows users to add a module key to their task configuration. This key should be set when the task starts a long-running process that does not exit (such as a dev server or --watch mode for a test runner). When this key is set, turbo will ensure that no other tasks can module this task. Previously, if module depended on a ""persistent"" module, module would never run, because module never exited. This caused a lot of confusion, and our advice was to use the module flag, which meant that all topological ordering was thrown out the window. After this change, turbo will detect this configuration and throw an error. After talking with users, we realized that there isn't really a need to topologically order long-running tasks, so instead of allowing configuration to create this ordering, (and then bypassing it with module), we prevent you from configuring this ordering in the first place! In most cases, that means you can stop using the --parallel flag as well. If we can validate this reasoning, we can will deprecate the --parallel flag over time also."

We can test the turbotrace in the normal module mode and module like mode with the module setting.

Before, we would initialize everything as module, which is not guaranteed to match a zeroed value because of niche optimization[1]. This comes at the cost of slightly higher memory usage, but that should be more than offset by https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2395.

To do:  * [x] This expression covers both module as well as module. Investigate how this usage is impacted and handle it. Test Plan:  * Added a module expression and module member expression in a test app and verified both were flagged (see below) * In the same test app, verified using module was not flagged. ``` path/to/testapp/src/index.jsx:1:12  error TP1106 import.meta is not yet supported        1 > console.log(import.meta);        2   console.log(import.meta.url);        3         4   function Foo() {        5     new.target; path/to/testapp/src/index.jsx:2:12  error TP1106 import.meta is not yet supported        1   console.log(import.meta);        2 > console.log(import.meta.url);        3         4   function Foo() {        5     new.target;        6   } ```"
1544,Don't allocate collectibles unless necessary (#2395),"The module struct is a chonk at 592 bytes. We allocate millions of these, so it adds up very quickly to a massive memory overhead.

This behavior only manifested in a lockfile where a pruned package had a normal dependency descriptor that also appeared as a peer dependency descriptor in a package that wasn't pruned. As background ""descriptor"" is the term Yarn uses for a semver range that appears in a module or lockfile entry. Amended the minimal berry lockfile to now test that we don't keep around descriptors even if they appear in module."

Test Plan: In a new module, opt into appDirectory and create module. Run turbopack and verify: * [x] the index page renders correctly * [x] An issue with Warning level is logged notifying the user an module was created * [x] module is actually created with basic root layout In a new module, opt into appDirectory and create module. Run turbopack and verify: * [x] the index page renders correctly * [x] An issue with Warning level is logged notifying the user an module was created * [x] module is actually created with basic root layout In a new module, opt into appDirectory and create module. Also create a basic module (note js layout with tsx page). Add a custom module to the layout.

1714,Add support for API routes (#163),"This reworks our Node.js rendering logic to allow for: * passing binary request bodies in and out of Node.js: API routes can accept request bodies in POST, and can reply with any content type. * content source results that are recomputed every time: we don't want API routes to be cached (at least not by turbopack for now). It also reworks the module logic to avoid hard coding a single end of operation marker (they're now unique per pool), and allow multiple kinds of operation events (module, module, module). This is not a particularly good implementation for this. A better implementation would proxy the request from the client to the Node.js server in a more direct manner. We also need a way to tell turbo tasks ""don't bother ever caching this"", as right now every single API request and result will still be cached, even if we know they will never be used again. Finally, we should communicate with Node.js processes via a better mechanism than stdout. I made some progress on a prototype for using https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel with NAPI a while back, which I'd like to pick up some time after conf. However, it seems to work well enough for now, so yay. Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers link"

Now, we can! ```rust use turbo_tasks_hash::DeterministicHash; [turbo_tasks::value(shared)] [derive(DeterministicHash)] pub struct Foo {     bar: u32, } // expands into impl turbo_tasks_hash::DeterministicHash for Foo {     fn deterministic_hash(&self, state: &mut H) {         match self {             Foo { bar, .. } => {                 bar.deterministic_hash(state);             }         }     } } ```  This PR refactors our macro generation code to be (moderately) simple to reuse between module implementations. The code was already mostly there, and I chose to use callback modules to allow customizability for each. It generates code similar to: ```rust // The boilerplate is fully customizable fn derived_fn(&self) {     match self {         // For an enum, we expand the variants         VariantA { field, .. } => {...}         VariantB ( field_0 ) => {...}     } } // The boilerplate is fully customizable fn derived_fn(&self) {     match self {         // For an struct, we do a normal destructure         Foo { field, .. } => {...}     } } ``` Co-authored-by: Alex Kirszenberg link Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers link"

1795,Fix chunk path hashing (#94),"This follows https://github.com/vercel/the-three-body/pull/86 to finally (hopefully) fix our snapshot tests. The issue is that there we were directly observing the hash of a module, which is not stable. Every test run can generate new module wrappers, and thus receive different hash outputs. I've chosen to forbid use of module and module trait, and instead require the use of module and a module trait. For values that implement module, you can call module or module. Note that modules must themselves must be moduleable, so that they're usable in, eg, module. This means it possible to indirectly observe the hash of a module, just not directly. We already know that iterating a module is non-deterministic, so as long as you're not iterating, this is fine. This also renames module to module, so that it's usable in other module crates. ```rust use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher; use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher}; fn main() {   let vc = Foo.cell();   let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new(); // This observes the Vc's hash, which is not stable.   vc.hash(&mut hasher); hasher.finish(); } ``` ```rust use turbo_tasks_hash::Xxh3Hash64Hasher; async fn main() {   let vc = Foo.cell();   let mut hasher = Xxh3Hash64Hasher::new(); // It's not (easily) possible to get a Vc's ""bytes"", so you're forced   // to await and get its value.   hasher.write(vc.await?.bar.as_bytes()); hasher.finish(); } ```"

It works by a module trait which can be implemented by anything we want to allow the user to inspect. In future the in browser UI should offer a nice UI to explore your application. In future we probably also want to add some module to the module trait, e. g. to report size of an asset. This UI is very basic currently, but that works for debugging: image"
1840,Throw runtime errors at import time for failed resolution (#14),"Ported from https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/pull/521 Partially addresses https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/issues/249. Resolves https://github.com/vercel/turbo-tooling/issues/527. This inserts code to throw an error at runtime when an unresolvable reference is encountered, at its time of import. This means that code referencing symbols from the import is unreachable. Additionally, I modeled this after what webpack currently does, and the same error-generating expression is generated at each site the symbol is referenced. Other options include:  Continue leaving module in their place, as they are not reachable anyway and this won't impact the running app. Looks clearly wrong, even if it is never run Leave behind the original identifier name (i.e. the given name of the default import or named imports) Don't generate any further code past the import site This feels clean, but I'm guessing it might be surprising to folks grepping in generated bundles not to find their original code there (even if it would never be run with a failing resolution).

In order to surface other potential errors while waiting on CSS modules implementation, I've implemented a Proxy-based shim that will always return a string whenever a CSS module export object is indexed. There are known issues with this implementation:  Only .module.css files should be considered CSS modules and EcmascriptChunkPlaceable; Could have used module  But since this is intended as a temporary workaround, it's probably good enough. An example error this helped surface: we currently don't expose a polyfill for module in Node.js (https://cs.github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/3d499a627f49b911b30120df4e2e39e998d6273b/packages/next/server/node-polyfill-fetch.js?q=fetch#L10)"

The latter is closer to how module works, but it has a couple of issues: * Since module returns a path relative to the workspace, it requires knowing the full path to the workspace. However, this is undefined when the package is compiled from outside of the workspace (e.g. as a dependency of another package). * Procedural macros don't have access to the path of the file where they were originally invoked link, which means that an module macro would not be able to be relative to the invoker file anyway.

This alone doesn't solve my issue with logging. No matter what changes I've tried to the backend (module scopes crawling, collating into a module during reads (because items could be very negative but still have a single positive elsewhere stack)), I constantly see the same message over and over. I now think it's because the module is spawning new root tasks everytime it receives a network request. That root task is completely divorced from prior executions, so every time we've un-emitted, it's just re-emitted during the computation of the new root task's subtasks. I think we need to invert the network-handler -> turbo-tasks nesting to be turbo-tasks -> network-handler, with a persistent root task."
1935,Revamp errors and logging (#467),"This updates all of our Issues to have a consistent display, and changes the way we display source code and debug-level details. In particular, this makes the following changes:  Cleans up the title/description of existing issues We were filling the module field with too much information, because the module field wasn't always shown. Always displays the module This used to be hidden behind the module flag Always displays the code frame of the issue, if it exists This used to be hidden behind the module flag Fixes the module (file path) to display the relative path to the file It was hardcoded to the FS string used by turbotrace Creates a new module function which can provide debug-level information about the internal Rust state This is not shown by default, user must pass module flag  The format for a rendered issue roughly matches: module Where - module is error/warning/etc - module is a self-defined string for the phase of the compiler (eg, ""parsing"", ""running"") - module is a file path to the offending file - module is a short (single-line) title - module is an optional position that generated the issue, which will display a few context lines and highlight the offending span of code - module is a longer (multi-line) message that describes the issue, and what to do about it - module is a (by default not shown) fully detailed, debug-level, message providing insights into the internal state of Rust"

1949,Add support for pages/_document (#456),"This adds preliminary support for pages/_document. The API is more complex than pages/_app, so this required a few more things in order to work. Right now, our module shim does much, much less than the original. We will eventually have to figure out whether we should distribute our own module, or find a way to reuse Next.js' internals. There's a lot of stuff in there so the second option is probably best."
1950,Add support for pages/_app (#442),"This adds preliminary support for pages/_app. There's still some work to do here to support things like module, etc., but that will come in later PRs. I've created issues for these for now. One issue remaining is that renaming module does not switch to the default _app asset. The server needs to be restarted for this to happen. Similarly, adding an _app.js file does not switch from the default asset to it. I'm guessing there's something wrong with the way I set up the import mappings, and they aren't being invalidated properly? fixes #424"

Thankfully, we can include a module comment in the evaled code, so we can get away with deferring creating the source map's content until dev tools is opened.

2132,fix: Support pnpm patches in prune (#1967),"Addresses #1963 This PR fixes two issues with the current implementation of prune for pnpm: module Fixing the first issue required updating the Lockfile interface take a list of workspace dependencies when constructing the subgraph. This is required as workspace dependencies don't appear in packages in the pnpm lockfile format. Taking a quick look at the npm lockfile format, this additional information will be helpful when implementing npm prune so it seems sensible to make this addition. The current implementation of copying dependency patches copies all patches instead of those that are strictly necessary. This was done due to the fact that pnpm duplicates patch info in package.json and in order to only copy the necessary patches we would first need to learn how to prune package.json. This should be done in the future, but is outside of the scope of this fix.   fix pruning of importers   fix copy patches during pruning   force paths to use unix style paths for pnpm workspace packages   address review feedback, fixup path types "
2133,Source Map cleanups and optimizations (#369),avoid temporary string allocations and remove some unused code
2134,Add source map support to ecmascript (#348),"Adds an optional module method to the module trait, which will be used to provide debugging maps. We expect that the source map will be requested from the base asset's path appended with a module, eg module -> module are paired. I've chosen to implement the source maps using a link. This is by far the most efficient way to concatenate the source maps for multiple source files together, because it doesn't require us to modify the source map of an individual section at all. Coupled with the (IMHO) subpar API provided by the module crate, this is essentially the only good choice (we could VLQ encode -> stringify -> parse -> VLQ decode -> adjust -> VLQ encode -> stringify, but that's gotta be slower…). While unusual in the dev ecosystem, it's fully supported by all the browsers and we're targeting a dev server as the initial use case, so it works out well. This also introduces a module, which allows us to concatenate real source files (with source maps) with injected runtime code, preserving the offset positions for the source maps.

The goal of this change is to separate file dependencies from environmental dependencies, so we can continue to improve cache partitioning."
2139,No shallow checkout for linting. (#1972),
2140,Improve CI setup (#1904),"Changes the CI setup to:  Extract Go and node setup to a ""composite"" action, allowing us to  setup all CI jobs consistently. For example, the golangci-lint was building   turbo with Go 1.17, while the Go unit and e2e tests were building with Go 1.18.  Parallelize some jobs for faster feedback  Separates Go unit and e2e tests, and JS lint and tests into separate workflows.   The tradeoff is that each Github Action runner will need to install Go and Node and   build turbo multiple times, but this is fairly fast, and these steps are highly cacheable.  Improve the names of Workflows, Jobs, and Steps to be more debuggable  Some of the naming changes are for consistency, but some make it easier to   scan the list of PR checks and the Action summaries to see what failed and where.   In some cases, the names of Steps are removed, as the command itself is descriptive   enough, that we do not need to name it. Co-authored-by: Nathan Hammond link"

2145,increase benchmark timeouts to be able to benchmark larger module counts (#362),
2146,Add basic .devcontainer.json and Dockerfile (#359),"This checks in a basic .devcontainer.json and Dockerfile, allowing VSCode [0], GitHub codespaces [1] (not tested), and a general-purpose cli [2] (also not tested) to provision an environment for building and testing turbopack in an automated way. This allowed me to quickly test under Linux, and might be helpful to folks testing Linux while developing on Windows (cc @sokra). It also includes Chromium, allowing us to test things like benchmarks which use headless Chromium. Turborepo also uses devcontainers, though I'm not sure how extensively in development. [3] This uses Debian ~Testing~Stable (""bullseye""). I wanted to use the latest Ubuntu LTS to match what we use in GitHub actions, but unfortunately Chromium is only distributed there as a snap package, and using only apt simplified the Dockerfile. Test Plan: * Set up remote development in containers in VSCode [4]  * Chose ""Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"" and selected turbo-tooling * Ran module inside the container and confirmed success [0] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers [1] https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/introduction-to-dev-containers [2] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli [3] https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/232643c3d1890261c51072180389cd6cd05a534c/.devcontainer [4] https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial"

2151,switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing (#1893),Start using the go-yarnlock package for parsing and encoding yarn lockfiles. We're doing this as this implementation is mostly a copy of the JS based yarn lockfile marshalling code. The code this is replacing was a mix sloppy mix of regex and post-processing. For testing I added some unit tests around parsing/encoding and ran turbo prune on the repo produced by npm create-turbo and running yarn dev on the resulting pruned project. Commits squashed: * switch over to use go-yarnlock for yarn.lock parsing   run go mod tidy to fixup deps   handle windows style newlines   fix lint and simplify entry splitting   address typos   more robust handling of crlf

Since this was not mentioned explicitly anywhere, it took me way too long to figure out my mistake. This change to the docs might help others not make the same mistake in the future.

However, what if your API is only returning a subset of the data (such as the mutated part), that can be populated into the cache? Usually, an extra revalidation after that mutation is needed. But now you can also use a function as `populateCache` to transform the mutate result into the full data:  ```js await mutate(addTodo(newTodo), {   optimisticData: [...data, newTodo],   rollbackOnError: true,   populateCache: (addedTodo, currentData) => {     // `addedTodo` is what the API returns. It's not     // returning a list of all current todos but only     // the new added one.     // In this case, we can transform the mutate result     // together with current data, into the new data     // that can be updated.     return [...currentData, addedTodo];   },   // Since the API already gives us the updated information,   // we don't need to revalidate here.   revalidate: false, }); ```  The new definition:  ```ts populateCache?: boolean | ((mutationResult: any, currentData: Data) => Data) ```  Here is a demo for it: https://codesandbox.io/s/swr-basic-forked-hi9svh  ##### Bug Fixes  #### What's Changed  -   refactor: revalidateIfStale has an effect on updates, not only mounting by [@​koba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1837](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1837) -   fix: reset stale unmountedRef in suspense by [@​promer94](https://togithub.com/promer94) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1843](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1843) -   test: add a test for the behavior of revalidateOnMount when the key has been changed by [@​koba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1847](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1847) -   feat: Support `populateCache` as a function by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1818](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1818)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2  ### [`v1.2.1`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.2.1)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)  #### Highlights of This Release  ##### `shouldRetryOnError` accepts a function  Previously [`shouldRetryOnError`](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/error-handling#error-retry) is either true or false. Now it accepts a function that conditionally determines if SWR should retry. Here's a simple example:  ```js const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => {   // Fetcher throws if the response code is not 2xx.   if (!res.ok) throw res   return res.json() })  useSWR(key, fetcher, {   shouldRetryOnError: (error) => {     // We skip retrying if the API is returning 404:     if (error.status === 404) return false     return true   } }) ```  Thanks to [@​sairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) for contributing!  #### What's Changed  -   `shouldRetryOnError` accepts a function that can be used to conditionally stop retrying   by [@​sairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816) -   build(deps-dev): bump next from 12.0.8 to 12.0.9 by [@​dependabot](https://togithub.com/dependabot) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1821](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1821) -   fix: useSWRInfinite revalidates with revalidateOnMount by [@​koba04](https://togithub.com/koba04) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1830](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1830)  #### New Contributors  -   [@​sairajchouhan](https://togithub.com/sairajchouhan) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1816)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1  ### [`v1.2.0`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.2.0)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.1.2...1.2.0)  #### Highlights of This Release  ##### Optimistic Updates with Auto Error Rollback  There are now some new options in `mutate`:  ```js mutate(patchUser(user), {   optimisticData: user,   populateCache: true,   rollbackOnError: true,   revalidate: true, }) ```  Here the cache will be immediately updated to `user`, the “optimistic value”. And then a request (remote mutation) is started via `patchUser(user)` and the response will be written to the cache. If that request fails, the original result will be rolled back safely so the optimistic value will be gone. And after all those finish, a revalidation will start to fetch the latest value.  This is extremely helpful for building the optimistic UI pattern.  You can do the same for the global `mutate`, just remember to pass the key. Also, the current `mutate` APIs stay unchanged so `mutate(data, false)` works the same.

This doesn’t break environments that don’t support `.mjs`. An alternative `.esm.js` and CJS bundle are also published.

Previously it uses the initial snapshotted fetcher.  ##### Avoid Unnecessary Auto Revalidations  When refocusing on the window with state changes (like clicking a button that changes the SWR key immediately), SWR now avoids revalidations if they're not necessary. Details can be found in [#​1720](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/issues/1720).  ##### New Types for `useSWRInfinite`  Two types for `useSWRInfinite` are added: `SWRInfinteHook` and `SWRInfinteKeyLoader`. You can use them to type the hook and the `getKey` function.  ##### New `populateCache` option for `mutate`  A new option to control if the mutation data should be written to the cache. You can find the details in [#​1729](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/issues/1729).  #### What's Changed  -   Make polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame` more robust by [@​thomaspaulmann](https://togithub.com/thomaspaulmann) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1707](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1707) -   type(infinite): export SWRInfinteHook and SWRInfiniteKeyLoader from infinite, rename InfiniteFetcher to SWRInfiniteFetcher by [@​houkanshan](https://togithub.com/houkanshan) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1714](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1714) -   feat: Ensure auto revalidations are executed after state updates by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1720](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1720) -   Add moduleNameMapper to jest by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1724](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1724) -   Improve test by [@​promer94](https://togithub.com/promer94) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1725](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1725) -   feat: Use the latest reference of fetcher by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1727](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1727) -   fix: Re-export InfiniteFetcher by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1728](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1728) -   feat: Add `populateCache` option to `mutate` by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1729](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1729) -   Fix local state sharing example deps by [@​huozhi](https://togithub.com/huozhi) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1737](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1737) -   Merge states for concurrent requests by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1741](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1741) -   Skip error retrying when document is not active and improve tests by [@​shuding](https://togithub.com/shuding) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1742](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1742)  #### New Contributors  -   [@​thomaspaulmann](https://togithub.com/thomaspaulmann) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1707](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1707) -   [@​houkanshan](https://togithub.com/houkanshan) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1714](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1714)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.1.1...1.1.2  ### [`v1.1.1`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.1.1)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1)  #### Highlights of This Release  ##### Dynamic `refreshInterval`  You can now pass a function as `refreshInterval`, to dynamically return the interval (in millisecond) til the next request, based on the current data:  ```typescript useSWR('key', fetcher, {   refreshInterval: function (data: Data | undefined) {     if (!data) return 3000 // Initial request      return data.next_update   } }) ```  If return `0`, polling will be stopped.  #### What's Changed  -   feat: refreshInterval as a function by [@​Andrewnt219](https://togithub.com/Andrewnt219) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1690](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1690) -   test: add refreshInterval function returns 0 by [@​Andrewnt219](https://togithub.com/Andrewnt219) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1691](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1691) -   fix: If `newData` is deeply to the latest state, broadcast the latest state by [@​icyJoseph](https://togithub.com/icyJoseph) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1697](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1697) -   fix: Return `undefined` data if key's falsy under suspense mode by [@​icyJoseph](https://togithub.com/icyJoseph) in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1698](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1698)  #### New Contributors  -   [@​Andrewnt219](https://togithub.com/Andrewnt219) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1690](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1690) -   [@​icyJoseph](https://togithub.com/icyJoseph) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1697](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/pull/1697)  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1  ### [`v1.1.0`](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/1.1.0)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/vercel/swr/compare/1.0.1...1.1.0)  #### Highlights for This Release  ##### 1.

2257,chore(deps): update dependency esbuild to ^0.15.0 (#1848),"link This PR contains the following updates: | Package | Change | Age | Adoption | Passing | Confidence | |---|---|---|---|---|---| | link | link | link | link | link | link |  Release Notes  evanw/esbuild  ### [`v0.15.7`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#​0157)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.15.6...v0.15.7)  -   Add `--watch=forever` to allow esbuild to never terminate ([#​1511](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1511), [#​1885](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1885))      Currently using esbuild's watch mode via `--watch` from the CLI will stop watching if stdin is closed. The rationale is that stdin is automatically closed by the OS when the parent process exits, so stopping watch mode when stdin is closed ensures that esbuild's watch mode doesn't keep running forever after the parent process has been closed. For example, it would be bad if you wrote a shell script that did `esbuild --watch &` to run esbuild's watch mode in the background, and every time you run the script it creates a new `esbuild` process that runs forever.      However, there are cases when it makes sense for esbuild's watch mode to never exit. One such case is within a short-lived VM where the lifetime of all processes inside the VM is expected to be the lifetime of the VM. Previously you could easily do this by piping the output of a long-lived command into esbuild's stdin such as `sleep 999999999 | esbuild --watch &`. However, this possibility often doesn't occur to people, and it also doesn't work on Windows. People also sometimes attempt to keep esbuild open by piping an infinite stream of data to esbuild such as with `esbuild --watch /` where `` is an integer must be treated as if they were `n` times the `..` operator instead (the `` path segment is ignored). So `/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js` maps to the underlying file `/path/to/project/../../foo.js`. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.          However, old versions of Yarn used to use `$$virtual` instead of `__virtual__`. This was changed because `$$virtual` was error-prone due to the use of the `$` character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes `$$virtual` an alias for `__virtual__`, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.      -   Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories          The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.      These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.  ### [`v0.15.0`](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#​0150)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/v0.14.54...v0.15.0)  **This release contains backwards-incompatible changes.** Since esbuild is before version 1.0.0, these changes have been released as a new minor version to reflect this (as [recommended by npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/)). You should either be pinning the exact version of `esbuild` in your `package.json` file or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as `~0.14.0`. See the documentation about [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/) for more information.  -   Implement the Yarn Plug'n'Play module resolution algorithm ([#​154](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/154), [#​237](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/237), [#​1263](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1263), [#​2451](https://togithub.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2451))      [Node](https://nodejs.org/) comes with a package manager called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which installs packages into a `node_modules` folder. Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within `node_modules`, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). While Yarn can install packages using `node_modules`, it also offers a different package installation strategy called [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp/), which is often shortened to ""PnP"" (not to be confused with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is an entirely different unrelated package manager).      Plug'n'Play installs packages as `.zip` files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read `./some.zip/lib/file.js` actually automatically extracts `lib/file.js` from `./some.zip` at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system.      Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the [`@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@​yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp) plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a `.zip` file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside `.zip` files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API).      With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a `.pnp.js`, `.pnp.cjs`, or `.pnp.data.json` file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need `@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp` anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as `module` and `browser` in `package.json` files within `.zip` files should now be respected.      Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find `--log-level=verbose` helpful.

2293,Use parking_lot in tt-memory (#288),"While profiling module using module, I noticed that locking/unlocking the module in module was responsible for a significant chunk of the overall execution time. My first reaction was to try to minimize the lifetime of the module in module to avoid contention. However, it's unclear whether it's lock contention that's causing the slowdown, or if it's just the locking/unlocking mechanism of module itself. Instead, I switched to module, and instantly noticed great improvements. Benchmark: 30k sierpinski triangles Before: module Total execution time 71s image After: module Total execution time 18s image module is still a very hot path, and three things stand out: * Allocating a module for children; * module; * The module in module:  image Replacing it with module yields even greater improvements: module Total execution time 14s (5x speedup!) image Looking at the traces, it looks like there's more low-hanging fruits for further optimizing turbo-tasks and turbopack. This was tested on macOS 12.5.1, Apple M1 Max, 32GB. Traces: link"
2294,Move module to module (#1779),This PR does a few things: 1. Moves module to module. 2. (temporarily) Duplicates some utils and constants from module into module to prevent cycles. These will be removed in a followup commit. 3. (in a separate commit) module => module. (excluding the turbopath folder) The goal here is to make what are sweeping changes to the codebase still feel as incremental as possible. The next increment is module to module by combining the files and fixing the expectations of method calls throughout the codebase.
2295,(refactor) add lockfile abstraction (#1789),"This PR introduces a new lockfile abstraction that will allow us to easily add more lockfile support to other package managers. It also  Notable changes:  - module now stores the lockfile interface instead of a yarn specific lockfile  - module now only stores the package names as they appear in the lockfile, these will be mapped to their entries when the pruned lockfile is created  - The initial implementation would cache the processed version of the yarn lockfile and attempt to use it. I did some light testing and I don't think this has a significant perf hit since the processing is straightforward. From my understanding of Golang I think having module as an interface makes sense since each package manager has a different data layout for their lockfile e.g. pnpm has 6 top level entries and yarn's top level entries are the package entries themselves. Testing: The e2e tests cover yarn prune, but I also tested that prune produces the an identical lockfile before and after these changes on a repo created with module."
2296,"Remove --no-gc flag, always run with garbage collection (#1803)","This PR:  * Removes the module flag  * Makes using the GC the default. A parsing bug meant no one was using module, so use this opportunity to enable GC. Benchmarks show negligible difference in execution time."

2305,fix: use docker cache best practices in examples (#1673),"The whole purpose of the module is to use docker caching best practices while the Docker examples do not follow these bests practices.    Plus, I believe that the first stage of the Dockerfile is wrong as it copies the whole project and defeats the entire purpose of the caching because the first layer never gets cached. I believe the most optimized solution is to run the module before the module on the machine that runs the module and set the module directory as the docker build context.   I understand that showing this approach may not be possible in the example, so I suggest we add a comment to the first stage with the above explanation."

2308,Benchmarks: Install node_modules and reuse test directories (#284),"This:  Runs module in test directories to provide turbopack with modules necessary to bundle them. Reuses test directories for iterations across the given benchmark. This prevents unnecessary file writing and module for each iteration, improving the times to run benchmarks.

2320,HMR support + React Refresh (#252),"This PR implements HMR support with React Refresh built-in. For now, in order for React Refresh to be enabled, you'll need the module package to be resolveable: module in your app folder.  Depends on #266  Integrated both HMR-and-React-Refresh-specific logic directly into the ES chunks' runtime. Webpack has more complex setup here, but for now this makes the logic much more easy to follow since everything is in one place. I have yet to implement the ""dependencies"" signature for module/module, since React Refresh does not depend on them. We'll have to see if they're even used in the wild or if we should deprecate them. Only implemented the link, not the link. We apply all updates as soon as we receive them. Added support for ""runtime entries"" to ES chunks. These are assets that will be executed before the main entry of an ES chunk. They'll be useful for polyfills in the future, but for now they're here to evaluate the react refresh runtime before any module is instantiated.  Next steps for HMR: * Implement CSS HMR * Implement (or decide to deprecate) the link of module/module * Clean up module some more: switch to TypeScript, split into multiple files, etc. It'd be nice if all of this could be done at compile time, but how to achieve this is unclear at the moment. Can we run turbopack to compile turbopack?"

2322,Split dynamic import loading (#261),"This splits dynamic loading into two phases, ""skinny"" and ""fat"" chunks. The skinny loader chunk is shipped in the same chunk that uses dynamic module expression. Its responsibility is to load the fat loader chunk from the server. The dynamic import has been rewritten to load this skinny chunk item, which will load the fat chunk from the server, which will load all the chunks needed by the dynamic import. Finally, we'll be able to load the module we're trying to dynamically import. Splitting the dynamic import into a quickly generatable skinny chunk item and a slow to generate fat chunk item allows for faster incremental compilation. The traversal won't be performed until the dynamic import is actually reached, instead of eagerly as part of the chunk that the dynamic import appears in."

2361,fix(cli): fallback to manual hashing for global (#1747),
2362,Implement snapshot tests (#241),"This implements snapshot testing, which writes all chunks to the filesystem. Hopefully these'll be a little quicker to test than the evaluation tests, which require us to spin up a browser to execute. The snapshots will detect if a file is expected (in the output dir) but it's not output by turbopack, if a file is output but was not expected, or if the contents has changed. It also supports a module env, which will pass all tests, update all files to the latest outputs, and delete any files that shouldn't exist. The test structure follows a module directory structure. Eg, module The module is the output chunks we expect turbopack to generate. A few things are still left todo: - Diffing of the files isn't supported, which would be very helpful for finding changes. - I didn't handle static assets, and CSS could be broken. - It only supports module as the entry point, but we should support many entrypoints (and different filenames and extensions) via an module. - We only perform Browser transformations, but we should support any via an module. - I don't know if a nested directory structure is possible for output chunks, so it only supports module files."
2363,Move parent_path into FileSystemPathVc (#265),"This moves module (which takes a module) to be directly on module. There's already a module method which internally calls module with self, which seems to be an indirect way to implement this. With the new method location, we're able to take advantage of module to skip some unnecessary work. And we also reduce duplication, there were two nearly identical implementations of module between module and module."

No path with backslash should enter the FileSystemPath APIs, they should be normalized during conversion from module to module Co-authored-by: Tobias Koppers link"

There may also be an issue where tests are using the same directory to write node_modules and when running in parallel are erroring out.

2405,fix consistency issues (#224),There are a bunch or problems with invalidations:  The fs impl watches path case-insenstive. This means two paths might conflict when on a case-sensitive filesystem. It uses an array of Invalidators now Move the next-dev bootstrapping logic out of the run_once scope (which is not updated when invalidations occur). Instead it's executed inside the request handling resp. update stream where changes can be handled. module was not an Value type actually. This fixes that. Adds a new module wrapper to pass transient by reference. module was broken when using nested TaskScopes. This fixes that.

Notable things:   Installs yarn and disables corepack as part of the test suite. This     is the pristine state we want for the tests that exist today. For     future tests cases that have a different setup, we may need to     modify this more.   Disables Windows tests. This yarn setup on Windows does not seem to     work, but this gets us one step forward. "
2410,add basic next pages support (#223),Server Rendering:  This adds an additional ContentSource to next-dev which takes care of handling the module directory. The content source creates a ServerRenderedAsset from each file in the module or module directory and a AssetGraphContentSource for that. The ServerRenderedAsset will reference an underlying asset for the node.js context which will be passed to the node executable for rendering. It uses a WrapperAsset to add additional communication logic.  Client Transition:  When annotating modules with module the NextClientTransition is used This transition changes the environment to browser It wraps the referenced asset with a next-hyrdation wrapper asset It leaves a little module in the previous context which exports a list of URLs for chunks needed. The NextClientTransition takes a client_chunking_context as argument which specifies how the client code is chunked.
2411,output to terminal when we are just waiting for cache uploads (#1686),"As a stopgap before we move cache uploads to the daemon, I added some terminal output if uploading is blocking process completion.  While obviously not ideal that users are just waiting for cache population, I think it's at least better that they know that that is what is happening, rather than the process appearing to hang."

Since we were only upgrading corepack in order to avoid link which only happens the first time a user sets up a package manager on a machine, I think this an acceptable regression in order to unblock development.

Add module which returns a module. modules have a built-in versioning mechanism as they must implement module. module is a trait, so module can contain a specific version implementation by asset type. This is particularly important because...  A module can be diffed with a module from the same underlying module type with module. This returns an module which describes the steps necessary to update from one verson to the next. In the case of ES chunks, this will be a map of added, and modified module IDs, with their respective factories, and a set of deleted module IDs. Implement diffing for ES chunks."

This is powered by the test-generator crate, which allows us not to have to manually enumerate each case. We could consider using this for the node-file-trace tests as well. * Starts the dev server on a free port and opens a headless browser to its root. The browser control is implemented with the https://crates.io/crates/chromiumoxide crate, which expects Chrome or Chromium to already be available. Eventually it will: * [x] Implement a minimal test environment loaded in the browser so that assertions can be run there from bundled code. * [x] Report back the results of these assertions to rust, where we can pass/fail cargo tests with those results. In the future it could: * Possibly include snapshot-style tests to assert on transformed results. This could be in the form of fixture directories instead of files cc @jridgewell * Support expressing special configuration of turbopack in a fixture, possibly as another file in the fixture directory. * [x] ~Possibly support distributing tests to a pool of open browsers instead of opening and closing for each test.~ Test Plan: See next PRs"

2455,Attempt at an alternative corepack implementation. (#1656),"I don't actually know if this will work, but I was trying to make the system itself responsible for maintaining the executable paths so that we didn't need to account for it in our e2e scripts."
2456,Weird makefile differences (#1653),When run via module and directly on the command line this was getting different results.
2457,Make the defensive behavior correct. (#1651),"Defensive behavior caught a build issue, but not where I expected it."
2458,fix(berry arg parsing) (#1612),  remove debug action from CI   add e2e test for arg parsing   add fix for berry arg passing   Create more robust arg passing testing script   The initial testing script had a hidden dependency on the length of the node path which would trigger the output to be spread over multiple lines. This lead to confusing logic around handling the case when it all fit onto one line. This commit changes the script to now always output all information on a single line.   add additional test cases for arg passing   add pnpm6 to e2e tests   move pnpm 6/7 behavior split into new package manager   Add comments and delete unused code 
2459,docs: fix turbo prune with docker blog example (#1596),This updates the turbo prune with docker multi-stage builds example from the 0.4.0 release blog post so that it can be run without errors. See the Github comments for further explanation.
2460,fix: remove debug action from CI (#1649),An action I was using to debug CI jobs in #1632 accidentally got merged
2461,switch e2e tests to use corepack (#1632),"A quick and dirty switch to use corepack for managing package managers for our e2e tests. A few things to note:  - Running these tests on a local machine will enable corepack on that machine, this could be undesired for some devs.  - I found that it is necessary to forcibly add the corepack install dir to the top of $PATH in case a dev has a package manager installed elsewhere that would take priority. At the moment this is only useful for the Yarn/Berry split, but it would simplify #1612 which adds pnpm6 to e2e tests quite a bit."

It will bubble up the call graph until processed via: module The module variant will return the emitted values, but they will continue to bubble up the call graph. The module variant will stop bubbling and parent tasks will not see these values. You may re-emit them via module again. Peeking is a bit more efficient. Emitting is pretty cheap.

2499,Custom debug implementation for Vcs (#193),"This PR builds our own module-like derive-macro machinery for formatting structs, relying on module for the actual formatting. Usage A new module trait is automatically implemented for all modules, which has a single module method which resolves to a debug representation that can then be printed to the screen. module also implement the module method directly. module If you have a module struct with a field that doesn't implement module, you'll want to declare that field as module. For instance: ```rust [turbo_tasks::value(ContentSource, serialization: none, eq: manual, cell: new, into: new)] pub struct TurboTasksSource {     #[debug_ignore]     #[trace_ignore]     pub turbo_tasks: Arc>, } ``` Why not use module directly? We can't use module because our values are resolved asynchronously and can nest modules arbitrarily. I tried using module to resolve them synchronously in a module implementation but that causes deadlocks."

2525,fix: modern yarn lockfile parsing error (#1597),"Description The header string written to the pruned lockfile by the module command starts each of the metadata fields at the beginning of a line. This causes the module, module, and module fields to be parsed as separate fields, when really the module and module should be nested within module.  This silently causes the yarn cache to miss on every dependency without throwing an error. Fixing this line drastically improves dependency install times for pruned workspaces when the cache exists. Additionally, turbo throws an error link when running a module install afterwards due to the un-nested metadata: module Solution Because the link sets the indent to two, adding two spaces before each of the fields should make this valid syntax.

This moves browser opening from the turbopack-dev-server crate into the next-dev crate, which has the cli entrypoint that runs the dev server. It looks like the dev server package is meant to be used as a library (it's only a library crate), and having this external side effect feels unexpected and makes it difficult to use this crate in situations like a test runner for next-dev, where we should test with a headless web browser. Alternatively, opening the browser could be an option passed when creating the dev server, but this feels a bit cleaner to me.

2865,Label root package in dependency graph (#1491),"Fixes #1333  Previously, our package dependency graph used whatever name the root module had. This PR changes it to always use our internal root-package token (module). This lets us reference the root package later in the process and properly work out dependency- / dependent-relationships that include the root package. Unfortunately, we don't yet have the infrastructure for unit testing this part of the code. We'll likely need to break apart module a bit more before it's really tractable. Verified experimentally using the repo in the linked issue."

Instead, read it on demand in module and module  * Behavioral change: running module in a directory w/o a module will no longer immediately error, so we can display usage / help information. module is, however, still required as of this change. Notes on future work: module requires module because module requires it. But module only needs it to construct the global hash value, which isn't needed for constructing the package-dependency graph. If migrate module to its own top-level function, I think module won't need module at all."

2941,fix(cli): cache with correct file perms (#1429),"Fixes https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/156 Issue Summary There were two main issues causing this:   We're using generic filesystem function for the cache operations. These functions require a file mode for the source file, and a file mode for the destination file. We were setting the incorrect bit here causing all files to be restored from cache with one file mode.    When recursively walking files, the walk function we use seems to be link mode (it's always 0)   The Fix To fix this, I've made the file copying functions a bit less generalized (they no longer require a source mode, or a destination mode). Instead, they always use the mode of the source file for the destination file. I also pushed the logic of sourcing the source files mode into the Copy function, below where the incorrect mode was being returned from module. This makes these functions slightly less reusable, but for our purposes, this is what we need. We can always add back generalized versions in the future."

Added ""outputLog"" Tests   Added ""outputLogs"" Documentation   Simplified TaskOutputMode Constants   Changed TaskOutputMode Into Enum   This commit replaces the TaskOutputMode strings with an appropriate enum and related parsing. It now uses UnmarshalJSON to parse as well and so we can remove module entirely.

3060,Log to temp files then rename (#1351),"Log files are hard-linked into the cache, so when re-running a task we need to ensure we don't pollute a previous run.  This changes our logging to stream to a temp file, which we then rename to the actual log file. This serves to break the hard link.  Note that:  * renames will succeed even if the target already exists, as long as the target isn't a directory. All of our targets are log files  * renames can fail if the rename is across filesystem boundaries. Our renames are within the same directory. Fixes #1323"

One of the consequences of the side effects is that sometimes, when simply wanting to check for existence, we would error out entirely because the path wasn't writable. This splits the process of creating and reading a config file path, which means that the error won't be encountered unless a user is explicitly trying to create a configuration file. (Which should be an error.) Fixes #1270"

For example: ```    TURBOREPO Welcome to Turborepo! Let's get you set up with a new codebase.    ? Where would you like to create your turborepo? ../../my-cool-repo ``` Will create a new turborepo at module, and the module module will be: module; This is similar to how module and module work."

3101,Port run to cobra (#1298),Removes some long-deprecated flags:  - module  - module  - module
3102,Create noopCache to ensure that users always have a valid cache object. (#1317),"This makes it possible for a repository whose CI configuration is module to work when receiving pull-requests from forked repositories that do not have access to secrets configuration in CI. Example failures: - https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/pull/1302: link - https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/7575: link One example workaround: https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/7873 However, since this does not prevent the build from running to completion, I do not believe that it should be a hard error. While in the process of addressing this I also discovered that, since the module can remove itself, there is an alternative path to triggering a panic if the module is the only cache you have enabled and it removes itself. Using a module as a cache of last resort (similar to the link) resolves both of these issues. Related to: #1169"

This caused us to copy their pointed-to contents as if the symlink was a directory, and then when copying the link itself, throw an error because it already existed (as a directory...).

3149,Implement root tasks (#1040),"Adds the ability to run tasks from the root module file. Implementation notes that will need to be documented:  * Tasks run from the root are opt-in. That is, modulemust have an entry for module to enable running that task at the root.  * module is available in filters, so module will run module.   * If an entry exists in module for module, then module will also run that task for the root.  * There is some best-effort cycle detection in place. If the root module has module, then even after opting in, module will produce an error. This cycle detection can be circumvented with aliases or other indirection used to run module.  * For the purposes of changed files, any changed file in a repo that doesn't belong to another package is considered to belong to the root.    * Note that this could cause frequent runs of root tasks if they are triggered from git changes. With module specified, they should hit cache if nothing relevant has changed. Additional changes:  * module tests now include a root task  * a package task is now sufficient to mark a particular task as runnable by module. e.g. if you defined module but not module in module, previously running module would be an error, now it will run module.

3367,Proposal for incremental path refactor (#995),"This PR is a proposal for how we can start to get a handle on the various kinds of paths that module uses. My goal is the following:  * Eventually ensure that an absolute, platform-dependent path is used any time we interact with the filesystem    * This will allow us to guarantee that we don't break module, which is likely currently broken  * Eventually ensure that we can easily identify relative paths, both with respect to the monorepo root and to a particular package root  * Be incrementally adoptable. There is a huge amount of surface area to this change, so it's important to be able to tackle it a piece at a time  * Be auditable. The goal would be to eventually ban usage of module and a subset of module functions anywhere in the codebase outside module. It may even be possible to automate this in CI. Furthermore, entry points and exit points from our custom types (currently just module) are clearly marked, along with the intention of eventually migrating them, if appropriate (e.g. module, module).  * New PRs that interact with the filesystem should use module, even if they need to use one of the migration functions to facilitate that. Hopefully this will force both the submitter and reviewer to focus on ensuring that the new code will work properly with module. I've done a few pieces of the migration to show what it would look like in the code base in a partially migrated state. module contains the module type, which ideally would be the sole way to interact with the filesystem. Please let me know what you think about the api and the migration overall."

The classic example is module. If module depends on module, and module changes, that should no longer force a cache miss for module, so long as the module task has no dependencies.

3426,chore(ci): enable color in github actions for CI,
3427,feat(colors): add options for forcing color/no-color,"This change checks for --color / --no-color as command-line arguments as a mechanism for forcing color in non-TTY situations, or forcing --no-color for TTY. Additionally, this change hooks into the FORCED_COLOR environment variable that is used by the link that is used by a variety of packages in the node ecosystem. The intention of this PR is to alleviate some of the concerns from Issue #897 by allowing users of turborepo to enable color output on CI runners such as Github Actions which support color output (as mentioned in the link). With github actions and local builds are both running in color, then the cached output should be consistently in color, compared to the current situation where its a mix of color and non-color output with a remote shared between CI and users building interactively. The FORCED_COLOR environment variable is something that I find myself already setting when running turbo so that the streamed output is in color for the build and testing tools that I am running with it, so it seemed like a natural way to provide this argument without needing to modify the CLI parameters being passed to turbo. In the event multiple methods are being used, the precedence is: * isTTY or not (provided by fatih/color) * $NO_COLOR (if set, then color is disabled) * $FORCED_COLOR (""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""true"" will enable color, ""0"", or ""false"" will disable color) * --color/--no-color (the last argument wins if both exist)"

It should no longer be necessary.  * Remove the test for module and module implying module  * Add a new scheduler test that mimics the way module now behaves.  * Add a debugging profile for doing a dry run against the kitchen sink example. Future work includes being able to write a test in module to get the whole end-to-end graph build, but we don't quite have the infrastructure for that yet (also required for follow-on work to #911)  Note that this is technically a breaking change. Previously, if module depends on module, and the module task depends on module the following would be true:  * module would test module but not build module  * module would build module and test module AND module. With this change, module will now build module and test module. The addition of tasks running for unselected packages is new. While this seems like more work being done, in practice I expect users to be able to move from the second example above to the first, ultimately resulting in less work being done: module will no longer need to run to get module to run."

In particular, these paths are coming from globby and don't pass through the normalization from the linked PR, so they are still os-dependent. I have encountered some problems with builds failing in GH Actions because dependencies that should have been built already were not found when I had previously built those projects on my windows machine. I believe this PR should fix the problem but I haven't had the chance to try reproducing the existing issue to verify that this fixes it.

As an example, say module depends on module, module depends on module. If module depends on module, and a#buildmodule^build`.  Currently, running module will do module, module, module, and module. But, we don't need module. We just need module, since that's what module depends on, and module doesn't really know anything about module directly, just via module. So, we instead just draw an edge to direct dependencies, and then let them sort out their own dependencies. For a large example, here are before and after graphs for running module in module: Before: image After: image Also get rid of an unused field, module, on module."

To enable this, we store artifacts in the cache relative to the root of the monorepo (see screenshot) below for before (top) and after (bottom). image Since we are changing how cache is structured, I updated the global cache key in turbo in order to prevent prior old artifacts from ever ever being cache hits with after this change The only downside to this change, which might not be a downside at all, I guess, is possibility that artifacts are now tied to the directory structure of outputs relative to the root of the monorepo."

More specifically this removes the general check for yarn pnp and moves it into the prune command instead as this is the part that likely has remaining issues with pnp since nothing else that I'm aware of needs to know about module. This PR builds off of #795, as otherwise you can't even run turbo to be able to hit the previous nodeLinker checks. Let me know if you would like me to change things around so that it is more explicitly enabling for the run task as opposed to enabling for all but prune."
3660,Extract ResolvePackages (#830)," Move package resolution logic to module package Remove unused functionality from module interface to make it easier to mock in tests Start adding tests for scope resolution  Review Note: module provides examples of parsed flags and how they translate to packages considered in-scope. I've done my best to infer what packages should be built in each scenario, but please verify. Also very happy to accept additions to that test. Possibly controversial change: To maintain backwards compatibility, specifying module and module to module will imply module. This means that using scope will generally cause all dependencies of the specified scopes to be built, although the cache will still be used so this may potentially be cheap.  Previously, this behavior was triggered when module and module constraints produced packages to be built. In cases where they were both specified but one or both did not produce packages to be built, dependencies were not included.  With this change, the behavior will be consistent based on commandline flags and default to building dependencies. With an upcoming switch over to module for commandline parsing, we should be able to flag off building dependencies if the user requests it."

3667,fix(peer-deps): don't consider peer deps when constructing graph (#813),"Splitting this out of #802. I tried this first when attempting to fix my own build issues in that PR after discovering Issue #407 which suggested peerDependencies might be the problem. It wasn't enough to solve the build hangs with my project, but seems to have its own merits. If a package has a peer dependency but there is no corresponding devDependency, then it should be presumed that there are no build-time dependency on that package. For example, if there was code that would be executed by one of the scripts that tried to import from the peer package, this would generally speaking fail to run, because node would be unable to resolve the dependency unless another package was pulling it in and it got hoisted, etc. Workspace dependencies are kind of a special case in that they won't be hoisted and can be resolved by node, but if you were to ever move that package out of the monorepo then that same situation as above would fail to build. As a result, my impression is that for any use-case where peerDependencies need to be explicitly part of the dependency graph is actually just a missing dependency declaration bug where that package should actually be part of the dev deps. I have also changed the order in which dependencies, optionalDependencies, and devDependencies are selected to match the order that lerna uses for cases where the package shows up in multiple places. See: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/a47fc294393a3e9507a8207a5a2f07648a524722/core/package-graph/index.js#L53-L58 The attached issues mentions making a flag to control this behavior, but given the reasoning above, I'm not sure if there is ever a situation where you would want to have a peer-dependency impact the dependency graph if its not also a regular or dev (or optional) dependency. Fixes: #407"

When turbo currently tries to build the dependency graph, it doesn't consider the specified version/range of the dependency, it just assumes that if that package name exists in the workspace it must be an internal dependency. Because of this, cycles are detected and the process hangs. This PR adds some additional logic to ensure that dependencies are only considered internal if the local/workspace package's version matches the semver range specified for the dependency. Fixes: #796"

Try it out in your IDE by adding module image It also updated all (that i saw :P) documentation examples to include the module property, this way, it will go by default for all module users out there. But i still need to point out some things:  As the module (Is that even a good name?) script is going to be ran a lot, may we add module to the module group? In the root module file, i saw an module property, but it is not documented, should i add it or it just shouldn't be there?
