Async http protocol loop.   Change of test: don't require early bad request error but only after CRLF-CRLF.   Add back streaming requests.   Rewritten request body parser.   Misc. cleanup, down to 4 failing tests.   All tests OK.   Entirely remove request body queue.   Let black f*ckup the layout   Better testing error messages on protocol errors.   Remove StreamBuffer tests because the type is about to be removed.   Remove tests using the deprecated get_headers function that can no longer be supported. Chunked mode is now autodetected, so do not put content-length header if chunked mode is preferred.   Major refactoring of HTTP protocol handling (new module http.py added), all requests made streaming. A few compatibility issues and a lot of cleanup to be done remain, 16 tests failing.   Terminate check_timeouts once connection_task finishes.   Code cleanup, 14 tests failing.   Much cleanup, 12 failing...   Even more cleanup and error checking, 8 failing tests.   Remove keep-alive header from responses. First of all, it should say timeout= which wasn't the case with existing implementation, and secondly none of the other web servers I tried include this header.   Everything but CustomServer OK.   Linter   Disable custom protocol test   Remove unnecessary variables, optimise performance.   A test was missing that body_init/body_push/body_finish are never called. Rewritten using receive_body and case switching to make it fail if bypassed.   Minor fixes.   Remove unused code.   Py 3.8 check for deprecated loop argument.   Fix a middleware cancellation handling test with py38.   Linter 'n fixes   Typing   Stricter handling of request header size   More specific error messages on Payload Too Large.   Init http.response = None   Messages further tuned.   Always try to consume request body, plus minor cleanup.   Add a missing check in case of close_if_idle on a dead connection.   Avoid error messages on PayloadTooLarge.   Add test for new API.   json takes str, not bytes   Default to no maximum request size for streaming handlers.   Fix chunked mode crash.   Header values should be strictly ASCII but both UTF-8 and Latin-1 exist. Use UTF-8B to cope with all.   Refactoring and cleanup.   Unify response header processing of ASGI and asyncio modes.   Avoid special handling of StreamingHTTPResponse.   35 % speedup in HTTP/1.1 response formatting (not so much overall effect).   Duplicate set-cookie headers were being produced.   Cleanup processed_headers some more.   Linting   Import ordering   Response middleware ran by async request.respond().   Need to check if transport is closing to avoid getting stuck in sending loops after peer has disconnected.   Middleware and error handling refactoring.   Linter   Fix tracking of HTTP stage when writing to transport fails.   Add clarifying comment   Add a check for request body functions and a test for NotImplementedError.   Linter and typing   These must be tuples + hack mypy warnings away.   New streaming test and minor fixes.   Constant receive buffer size.   256 KiB send and receive buffers.

644,Forwarded headers and otherwise improved proxy handling (#1638),"  Added support for HTTP Forwarded header and combined parsing of other proxy headers.   Accessible via request.forwarded that tries parse_forwarded and then parse_xforwarded  parse_forwarded uses the Forwarded header, if config.FORWARDED_SECRET is provided and a matching header field is found parse_xforwarded uses X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-* much alike the existing implementation  This commit does not change existing request properties that still use the old code and won't make use of Forwarded headers.   Use req.forwarded in req properties server_name, server_port, scheme and remote_addr.   X-Scheme handling moved to parse_xforwarded.   Cleanup and fix req.server_port; no longer reports socket port if any forwards headers are used.   Update docstrings to incidate that forwarded header is used first.   Remove testing function.   Fix tests and linting.   One test removed due to change of semantics - no socket port will be used if any forwarded headers are in effect.   Other tests augmented with X-Forwarded-For, to allow the header being tested take effect (shouldn't affect old implementation).   Try to workaround buggy tools complaining about incorrect ordering of imports.   Cleanup forwarded processing, add comments. secret is now also returned.   Added tests, fixed quoted string handling, cleanup.   Further tests for full coverage.   Try'n make linter happy.   Add support for multiple Forwarded headers. Unify parse_forwarded parameters with parse_xforwarded.   Implement multiple headers support for X-Forwarded-For.   Previously only the first header was used, so this BUGFIX may affect functionality.   Bugfix for request.server_name: strip port and other parts.   request.server_name docs claim that it returns the hostname only (no port).  config.SERVER_NAME may be full URL, so strip scheme, port and path HTTP Host and consequently forwarded Host may include port number, so   strip that also for forwarded hosts (previously only done for HTTP Host).  Possible performance benefit of limiting to one split.   Fallback to app.url_for and let it handle SERVER_NAME if defined (until a proper solution is implemented).   Revise previous commit. Only fallback for full URL SERVER_NAMEs; allows host to be defined and proxied information still being used.   Heil lintnazi.   Modify testcase not to use underscores in URLs. Use hyphens which the spec allows for.   Forwarded and Host header parsing improved.   request.forwarded lowercases hosts, separates host:port into their own fields and lowercases addresses  forwarded.parse_host helper function added and used for parsing all host-style headers (IPv6 cannot be simply split("":"")).  more tests fixed not to use underscores in hosts as those are no longer accepted and lead to the field being rejected   Fixed typo in docstring.

1074,Pausable response streams (#1179)," This commit adds handlers for the asyncio/uvloop protocol callbacks for pause_writing and resume_writing. These are needed for the correct functioning of built-in tcp flow-control provided by uvloop and asyncio. This is somewhat of a breaking change, because the write function in user streaming callbacks now must be awaited. This is necessary because it is possible now that the http protocol may be paused, and any calls to write may need to wait on an async event to be called to become unpaused.  Updated examples and tests to reflect this change. This change does not apply to websocket connections. A change to websocket connections may be required to match this change.   Fix a couple of PEP8 errors caused by previous rebase.   update docs   add await syntax to response.write in response-streaming docs.  remove commented out code from a test file",Pausable response streams (#1179),"This commit adds handlers for the asyncio/uvloop protocol callbacks for pause_writing and resume_writing.
