Use Python 3.7+ way of specifying TLSv1.2 as the minimum version. Linter fixes. isort Cleanup, store server name for later use. Add RSA ciphers. Log rejected SNIs. Cleanup, linter. Alter the order of initial log messages and handling. In particular, enable debug mode early so that debug messages during init can be shown. Store server name (SNI) to conn_info. Update test with new error message. Refactor for readability. Cleanup Replace old expired test cert with new ones and a script for regenerating them as needed. Refactor TLS tests to a separate file. Add cryptography to dev deps for rebuilding TLS certs. Minor adjustment to messages. Tests added for new TLS code. Find the correct log row before testing for message. The order was different on CI. More log message order fixup. The tests do not account for the logo being printed first. Another attempt at log message indexing fixup. Major TLS refactoring. CertSelector now allows dicts and SSLContext within its list. Server names are stored even when no list is used. SSLContext.sanic now contains a dict with any setting passed and information extracted from cert. That information is available on request.conn_info.cert. Type annotations added. More tests incl. a handler for faking hostname in tests. Remove a problematic logger test that apparently was not adding any coverage or value to anything. Revert accidental commit of uvloop disable. Typing fixes / refactoring. Additional test for cert selection. Certs recreated without DNS:localhost on sanic.example cert. Add tests for single certificate path shorthand and SNI information. Move TLS dict processing to CertSimple, make the names field optional and use names from the cert if absent. Sanic CLI options --tls and --tls-strict-host to use the new features. SSL argument typing updated Use ValueError for internal message passing to avoid CertificateError's odd message formatting. Linter Test CLI TLS options. Maybe the right codeclimate option now... Improved TLS argument help, removed support for combining --cert/--key with --tls. Removed support for strict checking without any certs, black forced fscked up formatting.

Fix long line lengths of debug messages Add some new debug messages when websocket IO is paused and unpaused for flow control Fix websocket example to use app.static() remove unused import in websocket example app re-run isort after Flake8 fixes Some fixes to the new Websockets impl Will throw WebsocketClosed exception instead of ServerException now when attempting to read or write to closed websocket, this makes it easier to catch The various ws.recv() methods now have the ability to raise CancelledError into your websocket handler Fix a niche close-socket negotiation bug Fix bug where http protocol thought the websocket never sent any response. Allow data to still send in some cases after websocket enters CLOSING state.

437,Fixed default path in documentation,0.5693603,1731 Support mounting application elsewhere than at root path,"Streaming request by async for. Make all requests streaming and preload body for non-streaming handlers. Cleanup of code and avoid mixing streaming responses. Async http protocol loop. Change of test: don't require early bad request error but only after CRLF-CRLF. Add back streaming requests. Rewritten request body parser. Misc. cleanup, down to 4 failing tests. All tests OK. Entirely remove request body queue. Let black f*ckup the layout Better testing error messages on protocol errors. Remove StreamBuffer tests because the type is about to be removed. Remove tests using the deprecated get_headers function that can no longer be supported. Chunked mode is now autodetected, so do not put content-length header if chunked mode is preferred. Major refactoring of HTTP protocol handling (new module http.py added), all requests made streaming. A few compatibility issues and a lot of cleanup to be done remain, 16 tests failing. Terminate check_timeouts once connection_task finishes. Code cleanup, 14 tests failing. Much cleanup, 12 failing... Even more cleanup and error checking, 8 failing tests. Remove keep-alive header from responses. First of all, it should say timeout= which wasn't the case with existing implementation, and secondly none of the other web servers I tried include this header. Everything but CustomServer OK. Linter Disable custom protocol test Remove unnecessary variables, optimise performance. A test was missing that body_init/body_push/body_finish are never called. Rewritten using receive_body and case switching to make it fail if bypassed. Minor fixes. Remove unused code. Py 3.8 check for deprecated loop argument. Fix a middleware cancellation handling test with py38. Linter 'n fixes Typing Stricter handling of request header size More specific error messages on Payload Too Large. Init http.response = None Messages further tuned. Always try to consume request body, plus minor cleanup. Add a missing check in case of close_if_idle on a dead connection. Avoid error messages on PayloadTooLarge. Add test for new API. json takes str, not bytes Default to no maximum request size for streaming handlers. Fix chunked mode crash. Header values should be strictly ASCII but both UTF-8 and Latin-1 exist. Use UTF-8B to cope with all. Refactoring and cleanup. Unify response header processing of ASGI and asyncio modes. Avoid special handling of StreamingHTTPResponse. 35 % speedup in HTTP/1.1 response formatting (not so much overall effect). Duplicate set-cookie headers were being produced. Cleanup processed_headers some more. Linting Import ordering Response middleware ran by async request.respond(). Need to check if transport is closing to avoid getting stuck in sending loops after peer has disconnected. Middleware and error handling refactoring. Linter Fix tracking of HTTP stage when writing to transport fails. Add clarifying comment Add a check for request body functions and a test for NotImplementedError. Linter and typing These must be tuples + hack mypy warnings away. New streaming test and minor fixes. Constant receive buffer size. 256 KiB send and receive buffers. Revert ""256 KiB send and receive buffers."" This reverts commit abc1e3edb21a5e6925fa4c856657559608a8d65b. app.handle_exception already sends the response. Improved handling of errors during request. An odd hack to avoid an httpx limitation that causes test failures. Limit request header size to 8 KiB at most. Remove unnecessary use of format string. Cleanup tests Remove artifact Fix type checking Mark test for skipping Cleanup some edge cases Add ignore_body flag to safe methods Add unit tests for timeout logic Add unit tests for timeout logic Fix Mock usage in timeout test Change logging test to only logger in handler Windows py3.8 logging issue with current testing client Add test_header_size_exceeded Resolve merge conflicts Add request middleware to hard exception handling Add request middleware to hard exception handling Request middleware on exception handlers Linting Cleanup deprecations Co-authored-by: L.

In particular, request.server_name and request.server_port are currently unreliable. Fix Windows compatibility by not referring to socket.AF_UNIX unless needed. Compatibility fix. Fix test of existing unix socket. Cleaner unix socket removal. Remove unix socket on exit also with workers=1. More pedantic UNIX socket implementation. Refactor app to take unix= argument instead of unix:-prefixed host. Goin' fast @ unix-socket fixed. Linter Proxy properties cleanup. Slight changes of semantics. SERVER_NAME now overrides everything. Have server fill in connection info instead of request asking the socket. Would be a good idea to remove request.transport entirely but I didn't dare to touch it yet. Linter 💣🌟✊💀 Fix typing issues. request.server_name returns empty string if host header is missing. Fix tests Tests were failing, fix connection info. Linter nazi says you need that empty line. Rename a to addr, leave client empty for unix sockets. Add --unix support when sanic is run as module. Remove remove_route, deprecated in 19.6. Improved unix socket binding. More robust creating and unlinking of sockets. Show proper and not temporary name in conn_info. Add comprehensive tests for unix socket mode. Hide some imports inside functions to avoid Windows failure. Mention unix socket mode in deployment docs. Fix merge commit.

Accessible via request.forwarded that tries parse_forwarded and then parse_xforwarded parse_forwarded uses the Forwarded header, if config.FORWARDED_SECRET is provided and a matching header field is found parse_xforwarded uses X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-* much alike the existing implementation This commit does not change existing request properties that still use the old code and won't make use of Forwarded headers. Use req.forwarded in req properties server_name, server_port, scheme and remote_addr. X-Scheme handling moved to parse_xforwarded. Cleanup and fix req.server_port; no longer reports socket port if any forwards headers are used. Update docstrings to incidate that forwarded header is used first. Remove testing function. Fix tests and linting. One test removed due to change of semantics - no socket port will be used if any forwarded headers are in effect. Other tests augmented with X-Forwarded-For, to allow the header being tested take effect (shouldn't affect old implementation). Try to workaround buggy tools complaining about incorrect ordering of imports. Cleanup forwarded processing, add comments. secret is now also returned. Added tests, fixed quoted string handling, cleanup. Further tests for full coverage. Try'n make linter happy. Add support for multiple Forwarded headers. Unify parse_forwarded parameters with parse_xforwarded. Implement multiple headers support for X-Forwarded-For. Previously only the first header was used, so this BUGFIX may affect functionality. Bugfix for request.server_name: strip port and other parts. request.server_name docs claim that it returns the hostname only (no port). config.SERVER_NAME may be full URL, so strip scheme, port and path HTTP Host and consequently forwarded Host may include port number, so   strip that also for forwarded hosts (previously only done for HTTP Host). Possible performance benefit of limiting to one split. Fallback to app.url_for and let it handle SERVER_NAME if defined (until a proper solution is implemented). Revise previous commit. Only fallback for full URL SERVER_NAMEs; allows host to be defined and proxied information still being used. Heil lintnazi. Modify testcase not to use underscores in URLs. Use hyphens which the spec allows for. Forwarded and Host header parsing improved. request.forwarded lowercases hosts, separates host:port into their own fields and lowercases addresses forwarded.parse_host helper function added and used for parsing all host-style headers (IPv6 cannot be simply split("":"")). more tests fixed not to use underscores in hosts as those are no longer accepted and lead to the field being rejected Fixed typo in docstring. Added IPv6 address tests for Host header. Fix regex. Further tests and stricter forwarded handling. Fix merge commit Linter Linter Linter Add  to avoid re-using the  variable. Make a few raw strings non-raw. Remove unnecessary or Updated docs (work in progress). Enable REAL_IP_HEADER parsing irregardless of PROXIES_COUNT setting. Also cleanup and added comments New defaults for PROXIES_COUNT and REAL_IP_HEADER, updated tests. Remove support for PROXIES_COUNT=-1. Linter errors. This is getting ridiculous: cannot fit an URL on one line, linter requires   splitting the string literal! Add support for by=_proxySecret, updated docs, updated tests. Forwarded headers' semantics tuning. Forwarded host is now preserved in original format request.host now returns a forwarded host if available, else the Host header Forwarded options are preserved in original order, and later keys override earlier ones Forwarded path is automatically URL-unquoted Forwarded 'by' and 'for' are omitted if their value is unknown Tests modified accordingly Cleanup and improved documentation Add ASGI test.

The new implementation is much faster than either cgi.parse_header or equivalent werkzeug.parse_options_header, and unlike the two, handles also quoted values with semicolons or \"" in them. Fix string escape. Useless linter complaints. More linter issues Add return type hint. Do not support quoted-pair escapes. Improved documentation and renamed the function more aptly as it only seems   to apply to content-type and content-disposition headers. Unquote filenames also in normal mode. Add tests for headers. Adapted from CPython parse_header tests with changes on the final test. Linter Revert ""Unquote filenames also in normal mode."" This reverts commit bf0d502bcd5c443a4178f1c239692976c0f5f185. Improved parse_content_header and added tests with Firefox and Chrome. Unescaping of quotes moved to parse_content_header because it affects all fields,   not just filenames. It is impossible to handle all cases correctly but the current heuristics should   suffice well for typical cases and beyond. Added comparisons with cgi.parse_header and werkzeug.parse_options_header. Updated comments as well.",0

950,No tracebacks on normal errors and prettier error pages (#1768),0.54229534,2667 Nicer traceback formatting (HTML page),"The current implementation of sanic attempts to make use of ujson if it's available in the system and if not, it will default to the inbuilt json module provided by python. The current implementation of ujson does not provide a mechanism to provide a custom seperators parameter as part of the dumps method invocation and the default behavior of the module is to strip all the spaces around seperators such as : and ,. This leads to an inconsistency in the response length when the response is generated using the ujson and in built json module provided by python. To maintain the consistency, this commit overrides the default behavior of the dumps method provided by the json module to add a seperators argument that will strip the white spaces around these character like the default behavior of ujson This addresses the issue referenced in #1398 Signed-off-by: Harsha Narayana harsha2k4@gmail.com",0

These are needed for the correct functioning of built-in tcp flow-control provided by uvloop and asyncio. This is somewhat of a breaking change, because the write function in user streaming callbacks now must be awaited. This is necessary because it is possible now that the http protocol may be paused, and any calls to write may need to wait on an async event to be called to become unpaused. Updated examples and tests to reflect this change. This change does not apply to websocket connections. A change to websocket connections may be required to match this change. Fix a couple of PEP8 errors caused by previous rebase. update docs add await syntax to response.write in response-streaming docs. remove commented out code from a test file",0

For wrong parameters, errors will be generated from: listeners += args By checking just list type, the raised error will be associated with [args] instead of args, which is not given by users. With this patch, the raised error will be associated with args. Then users can notice their argument was neither callable nor list in the easier way. Function -> Functions in document Regarding the parameter as a list is harmless to the user code. But unawareness of its type can be list can limit the potent of the user code.",0
