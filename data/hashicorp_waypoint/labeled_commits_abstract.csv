internal: Cleanup remote URL trimming for git,0.8582658,internal: Improve git URL string trimming when determining remote URLs [GH-4675],"Prior to this commit, it was possible to craft a bad git remote and bypass our normalize func for remote git URLs. TrimLeft and TrimRight remote all occurances of the given pattern. The intention however is to only remove the first instance of git@ and the last instance of .git from the given url.

cli/runner_install: Do not use cli slice for runner platform,0.79182935,cli: Avoid panic in empty slice for runner installs platform var. [GH-4672],"Prior to this commit, the runner install cli attempted to use the target var for the EnumVar platform. We make this an EnumVar because the flag package gives good validation when you pass a string that isn't one of the supported values. In practice however, the CLI only uses a single value, the first one in the slice. To avoid any panics, we simply use a string var once the flag package has parsed and actualized its values.

"Fix bug caused by trying to fix bug related to job ""loss""",0.40116578,when trying to cancel a running job. [GH-4294],"TLDR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. The source of all of this is ultimate a 3 year old bug: link That code used = instead of :=, which caused the goroutine to update the 'primary' job local variable used by everything else in the function. So WHEN (not if, as we'll see in a moment) ctx is canceled, job becomes nil, and any code further down in the function will see than nil DEPENDING on the goroutine scheduling order. So, why would the context be canceled? The goroutine defined right after this does defer cancel() when the client disconnects. So due to the magic of goroutine scheduling, it's possible for the server.Recv() goroutine to exit, canceling the context, then the WatchSet goroutine wakes up, because there is a job change (as we just updated it), causing the loop to start and JobById uses a canceled context. We attempted to figure out WHY the job was nil in the past by adding code into the primary select statement at the bottom of the function, which introduced a second pathology: the WatchSet routine pushed a value onto errCh when it used the canceled context, and the 'job is nil' detection code did a non-blocking read on 'errCh' AFTER it read an event (almostly certainly a Complete event btw). We then saw the error and figured ""oh something is weird and wrong"", so we logged and basically orphaned the Complete event because we had no job record to record things with! TLDidR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. I've renamed various other job-related variables that held jobs from 'job' to something else to prevent a similar condition in the future.",0

bolt: Fix pre-v0.10.4 config sources.,0.6201405,upgrade: Fixes a bug where pre-v0.10.4 config sources could not be updated or,"This commit updates the Bolt DB implementation of config sources to ""upgrade"" a pre-v0.10.4 database record from the config_source table. Prior to v0.10.4, the unique identifier for each record in the table was the name of the plugin. This was changed in v0.10.4 with the addition of scoped config sources, and now the ID is a hashed value, whose hash structure is defined by the plugin name, scope, and workspace name. This commit therefore deletes any ""old"" records, those whose ID is the name of any known config sourcer plugin, from Bolt DB, and creates new records with the ID correctly hashed. With this fix, users who had config sources prior to v0.10.3 may continue to interact with those config sources, whereas before this commit, they could not, and the config sources were permanently ""stuck"" in the database as they were before upgrading.",0

The variable system is requesting it's dynamic default vars as ""files"". The appconfig system then reads any json-typed variables, dumps the raw json into the ""file"" contents, and returns it to the variable system. The variable system then looks at the type the user specified. If it's a string, it'll assume the plugin returned a string value. If it's a bool or number, it'll error. If it's anything else, it'll try reading the plugin output from the ""file"" as json, and if that works, surface it up the chain as an hcl snippet input variable, which to my great surprise, just works. It's not great that we're guessing at what kind of data the plugins returned based on the type that the user specified, but I'm not up for a broader overhaul of the system at this point to wire more type information through.",0

This is only used in the very specific case where a docker-pull can't be used because all of the following conditions are met: Access to the registry is not available On-Demand Runner (ODR) is being used As a solution, this plugin allows you to be a sort of ""noop"" that adds a reference to a pre-built Docker image (e.g: in an external CI) in the build stage.",1

The keepalive error is really just noise for the user in that case, and the client failing to send a keepalive isn't something a user should generally act on, so i'm downgrading this to debug level. I've also noticed this log-erroring sometimes on shutdown. I think it's possible for us to call SendMsg in the keepalive routine after CloseSend has been invoked elsewhere, but before the context is cancelled, which yields us a grpc Internal type error from SendMsg. We could avoid this with more mutexes, but I don't think it's worth the complexity to avoid.",0

internal/{server/runner}: Ensure a Deployment is preloaded for Release,0.6110443,cli/runnerinstall: Check if runner is registered to the server before,"Prior to this commit, when a pipeline went to queue a Release job, it didn't pre load the deployment proto with an artifact. The release runner had a built-in assumption that all Deployments it received would have a preloaded artifact attached. So this commit fixes that by listing deployments via the service endpoint that preloads artifacts.",0

[GH-3854],"Prior to this commit, the operation release for a runner would operate assuming that a jobs Release operation would always have a Deployment proto attached to it. This changes in the pipelines world, because we allow for Deployment Refs for queuing jobs ahead of time. Prior to even pipelines, the runner release operation already was extracting out the deployment target from the Release operation, but we'd still try to use the deployment on the job proto instead. This commit resolves that by making sure the release runner code uses target.",0

It supports a Release bool, but intentionally does not implement release yet as that will be coming in a follow-up commit/pull request to this one. It also introduces a change in the deploy operation in that if there was no artifact set on the jobs Deploy operation, it looks up the latest pushed artifact to use that. This change is important because pipelines queues its jobs ahead of time all at once, which means if at any point a Build step runs prior, we couldn't look up the artifact without it existing. So the Deploy step will not set the artifact, making it nil, and when the Deploy goes to run it will look up the latest.",0

internal/server: Set expiry time on runner accept,0.45310327,cli/runnerinstall: Check if runner is registered to the server before,"Prior to this commit, Waypoint server only expected queued jobs to wait for 60 seconds before a runner accepted the job and began executing it from its creation time. With the introduction of pipelines, this no longer makes sense because a pipeline will queue all jobs in a pipeline right away. This means downstream jobs could be waiting around to be executing for a while, much longer than 1 minute. This is expected. Given that, this commit updates the server behavior to set a jobs expiry time to something much longer, 60 minutes, and then when the runner goes to accept the job, we update the expiry time to the original expected behavior of 60 seconds, because if the runner has accepted a job to work on, it should run that job fairly quickly like the original intended behavior.",0

[GH-4531],"This commit extends the expiry time for queued jobs from 1 minute to 60 minutes. The reason being that prior to pipelines, we only ever expected queued jobs to be picked up immediately without any downstream jobs. This no longer makes sense given that Pipelines can queue a LOT of jobs at once and it is reasonable that they might wait a while before executing. A future todo here is to set a 60 second time out if a runner is running and has accepted a job. There's no reason we should wait in that instance.",0

Not much work here since we always designed the runner struct from the beginning to support this so there are no data races. This modifies internal/cli so that runners in non-ODR run in parallel mode by default. ODR doesn't make sense to have any parallelism since they always run exactly one job. Non-ODR runners typically ONLY launch ODR tasks, which are highly IO-bound, so we default to a multiple above CPU count for concurrency. This is a necessary pre-requisite for pipelines since they'll likely perform blocking jobs on the static runners to ""watch"" tasks. Today, tasks are launched and stopped, but not watched so this is not an issue.",1

In practice, this doesn't change any behavior - operations always come in ordered by sequence id, descending.

This can be used along with depends_on to create an ordered chain of jobs that are executed even if a dependency fails. The use case for this is ODR because we want to do the following: ┌───────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐ │               │        │   Real Job    │        │               │ │   Start ODR   │◀───────│ (Build, etc.) │◀───────│   Stop ODR    │ │               │        │               │        │               │ └───────────────┘        └───────────────┘        └───────────────┘         ▲                                                 │         │                                                 │         └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘                            Allows Failure We want ""stop ODR"" to run NO MATTER WHAT to try to stop the launched ODR. We definitely want this to run if the ""real job"" failed, and we probably want it to run even if ""start ODR"" failed just in case we can stop some sort of dangling runner (depends on the error condition). Without this feature, we could only stop ODR if everything succeeded OR force ourselves to maintain external state to call stop ODR. This feature lets us just leverage the job system.",0

Increase failure threshold from 5 to 20.,0.39378473,BUG FIXES:,"Currently, by default, waypoint is timing out the deployment if the pod isn't ready in under a minute. This often isn't enough time, especially for an initial deployment that needs to download a docker image, or for large spring-boot apps that take a while to initialize. Increasing the failure threshold to 30 will increase the timeout to 5 minutes, which should be enough time the majority of apps to pull and start. Users with quick-starting apps (or very slow apps) can change this in their k8s config by modifying pod.container.failure_threshold: link This is a tough balance - it isn't uncommon to deploy an app that won't ever become healthy, and users often won't start investigating until waypoint times out and reports the failure. If we time out sooner, users can start debugging sooner, and they would appreciate that cycle being faster. I think that waypoint giving up too early on a working app is a pretty bad failure mode though - it isn't obvious what the problem is, or how to fix itby changing config.",0

init: disable plugin check for now,0.43151033,plugin/ecs: Enable custom health checks for ECS plugin. [GH-4473],"With the introduction of input variables, it is possible to use input variables in a way that waypoint init cannot actually load the configuration. This is because we don't actually render input variables in the CLI (because we may not have all values). The solution is to move this into a runner operation. We've already started this process with the work we did in 0.6 around InitOp, but we don't yet call this from the CLI. For now, for 0.6, we just disable this init check. This was a safety check anyways and has no practical implications so we can turn it off. We'll turn it back on once we switch to remote operations.",0

cli/uninstall: Add more validation to requested platform for uninstall,0.6457917,"cli/uninstall: Remove hard requirement on platform flag, attempt to read server platform from server context. Platform flag overrides anything set in a server platform context [GH-2052]","Prior to this commit, the CLI uninstall command assumed that the platform requested matched the server platform. This could be confusing if a user has both a docker platform server and a local server from waypoint server run. This commit adds some extra validation with the platform requested by loading the server platform and taking into account what platform was requested. This commit also changes the hard requirement that the uninstall command needs a platform flag. If a server context has a platform set, and no platform flag was requested, use that platform instead. Note that the platform flag, if requested, always overrides what the server context has. This is because some early versions of Waypoint do not set the Platform context. If the flag and server platform conflift, we'll print a note to say we're honoring the platform flag requested. Fixes #2046",0

Redacting env vars from stateJson to not expose secrets Better backwards compat Also using new ByName helper func to find declared resources Stripping leading ""/"" from docker container name. Turns out docker containers have a leading / when they on the local docker daemon: link Status report protobuf tweaks Deprecating resources_health - we don't appear to be using it. Deprecating fields on status report Health that have never been used. Switching DeclaredResourceRef to use name instead of id - turns out name is unique. Introducing a new ""type"" on declaredResource - I thought we could encode ""type"" into this name field, but no dice. Adding a missing Health type for status report resources, which lets us match the sdk proto. plugin/docker: handling missing container Converting plugin -> server declared resources with mapstructure A field name changed, and doing it this way makes it easier to stay in sync in the future. Copying everything from the sdk status report to the server status report Updating test with field name changes Reorder imports Adding docker container IP address. It's not the most useful thing for local docker in particular, but i'm going to try adding it consistently for every resource that has an IP, so that one day we can expose it easily in the UI. Also some better comments Only using docker container info if it's present Also improved handling for missing contiainers Use the safe container name ContainerInfo isn't safe to use down there. Using status error instead of vanilla error Upgrading waypoint-plugin-sdk for real I thought main was up to date, but the changes I need are still in a branch. I think I made this mistake all through a very long rebase, so I should probalby just squash this whole thing before merging. Unbreaking backwards compat on protobufs. I should have seen this one coming. Introducing a new nested Health message broke compat on the existing health field. I've fixed it by introducing a new field and deprecating the old one. We didn't use it.",0

This manifests here: link There is no way to determine of c.cfg.Runner is safe to access. A simplified example of the problem: link I believe so - we don't have any methods on hclConfig that require it to be a pointer.

This code seems to have originally been derived from Terraform's ""templatefile"" which has a non-variadic ""vars"", and so Terraform was correct to assume that argument 1 would always be present. Since Waypoint's version allows omitting it, we'll handle that situation by putting the ""blame"" on the template argument instead, to suggest that it's invalid to refer to any variables inside a template call that doesn't have any variables. The previous incorrect result was originally a panic due to violating the contract HCL expects for function.ArgError, although later versions of HCL handle it by just returning a less-specific error message in that case. This fix therefore boils down to just highlighting a more specific part of the input in the error message HCL will ultimately return.",0

We need to also ensure that we render all the variables for workspace destruction and ""destroy all"" operations. This also changes the behavior slightly so that we render the Waypoint config using variables based on the latest deploy or release. Previously, we'd use the deploy/release we were destroying. The issue is that the configuration we have at the moment is only the current config, so you could get waypoint.hcl parse errors if they used variables that didn't exist at one point or another. Practically, I'd like to update the SDK docs to note that during a destroy operation you only have the config for the current config rather than a point-in-time configuration. You should persist all state you need onto your deployment/release structure. I think that's how all plugins work anyways today but I'll update docs there to be explicit.",0

"internal/{ceb,core,server/singleprocess}: Fix exec stream closure",0.43702543,cli: Introduce new CLI flag -reattach for waypoint pipeline run which will stream,"This fixes a very specific edgecase where if the virtual side of the exec handler sends an Exit message and then cancels the context in quick succession, the server side may not see the message, only the context cancelation. gRPC seems to prioritize the cancelation above pending events, possibly because message sends are not guaranteed (the docs state this). The change then is to wait for the server side to close the stream after the virtual side sends it's exit code. This means that the server side is in control of seeing the messages and shutting down the stream. We also can now simplify the handling of the ExecStream messages by allowing server.Recv() to return any buffered messages even if the context has already been canceled. Effectively, if we check that the context the server stream is using has been canceled on our own, we don't allow the server stream to return any buffered messages. The entrypoint exec code is also simplified by having it depend only on the execclient/exec side by checking exec.Context for readiness when trying to relay messages back to the execclient.",0

Prior to this change, there was a scenario that could exist where EntrypointExecStream would exit before the recv goroutine. When EntrypointExecStream exited, it would close the event channel that the recv goroutine sends to. If the recv goroutine simultaneously had a message buffered, it could try to send to the closed channel. With this change, we moved the channel close into the recv goroutine. This way there is never a send-after-close possibility. The one important detail is that the event channel MUST ALWAYS be closed when the EntrypointExecStream exits, because closing this channel signals to the client side (typically a CLI) that they should exit prematurely. Therefore, I moved the goroutine start up before we send the Open message. This ensures that in every exit scenario, the goroutine is running, recv should get an EOF, and we'll close the channel.",0

"send ""EOF"" event for stdin through exec session when stdin is closed",0.3685962,core: waypoint exec with no TTY won't hang open until a ctrl-c [GH-830],"This adds ""EOF"" awareness for stdin to exec so that stdin can be properly closed on the remote side. Without this, some processes would hang indefinitely waiting for stdin to close. For example, if you run cat | ls (just normally, not via Waypoint), ls hangs forever since it is waiting for stdin to close. For non-interactive stdout and an interactive stdin, we treat stdin as closed. This seems to align with how other Unix tools treat stdin in this case (such as ls). This change requires a full client, server, entrypoint update to work, but is backwards compatible throughout and just falls back to the same buggy behavior. Fixes #826",0

Update ECS plugin for execution and task roles,0.72222835,plugin/aws-ecs: task_role_name is optional [GH-824],"In ECS, there are two concepts for IAM roles: the execution role[1], that allows AWS to make API calls on your behalf, to do things like pull images from ECR and write logs to CloudWatch; and the task role[2], that allows the containers within your task access to whatever resources you need them to. Given we almost always need the execution role, it makes sense to have this created by default if it isn't specified. The task role should not be created by default since we have no way to know what the application requires, but we should allow being able to configure it. Initially this commit allows specifying the name of a role created elsewhere. I suspect though that it might be incredibly useful to be able to define which resources your application needs in waypoint.hcl, and have a role created with those permissions (maybe with a syntax similar to the Terraform aws_iam_policy_document data source[3]). I've renamed the RoleName to ExecutionRoleName to make explicit what these roles are for. [1] link [2] link [3] link",1
