91,Update .changelog/4596.txt,Co-authored-by: Jamie White jamie@jgwhite.co.uk
92,Add changelog,
93,"Fix bug caused by trying to fix bug related to job ""loss""","TLDR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. The source of all of this is ultimate a 3 year old bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/9d34ba23599142a5b2efbdc7a79c7a4ce163f060/internal/server/singleprocess/service_runner.go#L586 That code used = instead of :=, which caused the goroutine to update the 'primary' job local variable used by everything else in the function. So WHEN (not if, as we'll see in a moment) ctx is canceled, job becomes nil, and any code further down in the function will see than nil DEPENDING on the goroutine scheduling order. So, why would the context be canceled? The goroutine defined right after this does defer cancel() when the client disconnects. So due to the magic of goroutine scheduling, it's possible for the server.Recv() goroutine to exit, canceling the context, then the WatchSet goroutine wakes up, because there is a job change (as we just updated it), causing the loop to start and JobById uses a canceled context. We attempted to figure out WHY the job was nil in the past by adding code into the primary select statement at the bottom of the function, which introduced a second pathology: the WatchSet routine pushed a value onto errCh when it used the canceled context, and the 'job is nil' detection code did a non-blocking read on 'errCh' AFTER it read an event (almostly certainly a Complete event btw). We then saw the error and figured ""oh something is weird and wrong"", so we logged and basically orphaned the Complete event because we had no job record to record things with! TLDidR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. I've renamed various other job-related variables that held jobs from 'job' to something else to prevent a similar condition in the future."

243,bolt: Delete config source if ID is invalid UTF-8.,Records in the config_source bucket may contain invalid UTF-8 characters due to how such records were previously added to the database. This commit updates the index initialization to delete these records and re-create them with valid UTF-8 encoding in the key of the record.
244,bug: Fix key for config sources in BoltDB.,"This commit updates how config source records are stored in BoltDB. Previously the key was a uint64 value converted to a byte slice - this is acceptable for BoltDB and reading from it; however, snapshots expect that the database values are UTF-8 encoded, which uint64 is not. This commit therefore converts the uint64 to a string BEFORE converting it to a byte slice, and that is the new ""id"" for a record in the config_source bucket."

In this case, we got a PipelineRun message that's empty with no fields defined, so there should not be any jobs. This fix guards against that to not panic when attempting to look at the list of jobs for a given run. It also simplifies a lot of duplicated code in the inspect command."

Prior to v0.10.4, the unique identifier for each record in the table was the name of the plugin. This was changed in v0.10.4 with the addition of scoped config sources, and now the ID is a hashed value, whose hash structure is defined by the plugin name, scope, and workspace name. This commit therefore deletes any ""old"" records, those whose ID is the name of any known config sourcer plugin, from Bolt DB, and creates new records with the ID correctly hashed. With this fix, users who had config sources prior to v0.10.3 may continue to interact with those config sources, whereas before this commit, they could not, and the config sources were permanently ""stuck"" in the database as they were before upgrading."

485,Updating the terraform configsourcer to emit json values,
486,Supporting json configsourcer values,"This is a bit hacky, mostly because it continues to use existing hacks. The variable system is requesting it's dynamic default vars as ""files"". The appconfig system then reads any json-typed variables, dumps the raw json into the ""file"" contents, and returns it to the variable system. The variable system then looks at the type the user specified. If it's a string, it'll assume the plugin returned a string value. If it's a bool or number, it'll error. If it's anything else, it'll try reading the plugin output from the ""file"" as json, and if that works, surface it up the chain as an hcl snippet input variable, which to my great surprise, just works. It's not great that we're guessing at what kind of data the plugins returned based on the type that the user specified, but I'm not up for a broader overhaul of the system at this point to wire more type information through."

730,fix: Update config source record ID to be the hash of the scope and type.,"The previous commit made the unique ID of a config source the hash of a config source's type, scope and configuration. This commit removes the configuration from that hash, because a change to a config source's configuration should not result in the creation of a new record, but the updation of an existing one for a specific ""type"" of plugin in the same ""scope"". To accommodate this, the config source project index schema was also updated to include an indicator that a config source was specifically for the project level. This is because app-scoped config sources also have the project set, so the project index was matching on project-scoped AND app-scoped config sources - it now will only match on project-scoped config sources."
731,fix: update config source record unique ID.,"The unique ID of a record in the config source ""table"" is no longer the ""type"" of config source. Instead, it is now the hash of the config source's type, scope, and configuration. This makes each entry that is added to the table unique, and thusly not overwritten by other config sources of the same type or scope. This commit also adds another test, and fixes the ordering of params for require.Equal throughout the config source tests."
732,fix: Merge config sources from multiple scopes.,The config sources for the global scoped are merged with those from the project scope as well as the app scope. The config sources for the project scope are merged with those of the app scope.
733,test: Add test for Bolt DB state for multiple global config sources.,
734,"feat: Update protobuf and boltdbstate to support configuration sources scoped by application, project, or workspace, and continues support of the global scope. This commit also updates the Bolt DB state implementation to support these new scopes. The config source index table was updated in this commit to include additional indexes, for project and application, and adds an index dedicated to global config sources.",

Before pipelines, this was fine for ODRs. However, pipelines pass a slice of string to the TaskLaunchInfo struct for the Entrypoint field. The Nomad Docker driver's command field accepts only string, not slice of string. Therefore, any exec steps for pipelines run by Nomad ODRs would fail to start. The entrypoint field of the Nomad Docker driver config does accept a slice of string."

This commit updates the init cli to instead behave more like how the init CLI handles syncing Applications: The smallest structure possible i.e. a name, owner, and a root step. This data gets re-upserted on configsync and before running a pipeline, so this init simply upserts a basic structure on initialiation."

1212,feat(plugins/docker): add docker-ref plugin,"The docker-pull plugin really pulls the image in the case of On Demand Runners. Since we do require there a docker.AccessInfo, we can't avoid pulling the image (because HasRegistry automatically becomes true, and not providing a registry causes an error). To avoid patching docker-pull further, a docker-ref is created. This is only used in the very specific case where a docker-pull can't be used because all of the following conditions are met:  Access to the registry is not available On-Demand Runner (ODR) is being used  As a solution, this plugin allows you to be a sort of ""noop"" that adds a reference to a pre-built Docker image (e.g: in an external CI) in the build stage."

1263,Fix the jobspec plugin status check for canary deployments.,"The Noamd jobspec platform plugin status check would incorrectly report a deployment as partially healthy, if the Nomad job had canary allocations. It is possible for such a deployment to be partially healthy; however canary allocations end up in the ""complete"" state when the deployment is promoted. Therefore, after using the ""release"" lifecycle with the canary plugin, the # of ""complete"" allocs would be > 0, and thusly cause a partially healthy state, regardless of the fact that the app is indeed healthy, and its deployment was just promoted, killing the canaries."

1309,server: Track embedded step refs for pipelines with noop job,"Prior to this commit we would ignore step refs of type pipeline and not generate its own job. This caused an issue where if a embedded pipeline steps parent step was also an embedded pipeline, we wouldn't have a job id to wait on, which would make the step run out of order from its parent. This commit fixes that by tracking the step refs as a noop job, then that job depends on all of its embedded jobs before it's complete. This makes it easier for any consuming steps to wait on the noop job which is essentially the last job of a pipeline."

With this change, we check the existing image to see if it matches hashicorp/waypoint:latest, AND check if that's what the user wanted to upgrade to. If either of those is false, we update the task definition during the upgrade."

The project destroy operation requires this because when the workspace is set by the runner, executing a destroy operation for an app is only possible in that workspace, regardless of the workspace proto that is set on the job for a destroy operation. The Waypoint config is required to be plumbed through because the config is needed to re-init a project when we get a copy of it, so we provide it to the project destroy operation from the runner."

1476,App operation updates.,"This commit updates the deletion of app operations to also be deleted from the in-memory database. Furthermore, when an operation is deleted, its sequence # is decremented. This is necessary because if a project is re-initialized after deletion, new operations would have a sequence # set to the sequence # prior to the project's deletion, plus one. In order to do this, the app and project name for each operation is required. Thus, the full proto is passed to the delete function for each app operation, instead of just a Ref_Operation."
1477,Delete project-associated records in one transaction.,"This commit enables app operations to be deleted with a new function 'delete' that accepts a DB transaction as an input parameter. This allows the delete logic for each of them to be called during an existing transaction without causing a deadlock. Furthermore, non-app operation records, like pipelines or triggers, are now similarly called, in that the delete function for each, which allows a transaction to be passed as an input parameter, is used."

1773,server: Handle building graphs with same node names,"Prior to this commit, building a graph of pipelines and embedded pipelines had an issue if the nested pipeline steps had step names that matched any other step from another pipeline. This in practice is valid to have step names be similar to other pipelines but when we combine them and use them to constrct a graph to determine dependencies, we can't re-use that name because we expect node names in the graph to be unique. This commit fixes this by assigning node IDs to each node in a graph, and storing a pipeline step ref to node Id map that we can look up later when we need the step and pipeline names."
1774,server: Build dependency graph across pipelines prior to Run,"This commit builds the full Pipeline run graph with associated jobs prior to running the pipeline. It will also detect cycles between embedded pipelines if any exist. To prevent cycles while building a dependency graph, we include visisted nodes and pipelines so that if we visit a node we've already been to, we simply move on rather than continuing through the cycle"

1781,internal/config: PipelineProtos translates nested pipelines,"This commit updates the config sync func PipelineProtos to read a nested pipeline, either defined directly within a Step stanza, or as a simple pipeline Owner ref, and turns that HCL data into Pipeline protobufs. If an externally referenced pipeline is defined, the step will be a Pipeline step ref to be looked up later at execution time. If the pipeline is defined directly inside the step stanza, this function will configure the Pipeline separately as its own pipeline, and update the step stanza it was defined in to reference that pipeline. This commit does not check for cycles yet."
1782,server: proto gen,
1783,server/proto: Add a pipeline reference to Steps,
1784,internal/config: Add support for single nested pipeline in a step,This commit adds support for nesting an embedded pipeline within a step of a parent pipeline.
1785,Making keepalive send errors quieter.,"With the old log level, if there's a problem with the server connection, we'd usually log two errors - one for the currently active stream (like RunnerConfig), and also an inline keepalive error. The keepalive error is really just noise for the user in that case, and the client failing to send a keepalive isn't something a user should generally act on, so i'm downgrading this to debug level. I've also noticed this log-erroring sometimes on shutdown. I think it's possible for us to call SendMsg in the keepalive routine after CloseSend has been invoked elsewhere, but before the context is cancelled, which yields us a grpc Internal type error from SendMsg. We could avoid this with more mutexes, but I don't think it's worth the complexity to avoid."

The reason for doing this is that, technically, we're using the Authorization header wrong anyway, we don't put a type before the value, which is the proper convention. Additionally, by moving the token to it's own header, the system can perform a different primary authentication (such as with oauth) via the Authentication header and still pass the token along side, which can be used for authorization."
1881,"When auth'ing via oauth2, pass the waypoint token as well via grpc","The waypoint token is used as an identification document as well, so we need the server to see it as well, such that we can validate the identity even after oauth2 has authenticated the user. Effectively, oauth2 is authentication, the waypoint token is used for authorization."

So this commit fixes that by listing deployments via the service endpoint that preloads artifacts."
2098,internal/runner: Use target rather than the Deployment on the job operation,"Prior to this commit, the operation release for a runner would operate assuming that a jobs Release operation would always have a Deployment proto attached to it. This changes in the pipelines world, because we allow for Deployment Refs for queuing jobs ahead of time. Prior to even pipelines, the runner release operation already was extracting out the deployment target from the Release operation, but we'd still try to use the deployment on the job proto instead. This commit resolves that by making sure the release runner code uses target."
2099,Fix doc comment typo,
2100,"internal/{server,runner}: Queue a Release job via a pipeline step","This commit updates the pipeline run service API func to queue a Release job if requested from a pipeline step.

2101,"internal/{server,config}: Add Release reserved pipeline step",This commit introduces parsing the resereved release step.

It supports a Release bool, but intentionally does not implement release yet as that will be coming in a follow-up commit/pull request to this one. It also introduces a change in the deploy operation in that if there was no artifact set on the jobs Deploy operation, it looks up the latest pushed artifact to use that. This change is important because pipelines queues its jobs ahead of time all at once, which means if at any point a Build step runs prior, we couldn't look up the artifact without it existing. So the Deploy step will not set the artifact, making it nil, and when the Deploy goes to run it will look up the latest."

2108,pr feedback: remove initial expire time from run job,
2109,Add func method doc,
2110,internal/server: Set expiry time on runner accept,"Prior to this commit, Waypoint server only expected queued jobs to wait for 60 seconds before a runner accepted the job and began executing it from its creation time. With the introduction of pipelines, this no longer makes sense because a pipeline will queue all jobs in a pipeline right away. This means downstream jobs could be waiting around to be executing for a while, much longer than 1 minute. This is expected. Given that, this commit updates the server behavior to set a jobs expiry time to something much longer, 60 minutes, and then when the runner goes to accept the job, we update the expiry time to the original expected behavior of 60 seconds, because if the runner has accepted a job to work on, it should run that job fairly quickly like the original intended behavior."
2111,runner: Update pipeline step op to use job queue handler,
2112,Extend expire time for queued jobs,"This commit extends the expiry time for queued jobs from 1 minute to 60 minutes. The reason being that prior to pipelines, we only ever expected queued jobs to be picked up immediately without any downstream jobs. This no longer makes sense given that Pipelines can queue a LOT of jobs at once and it is reasonable that they might wait a while before executing. A future todo here is to set a 60 second time out if a runner is running and has accepted a job. There's no reason we should wait in that instance."

2231,Fix ordering of service names for ECS runner uninstall.,"The AWS SDK can possibly return a service for a cluster that no longer exists. Because of this, the FindServices call in Uninstall for the ECS runner finds the 'ghost' service and attempts to uninstall that, never deleting the actual intended service. Because of this, the ordering of the service names has been fixed to check for the ""old"" runner service name first, waypoint-runner."

Some cases where the upstream provider is incompatible with the default name because of limitations on their end make it so that waypoint is unable to be used within those providers. In my testing the DigitalOcean CSI provider doesn't handle capitalization of the volume's name. I suspect other providers may have different requirements which we should be able to work around since there is not an explicit requirement in the CSI spec for the names of volumes within a provider.

2379,fix: Uninstall old runner as part of docker upgrade,Before this commit if docker was being upgraded the uninstallation code would attempt to find the new runner name instead of the pre 0.9.0 name.

This was due to the TaskResources field being expected to exist in a task plugin despite being optional. The fix, similar to how we handle resource plugin configs in kubernetes, is to make the Resources block a pointer so that when it's unset, the plugin config parser doesn't expect it to be required.

The workaround here is: server impls that want to use our tests will need to implement a TestServerImpl interface, that creates public equivalents to their private methods.

This means Waypoint would then faill back to try to use Docker inside a container for the build step.

2815,runner: static runners accept multiple jobs in parallel,"This modifies internal/runner to support accepting multiple jobs in parallel. Not much work here since we always designed the runner struct from the beginning to support this so there are no data races. This modifies internal/cli so that runners in non-ODR run in parallel mode by default. ODR doesn't make sense to have any parallelism since they always run exactly one job. Non-ODR runners typically ONLY launch ODR tasks, which are highly IO-bound, so we default to a multiple above CPU count for concurrency. This is a necessary pre-requisite for pipelines since they'll likely perform blocking jobs on the static runners to ""watch"" tasks. Today, tasks are launched and stopped, but not watched so this is not an issue."

This means the singletonId for the Job included a double slash, such as: poll-trigger/go-gitops-0//default Where the application was not set for the job.

3222,CLI respects server ordering,"It's up to the server to choose the order (based on the -order-by and -desc flags). NOTE: the server, in practice, doesn't respect any of the ordering flags. It only references the COMPLETE_TIME index (in app_operation), and totally ignores -desc and -order-by=start-time options. In practice, this doesn't change any behavior - operations always come in ordered by sequence id, descending. But this opens the door for us to fix this in the server later (or for other server implementations to do this right)."

Note this vulnerability is not in any released Waypoint version, so there is no broad communication necessary. We were not validating the runner token against the runner identity for RunnerJobStream. So long as the token was valid, any runner could request a job impersonating any other runner. This did require that the runner was authenticated already. This adds token verification and a unit test to validate it."

This leads to a panic immediately after when we attempt to set environment variables from the ODR config for the job on a nil config. This commit fixes that by returning an error if the requested ODR config does not exist in the state database."

3501,ci: remove ember-test parallelism,"Closes #2923 Turns out we don’t actually have ember-exam installed, so we were just running exactly the same set of tests twice. We might want to try out ember-exam again in future, but for now our test suite is reasonably quick (~2m) so it’s probably not worth the bother."
3502,ui: rearrange deployment routes,"This is a breaking change in two ways:  Paths that used to be like this:    /{workspace}/{project}/app/{app}/deployment/seq/{seq}    Are now like this:/{workspace}/{project}/app/{app}/deployments/{seq} The legacy ID-based deployment routing is gone entirely  Originally I didn’t intend to make any breaking changes, but doing so dramatically simplified the codebase so overall it seemed worthwhile. We are pre-1.0 after all, and I think users will be able to recover from a 404 reasonably easily. Feel free to push back on this assertion."

3661,internal/server: Cache Horizon URL Name and Host for Deploy Bundle,"Prior to this commit, when crafting a Deploy bundle, we would include the applications deployment URL for each deployment in the bundle. Looking up this hostname requires making an HTTP request to Horizon. The way this was originally written, we would look up that URL for all requested deployments. If a user had 80+ deployments in the bolt db, this request would take quite some time. Given that each applications deployment vanity name and hostname should be the same, and only differs by the deployment sequence, we don't need to get the hostname for each requested deployment. Instead we can grab it once, and use it for the remaining deployments in the bundle. Fixes #2304"

4214,Implement list runners,"Very basic first implementation of list runners. The immediate need for this is to determine if any remote runners exist, so we can decide if we can execute projects remotely vs locally. This doesn't entirely meet that need - because runners aren't currently marked as remote vs cli, there's no way to tell if a runner is remote, or just some other user who happens to be running a CLI command with a local runner. For my immediate purposes though, that kind of false-positive isn't a dealbreaker. We can add more filter capabilities in the future if we need to."

This is generally ok, however if the Nomad job fails to get started a moment later (like a static runner failing to connect back to Waypoint Server), the runner allocation would exit later but the server install command would consider the installation successful. This commit fixes that by doing a few retries on the scheduled allocation once its in a ""running"" state to ensure it properly started up beyond the first few moments of the job. Fixes #2683"

A full-fidelity solution would include modelling and simulating Job, which is one of the largest and most complex protobufs in the system, and therefore more work than is currently justified (in my opinion). As we push further into introspecting data about jobs, I’m pretty confident the situation the time to dive into simulating Job will clearly present itself. Closes #2680"

4308,"support arm64 for the entrypoint, inject properly",This adds a linux/arm64 entrypoint asset to our Waypoint binary. This increases binary size by ~30% but I think this is worthwhile as more of the world's dev and deployment machines move to arm64. This makes it so that Docker entrypoint injection injects the entrypoint binary that matches the architecture and errors if it detects an unsupported architecture. This also adds detection for cloud native buildpacks to warn if the Docker daemon isn't x86_64 since Buildpacks currently have issues with arm64.

This patch removes the dynamic config var and the final dropdown click from the test, as neither are material to the behavior under test."

4501,internal/server/state: job creation happens in dependency order,"This does two things: (1) Checks that jobs being created have no cycles between each other. We only need to check ""between each other"" because job creation requires all dependencies already exist. This means that previously created jobs new jobs might depend on can't possibly cycle. Therefore, we only need to check for cycles amongst newly created jobs. (2) Use a topological sort over the dependencies to ensure that we're creating the jobs in the correct order. This allows JobCreate(C, B, A) to work even if the order of the jobs to run based on deps is A, B, C This brings in the graph package from go-argmapper, a graph package that is fairly proven at this point; there have been no graph bugs since releasing Waypoint and it has full test coverage."

4520,internal/server: support job dependencies that can fail,"This introduces a new field to jobs depends_on_allow_failures that is a list of IDs that are dependencies that are allowed to fail. This can be used along with depends_on to create an ordered chain of jobs that are executed even if a dependency fails. The use case for this is ODR because we want to do the following: ┌───────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐ │               │        │   Real Job    │        │               │ │   Start ODR   │◀───────│ (Build, etc.) │◀───────│   Stop ODR    │ │               │        │               │        │               │ └───────────────┘        └───────────────┘        └───────────────┘         ▲                                                 │         │                                                 │         └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘                            Allows Failure We want ""stop ODR"" to run NO MATTER WHAT to try to stop the launched ODR. We definitely want this to run if the ""real job"" failed, and we probably want it to run even if ""start ODR"" failed just in case we can stop some sort of dangling runner (depends on the error condition). Without this feature, we could only stop ODR if everything succeeded OR force ourselves to maintain external state to call stop ODR. This feature lets us just leverage the job system."

4632,Setting FailureThreshold for Liveness and Readiness checks,"This is necessary because we only have the one ""probe"" config, which we're using for liveness and readiness."
4633,update docs,
4634,Increase failure threshold from 5 to 20.,"Currently, by default, waypoint is timing out the deployment if the pod isn't ready in under a minute. This often isn't enough time, especially for an initial deployment that needs to download a docker image, or for large spring-boot apps that take a while to initialize. Increasing the failure threshold to 30 will increase the timeout to 5 minutes, which should be enough time the majority of apps to pull and start. Users with quick-starting apps (or very slow apps) can change this in their k8s config by modifying pod.container.failure_threshold: https://tip.waypointproject.io/plugins/kubernetes#pod-container-probe-failure_threshold This is a tough balance - it isn't uncommon to deploy an app that won't ever become healthy, and users often won't start investigating until waypoint times out and reports the failure. If we time out sooner, users can start debugging sooner, and they would appreciate that cycle being faster. I think that waypoint giving up too early on a working app is a pretty bad failure mode though - it isn't obvious what the problem is, or how to fix itby changing config."

On command completion, we want to wait for the stdout copy to finish before actually exiting. This also fixes our #1 flaky test, which I believe was not in fact false positive flaky, but was REAL positive flaky; I think this was a bug."

4737,Merge pull request #2479 from hashicorp/bug/init,init: disable plugin check for now
4738,init: disable plugin check for now,"With the introduction of input variables, it is possible to use input variables in a way that waypoint init cannot actually load the configuration. This is because we don't actually render input variables in the CLI (because we may not have all values). The solution is to move this into a runner operation. We've already started this process with the work we did in 0.6 around InitOp, but we don't yet call this from the CLI. For now, for 0.6, we just disable this init check. This was a safety check anyways and has no practical implications so we can turn it off. We'll turn it back on once we switch to remote operations."

This implementation feels ok to me, but it very well might be too clever/esoteric, and i'm open to just doing it the longform way if anyone hates this."

4976,ui: ensure ember-cli-flash doesn’t clobber pds-flash-messages,"This is a pretty subtle bug. By default, ember-cli-flash automatically injects a flashMessages service into various types such as routes and controllers. This is a problem for us because it clobbers our custom PdsFlashMessages service. As a result, you could inject the service into a route and it would refuse to work for no apparent reason. It looks like the ember-cli-flash maintainers intended to remove the automatic injections for v2.0.0 but didn’t actually do so."

When a deployment fails, print out non Info events from the pods to    help the user diagonise what happened. Provide some small grace period on pod cleanup to allow for the    potential of debugging the failed pods directly. Handle not being able to search for metric pods Handle destroying an old deployment that didn't have autoscaling    defined yet. Setup the kubernetes service with the workspace name if the workspace    is not the default workspace"

This ended up in behavior that worked as ""intended"" in this broken case: sometimes you'd get workspace-scoped prioritizing over non-workspace-scoped and vice versa. This clarifies the resolution to note that a variable with a workspace set takes higher priority over one without a variable set, and encodes this rule into the sort logic.

Given our installation method on all platforms defaults our gRPC to port 9701, it makes sense to default to port 9701 if none is specified. This makes the initial installation login experience smoother cause most installations can just do: $ waypoint login  And it'll just work, rather than looking up the port, which is most likely 9701."

5225,internal/server/state: peek should return blocked jobs,"We use Peek to check if there is any potential candidate jobs for a runner, not a guarantee that it will immediately be assigned that job. In the scenario where a job is blocked (defined below), peek would return nil which broke the on-demand runner use case that used peek to verify a job exists for a runner. A job is ""blocked"" when another job is already assigned for the same (app, project, workspace) tuple. This serializes operations for that tuple to prevent concurrency issues but still allow concurrency across projects/apps/workspaces."

In the case of ember-cli-flash, it’s super() that the does the work of registering custom convenience methods, so super happily defines error, and then the line added by typescript overwrites it with void 0 and we end up with no error method to call."

5751,cli/uninstall: Add more validation to requested platform for uninstall,"Prior to this commit, the CLI uninstall command assumed that the platform requested matched the server platform. This could be confusing if a user has both a docker platform server and a local server from waypoint server run. This commit adds some extra validation with the platform requested by loading the server platform and taking into account what platform was requested. This commit also changes the hard requirement that the uninstall command needs a platform flag. If a server context has a platform set, and no platform flag was requested, use that platform instead. Note that the platform flag, if requested, always overrides what the server context has. This is because some early versions of Waypoint do not set the Platform context. If the flag and server platform conflift, we'll print a note to say we're honoring the platform flag requested. Fixes #2046"

Redacting env vars from stateJson to not expose secrets Better backwards compat Also using new ByName helper func to find declared resources Stripping leading ""/"" from docker container name. Turns out docker containers have a leading / when they on the local docker daemon: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6705 Status report protobuf tweaks  Deprecating resources_health - we don't appear to be using it. Deprecating fields on status report Health that have never been used. Switching DeclaredResourceRef to use name instead of id - turns out name is unique. Introducing a new ""type"" on declaredResource - I thought we could encode ""type"" into this name field, but no dice. Adding a missing Health type for status report resources, which lets us match the sdk proto.  plugin/docker: handling missing container Converting plugin -> server declared resources with mapstructure A field name changed, and doing it this way makes it easier to stay in sync in the future. Copying everything from the sdk status report to the server status report Updating test with field name changes Reorder imports Adding docker container IP address. It's not the most useful thing for local docker in particular, but i'm going to try adding it consistently for every resource that has an IP, so that one day we can expose it easily in the UI. Also some better comments Only using docker container info if it's present Also improved handling for missing contiainers Use the safe container name ContainerInfo isn't safe to use down there. Using status error instead of vanilla error Upgrading waypoint-plugin-sdk for real I thought main was up to date, but the changes I need are still in a branch. I think I made this mistake all through a very long rebase, so I should probalby just squash this whole thing before merging. Unbreaking backwards compat on protobufs. I should have seen this one coming. Introducing a new nested Health message broke compat on the existing health field. I've fixed it by introducing a new field and deprecating the old one. We didn't use it."

6791,Not embedding hclConfig as a pointer.,"This addresses the panic within https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1704. The problem here is that, if you embed a pointer to a private struct, and the private struct is nil, the caller has no way to determine if the embedded struct's values are safe to access. This manifests here: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/main/internal/cli/base.go#L253 There is no way to determine of c.cfg.Runner is safe to access. A simplified example of the problem: https://play.golang.org/p/sbAPT2HGJqW I believe so - we don't have any methods on hclConfig that require it to be a pointer. We also never statefully maniuplate it outside of the context of cfg, as far as I can see. I've tested this locally and it doesn't seem to break anything."

6831,config/funcs: template functions to return valid ArgError values,"The template functions are all defined with a variadic parameter to collect zero or more ""vars"" maps, but that means we need to be careful to handle the case where there are no vars maps at all. This code seems to have originally been derived from Terraform's ""templatefile"" which has a non-variadic ""vars"", and so Terraform was correct to assume that argument 1 would always be present. Since Waypoint's version allows omitting it, we'll handle that situation by putting the ""blame"" on the template argument instead, to suggest that it's invalid to refer to any variables inside a template call that doesn't have any variables. The previous incorrect result was originally a panic due to violating the contract HCL expects for function.ArgError, although later versions of HCL handle it by just returning a less-specific error message in that case. This fix therefore boils down to just highlighting a more specific part of the input in the error message HCL will ultimately return."

7148,Install the correct version of mockery.,"Without specifying the package, nothing gets installed. Without injecting the version via ldflags, mockery prepends the wrong version number (v1.0.0) to all of the mocks that it generates. I do not love hard-coding 1.1.2 in here, but this seems unlikely to change frequently and I don't see another path. I was hoping to use some a bash subcommand to extract the version with something like the following, but it doesn't work with go install and is kind of hacky also. //go:generate go install ""-ldflags=-s -w -X github.com/vektra/mockery/mockery.SemVer=$(go mod graph | grep 'github.com/hashicorp/waypoint github.com/vektra/mockery' | awk -F '\@v' '{print $2}')"" github.com/vektra/mockery/cmd/mockery"

We need to also ensure that we render all the variables for workspace destruction and ""destroy all"" operations. This also changes the behavior slightly so that we render the Waypoint config using variables based on the latest deploy or release. Previously, we'd use the deploy/release we were destroying. The issue is that the configuration we have at the moment is only the current config, so you could get waypoint.hcl parse errors if they used variables that didn't exist at one point or another. Practically, I'd like to update the SDK docs to note that during a destroy operation you only have the config for the current config rather than a point-in-time configuration. You should persist all state you need onto your deployment/release structure. I think that's how all plugins work anyways today but I'll update docs there to be explicit."

The change then is to wait for the server side to close the stream after the virtual side sends it's exit code. This means that the server side is in control of seeing the messages and shutting down the stream. We also can now simplify the handling of the ExecStream messages by allowing server.Recv() to return any buffered messages even if the context has already been canceled. Effectively, if we check that the context the server stream is using has been canceled on our own, we don't allow the server stream to return any buffered messages. The entrypoint exec code is also simplified by having it depend only on the execclient/exec side by checking exec.Context for readiness when trying to relay messages back to the execclient."

8264,internal/cli: Add ability to start an exec plugin for a session,"The semantics here are a bit simplicist but they should work. Basically if there are no instances for a deployment, we try to generate one by using an exec plugin. For platforms that don't have an exec plugin, it will simply error out. A better way to implement this would be to check if the platform supports an exec plugin, and if so only use it. But checking for this fact requires booting the plugin, and booting the plugin requires the runner config, and thus it's just easier to do it this more simplistic way."

It is expected that long-running streams such as the log stream will be disconnected periodically due to any number of reasons, but most commonly a load balancer in the middle limiting connection times. In this scenario, we quickly reconnect and its not an issue. It creates too much noise to log every disconnect as an error. However, if we fail to reconnect the log stream, it is an error that should be noted."

This means that logs will appear even if the child command is not entering the ""ready to start case"", which was happening when poorly behaved config sources were blocking. Internally, this  changes our state tracking in the CEB to use bools and a condition var. Previously we were using an atomic+channel. This changes the requirement to one shared cond var + bool per state. We aren't using a state enum because these are not mutually exclusive states, we can have both states true at once."

8635,internal/server: fix send-after-close possibility,"I could never reproduce this bug nor write a test for it since it was racey in nature but eyeball-tracing I belive this is the fix. Prior to this change, there was a scenario that could exist where EntrypointExecStream would exit before the recv goroutine. When EntrypointExecStream exited, it would close the event channel that the recv goroutine sends to. If the recv goroutine simultaneously had a message buffered, it could try to send to the closed channel. With this change, we moved the channel close into the recv goroutine. This way there is never a send-after-close possibility. The one important detail is that the event channel MUST ALWAYS be closed when the EntrypointExecStream exits, because closing this channel signals to the client side (typically a CLI) that they should exit prematurely. Therefore, I moved the goroutine start up before we send the Open message. This ensures that in every exit scenario, the goroutine is running, recv should get an EOF, and we'll close the channel."

8832,"send ""EOF"" event for stdin through exec session when stdin is closed","This adds ""EOF"" awareness for stdin to exec so that stdin can be properly closed on the remote side. Without this, some processes would hang indefinitely waiting for stdin to close. For example, if you run cat | ls (just normally, not via Waypoint), ls hangs forever since it is waiting for stdin to close. For non-interactive stdout and an interactive stdin, we treat stdin as closed. This seems to align with how other Unix tools treat stdin in this case (such as ls). This change requires a full client, server, entrypoint update to work, but is backwards compatible throughout and just falls back to the same buggy behavior. Fixes #826"

9044,Updated comment about GitLab images,"Add more context on use GitLab created images, which may not match official checksums."
9045,Merge pull request #694 from alberto/patch-1,Fix typo in docs
9046,Change Image used by GitLab CI/CD,"Instead of downloading the images on every run, GitLab provides regularly updated custom images for Waypoint hosted on GitLab's container registry for every version and the latest version tagged with latest."
9047,Fix typo in docs,secrete -> secret
9048,Update ECS plugin for execution and task roles,"In ECS, there are two concepts for IAM roles: the execution role[1], that allows AWS to make API calls on your behalf, to do things like pull images from ECR and write logs to CloudWatch; and the task role[2], that allows the containers within your task access to whatever resources you need them to. Given we almost always need the execution role, it makes sense to have this created by default if it isn't specified. The task role should not be created by default since we have no way to know what the application requires, but we should allow being able to configure it. Initially this commit allows specifying the name of a role created elsewhere. I suspect though that it might be incredibly useful to be able to define which resources your application needs in waypoint.hcl, and have a role created with those permissions (maybe with a syntax similar to the Terraform aws_iam_policy_document data source[3]). I've renamed the RoleName to ExecutionRoleName to make explicit what these roles are for.

But for now this will band-aid a situation where deploys cant be destroyed even though they don't exist.

This is useful in the brownfield scenario where Waypoint isn't [currently] owning the build. You can just pull in your existing built images and run with it. Example: hcl app ""web"" {     build {         use ""docker-pull"" {             image = ""hashicorp/http-echo""             tag   = ""latest""         }     } }"

9489,ui: send users to workspaces after onboarding,"This  tag was leftover I think from some early work on the onboarding feature. It was never replaced because it ""worked"" as in, it sent you to a page with the projects visible, but because of how the routing works it just quietly set projects as the workspace to filter all operations on. So, you'd get a non-error state but no operations. A couple things we may want to do in the future:  On the server side, reject filters by workspace where the   workspace doesn't exist In the UI, check the existence of a workspace when you   load the /:workspace route  Either one of those would have caught this."

By specifying spec.Result to nil, the original results of the callback function are preserved, because we expect this to NOT be a mapper (or rather: to be a target function) and we want the real original results. This is non-sensible behavior for a single function, so I'm going to follow up with a change to change this behavior into two separate functions."

This is used to deflake our tests and removes a test that would block on my machine like 50% of the time. I ran the test 1000 times on my machine without a failure after this patch. The CEB itself ignores this message and it is unused currently. We could use this message in the future as a timeout mechanism for starting an exec session. If the opened message isn't received in sufficient time, we could end our exec session."
