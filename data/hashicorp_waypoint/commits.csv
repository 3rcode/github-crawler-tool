131,Update .changelog/4596.txt,Co-authored-by: Jamie White link
132,Add changelog,
133,"Fix bug caused by trying to fix bug related to job ""loss""","TLDR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. The source of all of this is ultimate a 3 year old bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/9d34ba23599142a5b2efbdc7a79c7a4ce163f060/internal/server/singleprocess/service_runner.go#L586 That code used module instead of module, which caused the goroutine to update the 'primary' job local variable used by everything else in the function. So WHEN (not if, as we'll see in a moment) ctx is canceled, job becomes nil, and any code further down in the function will see than nil DEPENDING on the goroutine scheduling order. So, why would the context be canceled? The goroutine defined right after this does module when the client disconnects. So due to the magic of goroutine scheduling, it's possible for the module goroutine to exit, canceling the context, then the WatchSet goroutine wakes up, because there is a job change (as we just updated it), causing the loop to start and JobById uses a canceled context. We attempted to figure out WHY the job was nil in the past by adding code into the primary select statement at the bottom of the function, which introduced a second pathology: the WatchSet routine pushed a value onto errCh when it used the canceled context, and the 'job is nil' detection code did a non-blocking read on 'errCh' AFTER it read an event (almostly certainly a Complete event btw). We then saw the error and figured ""oh something is weird and wrong"", so we logged and basically orphaned the Complete event because we had no job record to record things with! TLDidR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. I've renamed various other job-related variables that held jobs from 'job' to something else to prevent a similar condition in the future."

284,bolt: Delete config source if ID is invalid UTF-8.,Records in the config_source bucket may contain invalid UTF-8 characters due to how such records were previously added to the database. This commit updates the index initialization to delete these records and re-create them with valid UTF-8 encoding in the key of the record.
285,bug: Fix key for config sources in BoltDB.,"This commit updates how config source records are stored in BoltDB. Previously the key was a uint64 value converted to a byte slice - this is acceptable for BoltDB and reading from it; however, snapshots expect that the database values are UTF-8 encoded, which uint64 is not. This commit therefore converts the uint64 to a string BEFORE converting it to a byte slice, and that is the new ""id"" for a record in the config_source bucket."

483,bolt: Fix pre-v0.10.4 config sources.,"This commit updates the Bolt DB implementation of config sources to ""upgrade"" a pre-v0.10.4 database record from the config_source table. Prior to v0.10.4, the unique identifier for each record in the table was the name of the plugin. This was changed in v0.10.4 with the addition of scoped config sources, and now the ID is a hashed value, whose hash structure is defined by the plugin name, scope, and workspace name. This commit therefore deletes any ""old"" records, those whose ID is the name of any known config sourcer plugin, from Bolt DB, and creates new records with the ID correctly hashed. With this fix, users who had config sources prior to v0.10.3 may continue to interact with those config sources, whereas before this commit, they could not, and the config sources were permanently ""stuck"" in the database as they were before upgrading."

526,Updating the terraform configsourcer to emit json values,
527,Supporting json configsourcer values,"This is a bit hacky, mostly because it continues to use existing hacks. The variable system is requesting it's dynamic default vars as ""files"". The appconfig system then reads any json-typed variables, dumps the raw json into the ""file"" contents, and returns it to the variable system. The variable system then looks at the type the user specified. If it's a string, it'll assume the plugin returned a string value. If it's a bool or number, it'll error. If it's anything else, it'll try reading the plugin output from the ""file"" as json, and if that works, surface it up the chain as an hcl snippet input variable, which to my great surprise, just works. It's not great that we're guessing at what kind of data the plugins returned based on the type that the user specified, but I'm not up for a broader overhaul of the system at this point to wire more type information through."

769,fix: sort config sources based on resolution rules.,"Update the config sources returned by the server to be returned in such a way that the least-specific scope is first in the slice of config sources, and more-specific config sources are in ascending order."
770,fix: Incorporate workspace name to config source uniqueness.,"This commit updates the addition or update of a config source to consider the workspace scope that is set for the config source. This fixes an issue where setting the config source for a different workspace but at the same scope ""level"" as another config source of the same type would overwrite the existing entry."
771,fix: Update config source record ID to be the hash of the scope and type.,"The previous commit made the unique ID of a config source the hash of a config source's type, scope and configuration. This commit removes the configuration from that hash, because a change to a config source's configuration should not result in the creation of a new record, but the updation of an existing one for a specific ""type"" of plugin in the same ""scope"". To accommodate this, the config source project index schema was also updated to include an indicator that a config source was specifically for the project level. This is because app-scoped config sources also have the project set, so the project index was matching on project-scoped AND app-scoped config sources - it now will only match on project-scoped config sources."
772,fix: update config source record unique ID.,"The unique ID of a record in the config source ""table"" is no longer the ""type"" of config source. Instead, it is now the hash of the config source's type, scope, and configuration. This makes each entry that is added to the table unique, and thusly not overwritten by other config sources of the same type or scope. This commit also adds another test, and fixes the ordering of params for require.Equal throughout the config source tests."
773,fix: Merge config sources from multiple scopes.,The config sources for the global scoped are merged with those from the project scope as well as the app scope. The config sources for the project scope are merged with those of the app scope.
774,test: Add test for Bolt DB state for multiple global config sources.,
775,"feat: Update protobuf and boltdbstate to support configuration sources scoped by application, project, or workspace, and continues support of the global scope. This commit also updates the Bolt DB state implementation to support these new scopes. The config source index table was updated in this commit to include additional indexes, for project and application, and adds an index dedicated to global config sources.",

Before pipelines, this was fine for ODRs. However, pipelines pass a slice of string to the TaskLaunchInfo struct for the Entrypoint field. The Nomad Docker driver's command field accepts only string, not slice of string. Therefore, any exec steps for pipelines run by Nomad ODRs would fail to start.

This commit updates the init cli to instead behave more like how the init CLI handles syncing Applications: The smallest structure possible i.e. a name, owner, and a root step. This data gets re-upserted on configsync and before running a pipeline, so this init simply upserts a basic structure on initialiation."

979,Add changelog,
980,pipeline: Properly determine when pipeline run is complete,"Prior to this commit, when we'd go to complete a pipeline run, we would only look at the ""last"" job in the jobs slice for a pipeline run message. This check doesn't seem to work anymore, and relying on the last job in a slice can be fragile. This commit fixes this behavior by checking all job ids in a pipeline run and seeing if they have finished as well before attempting to mark the pipeline run as a success. Fixes #4032"

1253,feat(plugins/docker): add docker-ref plugin,"The module plugin really pulls the image in the case of On Demand Runners. Since we do require there a module, we can't avoid pulling the image (because HasRegistry automatically becomes true, and not providing a registry causes an error). To avoid patching module further, a module is created. This is only used in the very specific case where a module can't be used because all of the following conditions are met:  Access to the registry is not available On-Demand Runner (ODR) is being used  As a solution, this plugin allows you to be a sort of ""noop"" that adds a reference to a pre-built Docker image (e.g: in an external CI) in the module stage."

1304,Fix the jobspec plugin status check for canary deployments.,"The Noamd jobspec platform plugin status check would incorrectly report a deployment as partially healthy, if the Nomad job had canary allocations. It is possible for such a deployment to be partially healthy; however canary allocations end up in the ""complete"" state when the deployment is promoted. Therefore, after using the ""release"" lifecycle with the canary plugin, the # of ""complete"" allocs would be > 0, and thusly cause a partially healthy state, regardless of the fact that the app is indeed healthy, and its deployment was just promoted, killing the canaries."

1350,server: Track embedded step refs for pipelines with noop job,"Prior to this commit we would ignore step refs of type pipeline and not generate its own job. This caused an issue where if a embedded pipeline steps parent step was also an embedded pipeline, we wouldn't have a job id to wait on, which would make the step run out of order from its parent. This commit fixes that by tracking the step refs as a noop job, then that job depends on all of its embedded jobs before it's complete. This makes it easier for any consuming steps to wait on the noop job which is essentially the last job of a pipeline."

1480,Update version check on server during ECS upgrade.,"Previously during ECS upgrades, if the current server image was hashicorp/waypoint:latest, regardless of user input, the upgrade would just force-redeploy the existing ECS service and not update the image. With this change, we check the existing image to see if it matches hashicorp/waypoint:latest, AND check if that's what the user wanted to upgrade to. If either of those is false, we update the task definition during the upgrade."

The project destroy operation requires this because when the workspace is set by the runner, executing a destroy operation for an app is only possible in that workspace, regardless of the workspace proto that is set on the job for a destroy operation. The Waypoint config is required to be plumbed through because the config is needed to re-init a project when we get a copy of it, so we provide it to the project destroy operation from the runner."

1516,"Removes unused Delete functions for app operations from state interface, and their implementations.",
1517,App operation updates.,"This commit updates the deletion of app operations to also be deleted from the in-memory database. Furthermore, when an operation is deleted, its sequence # is decremented. This is necessary because if a project is re-initialized after deletion, new operations would have a sequence # set to the sequence # prior to the project's deletion, plus one. In order to do this, the app and project name for each operation is required. Thus, the full proto is passed to the delete function for each app operation, instead of just a Ref_Operation."
1518,Delete project-associated records in one transaction.,"This commit enables app operations to be deleted with a new function 'delete' that accepts a DB transaction as an input parameter. This allows the delete logic for each of them to be called during an existing transaction without causing a deadlock. Furthermore, non-app operation records, like pipelines or triggers, are now similarly called, in that the delete function for each, which allows a transaction to be passed as an input parameter, is used."

1814,server: Handle building graphs with same node names,"Prior to this commit, building a graph of pipelines and embedded pipelines had an issue if the nested pipeline steps had step names that matched any other step from another pipeline. This in practice is valid to have step names be similar to other pipelines but when we combine them and use them to constrct a graph to determine dependencies, we can't re-use that name because we expect node names in the graph to be unique. This commit fixes this by assigning node IDs to each node in a graph, and storing a pipeline step ref to node Id map that we can look up later when we need the step and pipeline names."
1815,server: Build dependency graph across pipelines prior to Run,"This commit builds the full Pipeline run graph with associated jobs prior to running the pipeline. It will also detect cycles between embedded pipelines if any exist. To prevent cycles while building a dependency graph, we include visisted nodes and pipelines so that if we visit a node we've already been to, we simply move on rather than continuing through the cycle"

1822,internal/config: PipelineProtos translates nested pipelines,"This commit updates the config sync func PipelineProtos to read a nested pipeline, either defined directly within a Step stanza, or as a simple pipeline Owner ref, and turns that HCL data into Pipeline protobufs. If an externally referenced pipeline is defined, the step will be a Pipeline step ref to be looked up later at execution time. If the pipeline is defined directly inside the step stanza, this function will configure the Pipeline separately as its own pipeline, and update the step stanza it was defined in to reference that pipeline. This commit does not check for cycles yet."
1823,server: proto gen,
1824,server/proto: Add a pipeline reference to Steps,
1825,internal/config: Add support for single nested pipeline in a step,This commit adds support for nesting an embedded pipeline within a step of a parent pipeline.
1826,Making keepalive send errors quieter.,"With the old log level, if there's a problem with the server connection, we'd usually log two errors - one for the currently active stream (like RunnerConfig), and also an inline keepalive error. The keepalive error is really just noise for the user in that case, and the client failing to send a keepalive isn't something a user should generally act on, so i'm downgrading this to debug level. I've also noticed this log-erroring sometimes on shutdown. I think it's possible for us to call SendMsg in the keepalive routine after CloseSend has been invoked elsewhere, but before the context is cancelled, which yields us a grpc Internal type error from SendMsg. We could avoid this with more mutexes, but I don't think it's worth the complexity to avoid."

But the critical bit is that it begins the process of moving the waypoint token away from the Authorization header and to a new Waypoint-Token header in GRPC. The reason for doing this is that, technically, we're using the Authorization header wrong anyway, we don't put a type before the value, which is the proper convention. Additionally, by moving the token to it's own header, the system can perform a different primary authentication (such as with oauth) via the Authentication header and still pass the token along side, which can be used for authorization."
1922,"When auth'ing via oauth2, pass the waypoint token as well via grpc","The waypoint token is used as an identification document as well, so we need the server to see it as well, such that we can validate the identity even after oauth2 has authenticated the user.

2138,internal/{server/runner}: Ensure a Deployment is preloaded for Release,"Prior to this commit, when a pipeline went to queue a Release job, it didn't pre load the deployment proto with an artifact. The release runner had a built-in assumption that all Deployments it received would have a preloaded artifact attached. So this commit fixes that by listing deployments via the service endpoint that preloads artifacts."
2139,internal/runner: Use module rather than the Deployment on the job operation,"Prior to this commit, the operation release for a runner would operate assuming that a jobs Release operation would always have a Deployment proto attached to it. This changes in the pipelines world, because we allow for Deployment Refs for queuing jobs ahead of time. Prior to even pipelines, the runner release operation already was extracting out the deployment target from the Release operation, but we'd still try to use the deployment on the job proto instead. This commit resolves that by making sure the release runner code uses target."
2140,Fix doc comment typo,
2141,"internal/{server,runner}: Queue a Release job via a pipeline step","This commit updates the pipeline run service API func to queue a Release job if requested from a pipeline step. Additionally, because pipelines is expecting to support referencing ""latest"" deployments as well as deployments by sequence numbers, the runner impl for running a Release will now look up the latest deployment if the Job operation configuration for a Deployment was not set i.e. nil."
2142,"internal/{server,config}: Add Release reserved pipeline step",This commit introduces parsing the resereved release step. It also introduces two new kinds of references: Ref_Artifact and Ref_Deployment. This will be important because we need to let users reference a Deployment either via latest (the default) or with a specific deployment sequence number.

It supports a Release bool, but intentionally does not implement release yet as that will be coming in a follow-up commit/pull request to this one. It also introduces a change in the deploy operation in that if there was no artifact set on the jobs Deploy operation, it looks up the latest pushed artifact to use that. This change is important because pipelines queues its jobs ahead of time all at once, which means if at any point a Build step runs prior, we couldn't look up the artifact without it existing. So the Deploy step will not set the artifact, making it nil, and when the Deploy goes to run it will look up the latest."
2147,test: Update job test files with new impl state for db,
2148,pr feedback: Queue reserved step ops in RunPipeline service func,"Rather than modify the runner operation for executing exec steps, this commit updates the pipeline run behavior to queue a resereved build step op when a RunPipeline request queues all of the jobs."
2149,pr feedback: remove initial expire time from run job,
2150,Add func method doc,
2151,internal/server: Set expiry time on runner accept,"Prior to this commit, Waypoint server only expected queued jobs to wait for 60 seconds before a runner accepted the job and began executing it from its creation time. With the introduction of pipelines, this no longer makes sense because a pipeline will queue all jobs in a pipeline right away. This means downstream jobs could be waiting around to be executing for a while, much longer than 1 minute. This is expected. Given that, this commit updates the server behavior to set a jobs expiry time to something much longer, 60 minutes, and then when the runner goes to accept the job, we update the expiry time to the original expected behavior of 60 seconds, because if the runner has accepted a job to work on, it should run that job fairly quickly like the original intended behavior."
2152,runner: Update pipeline step op to use job queue handler,
2153,Extend expire time for queued jobs,"This commit extends the expiry time for queued jobs from 1 minute to 60 minutes. The reason being that prior to pipelines, we only ever expected queued jobs to be picked up immediately without any downstream jobs. This no longer makes sense given that Pipelines can queue a LOT of jobs at once and it is reasonable that they might wait a while before executing. A future todo here is to set a 60 second time out if a runner is running and has accepted a job. There's no reason we should wait in that instance."

2272,Fix ordering of service names for ECS runner uninstall.,"The AWS SDK can possibly return a service for a cluster that no longer exists. Because of this, the FindServices call in Uninstall for the ECS runner finds the 'ghost' service and attempts to uninstall that, never deleting the actual intended service.

2318,core/install: Add --nomad-csi-volume-name flag to install,This commit allows users to specify their own volume names within their CSI provider. Some cases where the upstream provider is incompatible with the default name because of limitations on their end make it so that waypoint is unable to be used within those providers. In my testing the DigitalOcean CSI provider doesn't handle capitalization of the volume's name. I suspect other providers may have different requirements which we should be able to work around since there is not an explicit requirement in the CSI spec for the names of volumes within a provider.

2420,fix: Uninstall old runner as part of docker upgrade,Before this commit if docker was being upgraded the uninstallation code would attempt to find the new runner name instead of the pre 0.9.0 name. This commit finds one from a list of both new and old container names and uninstalls the one that it finds during the uninstall step.

2552,builtin/docker: Do not require module for task launch config,"Prior to this commit, the task launcher was expecting module to be a required plugin config option despite it not actually being required. This was due to the module field being expected to exist in a task plugin despite being optional. The fix, similar to how we handle resource plugin configs in kubernetes, is to make the Resources block a pointer so that when it's unset, the plugin config parser doesn't expect it to be required.

This means Waypoint would then faill back to try to use Docker inside a container for the build step.

2856,runner: static runners accept multiple jobs in parallel,"This modifies module to support accepting multiple jobs in parallel. Not much work here since we always designed the runner struct from the beginning to support this so there are no data races. This modifies module so that runners in non-ODR run in parallel mode by default. ODR doesn't make sense to have any parallelism since they always run exactly one job. Non-ODR runners typically ONLY launch ODR tasks, which are highly IO-bound, so we default to a multiple above CPU count for concurrency. This is a necessary pre-requisite for pipelines since they'll likely perform blocking jobs on the static runners to ""watch"" tasks. Today, tasks are launched and stopped, but not watched so this is not an issue."

3061,Prevent the release of a running deployment,"If the most recently created deployment is running, and you attempt module, prior to this we would attempt to release that unfinished depoyment, and panic downstream in argmapper. With this change, it's still possible for module (with no deployment targeting flag) to pick a running deployment, but at least the user will have a hint as to what has happened and can choose a different deploy to release, or wait, or delete the stuck running deployment."

This is extra tricky because npm and lock files might change which causes module to notify the PR that a failure occured. In reality, this check was only to tell the PR author that they needed to run module to generate CLI docs automatically. This commit updates that behavior to only check a module in the module folder, where the auto generated docs live."

3191,internal: Don't include app if not set on job,"Prior to this commit, our poll operation would set the poll jobs singleton Id to Workspace/Project/Application. However not all project poll operations have an application, such as the initial QueueProject operation. In this case, we only set Workspace and Project. This means the singletonId for the Job included a double slash, such as: poll-trigger/go-gitops-0//default Where the application was not set for the job. This commit fixes this by rearranging the singleton to start at Workspace, Project, and then optionally Application if exists on the job."

3263,CLI respects server ordering,"It's up to the server to choose the order (based on the -order-by and -desc flags). NOTE: the server, in practice, doesn't respect any of the ordering flags. It only references the COMPLETE_TIME index (in app_operation), and totally ignores module and module options. In practice, this doesn't change any behavior - operations always come in ordered by sequence id, descending. But this opens the door for us to fix this in the server later (or for other server implementations to do this right)."

Note this vulnerability is not in any released Waypoint version, so there is no broad communication necessary. We were not validating the runner token against the runner identity for RunnerJobStream. So long as the token was valid, any runner could request a job impersonating any other runner. This did require that the runner was authenticated already. This adds token verification and a unit test to validate it."

3627,ui: use alternative method to support icons in Percy,"Our previous solution caused a11yAudit to take noticeable longer, due to the presence of a duplicate spritesheet in the page for every single test (documented in link). This patch achieves the same ends, but does the work to include the spritesheet during Percy’s snapshotting procedure. It’s a little more complex, but only applies to the Percy tests and avoids adding redundant sprite sheets to the rest of the suite."

3702,internal/server: Cache Horizon URL Name and Host for Deploy Bundle,"Prior to this commit, when crafting a Deploy bundle, we would include the applications deployment URL for each deployment in the bundle. Looking up this hostname requires making an HTTP request to Horizon. The way this was originally written, we would look up that URL for all requested deployments. If a user had 80+ deployments in the bolt db, this request would take quite some time. Given that each applications deployment vanity name and hostname should be the same, and only differs by the deployment sequence, we don't need to get the hostname for each requested deployment. Instead we can grab it once, and use it for the remaining deployments in the bundle. Fixes #2304"

4255,Implement list runners,"Very basic first implementation of list runners. The immediate need for this is to determine if any remote runners exist, so we can decide if we can execute projects remotely vs locally. This doesn't entirely meet that need - because runners aren't currently marked as remote vs cli, there's no way to tell if a runner is remote, or just some other user who happens to be running a CLI command with a local runner. For my immediate purposes though, that kind of false-positive isn't a dealbreaker. We can add more filter capabilities in the future if we need to."

This is generally ok, however if the Nomad job fails to get started a moment later (like a static runner failing to connect back to Waypoint Server), the runner allocation would exit later but the server install command would consider the installation successful. This commit fixes that by doing a few retries on the scheduled allocation once its in a ""running"" state to ensure it properly started up beyond the first few moments of the job. Fixes #2683"

A full-fidelity solution would include modelling and simulating module, which is one of the largest and most complex protobufs in the system, and therefore more work than is currently justified (in my opinion). As we push further into introspecting data about jobs, I’m pretty confident the situation the time to dive into simulating Job will clearly present itself. Closes #2680"

4349,"support arm64 for the entrypoint, inject properly",This adds a module entrypoint asset to our Waypoint binary. This increases binary size by ~30% but I think this is worthwhile as more of the world's dev and deployment machines move to arm64. This makes it so that Docker entrypoint injection injects the entrypoint binary that matches the architecture and errors if it detects an unsupported architecture. This also adds detection for cloud native buildpacks to warn if the Docker daemon isn't x86_64 since Buildpacks currently have issues with arm64.

4513,Update ember-cli-favicon (#2588),
4514,ui/tests: simplify config var rename test,"This test was brittle (see link) for the following reasons:  All the fixture config vars have random names One of the fixture config vars was dynamic We don’t show the dropdown for dynamic config vars After renaming a config var, we attempt to click the dropdown for the    second item Depending on the number of times faker.hacker.noun has been called    before, the dynamic var could land in that spot Thus, no dropdown and a spuriously failing test  Phew! This patch removes the dynamic config var and the final dropdown click from the test, as neither are material to the behavior under test."

4542,internal/server/state: job creation happens in dependency order,"This does two things: (1) Checks that jobs being created have no cycles between each other. We only need to check ""between each other"" because job creation requires all dependencies already exist. This means that previously created jobs new jobs might depend on can't possibly cycle. Therefore, we only need to check for cycles amongst newly created jobs. (2) Use a topological sort over the dependencies to ensure that we're creating the jobs in the correct order. This allows module to work even if the order of the jobs to run based on deps is module This brings in the module package from go-argmapper, a graph package that is fairly proven at this point; there have been no graph bugs since releasing Waypoint and it has full test coverage."

This can be used along with module to create an ordered chain of jobs that are executed even if a dependency fails. The use case for this is ODR because we want to do the following: module We want ""stop ODR"" to run NO MATTER WHAT to try to stop the launched ODR. We definitely want this to run if the ""real job"" failed, and we probably want it to run even if ""start ODR"" failed just in case we can stop some sort of dangling runner (depends on the error condition). Without this feature, we could only stop ODR if everything succeeded OR force ourselves to maintain external state to call stop ODR. This feature lets us just leverage the job system."

4674,update docs,
4675,Increase failure threshold from 5 to 20.,"Currently, by default, waypoint is timing out the deployment if the pod isn't ready in under a minute. This often isn't enough time, especially for an initial deployment that needs to download a docker image, or for large spring-boot apps that take a while to initialize. Increasing the failure threshold to 30 will increase the timeout to 5 minutes, which should be enough time the majority of apps to pull and start. Users with quick-starting apps (or very slow apps) can change this in their k8s config by modifying pod.container.failure_threshold: https://tip.waypointproject.io/plugins/kubernetes#pod-container-probe-failure_threshold This is a tough balance - it isn't uncommon to deploy an app that won't ever become healthy, and users often won't start investigating until waypoint times out and reports the failure. If we time out sooner, users can start debugging sooner, and they would appreciate that cycle being faster. I think that waypoint giving up too early on a working app is a pretty bad failure mode though - it isn't obvious what the problem is, or how to fix itby changing config."

This is because we don't actually render input variables in the CLI (because we may not have all values). The solution is to move this into a runner operation. We've already started this process with the work we did in 0.6 around InitOp, but we don't yet call this from the CLI. For now, for 0.6, we just disable this init check. This was a safety check anyways and has no practical implications so we can turn it off. We'll turn it back on once we switch to remote operations."

4786,Fix a panic in module,"Previously, module would panic if no profile with a name or ID of foo existed. Panic: ``` » Runner profile: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x38 pc=0x723e9ac] goroutine 1 [running]: github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/internal/cli.(RunnerProfileInspectCommand).Run(0xc000406fe0, 0xc0004356c0, 0x1, 0x4, 0xc000406c30)     /Users/izaak/dev/waypoint/internal/cli/runner_profile_inspect.go:79 +0x62c github.com/mitchellh/cli.(CLI).Run(0xc0009c8000, 0xc000d3fee8, 0x86a8f18, 0xc000435700)     /Users/izaak/go/pkg/mod/github.com/mitchellh/cli@v1.1.2/cli.go:262 +0x41a github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/internal/cli.Main(0xc000435680, 0x5, 0x8, 0x0)     /Users/izaak/dev/waypoint/internal/cli/main.go:126 +0x57a main.main()     /Users/izaak/dev/waypoint/cmd/waypoint/main.go:14 +0xa5 ``` This fixes that panic by having the server return a ""not found"" error on OnDemandRunnerGet. It looks like it was intentional that it returned ""nil"" previously if not found, but this makes the behavior consistent with other API responses like module. Also some incidental typo fixes."

This implementation feels ok to me, but it very well might be too clever/esoteric, and i'm open to just doing it the longform way if anyone hates this."

Provide some small grace period on pod cleanup to allow for the    potential of debugging the failed pods directly.

This ended up in behavior that worked as ""intended"" in this broken case: sometimes you'd get workspace-scoped prioritizing over non-workspace-scoped and vice versa. This clarifies the resolution to note that a variable with a workspace set takes higher priority over one without a variable set, and encodes this rule into the sort logic. This also adds tests for this."

This makes the initial installation login experience smoother cause most installations can just do: $ waypoint login  And it'll just work, rather than looking up the port, which is most likely 9701."

In the scenario where a job is blocked (defined below), peek would return nil which broke the on-demand runner use case that used peek to verify a job exists for a runner. A job is ""blocked"" when another job is already assigned for the same module tuple.

This means if you refresh a refresh for a project view, all of that projects applications will be refreshed. If you request a single app, only that app will be refreshed, etc."

5791,Fix doc string for which platforms we can server install to,
5792,cli/uninstall: Add more validation to requested platform for uninstall,"Prior to this commit, the CLI uninstall command assumed that the platform requested matched the server platform. This could be confusing if a user has both a docker platform server and a local server from module. This commit adds some extra validation with the platform requested by loading the server platform and taking into account what platform was requested. This commit also changes the hard requirement that the uninstall command needs a platform flag. If a server context has a platform set, and no platform flag was requested, use that platform instead. Note that the platform flag, if requested, always overrides what the server context has. This is because some early versions of Waypoint do not set the Platform context. If the flag and server platform conflift, we'll print a note to say we're honoring the platform flag requested. Fixes #2046"

5822,builtin/docker: Close UX loop for generating status reports,"This commit closes the UI loop for when the docker platform is generating status reports for its resources.

If circle-ci was under heavy load and was slow, our requirement that a single poll job would exist would never be satisfied due to project polling likely starting up in the test server. This commit fixes that by only looking at jobs with the specific singleton id when testing this functionality. Fixes #2017"

5929,Not passing declared resources into status funcs.,"We only ever needed this to map from resources to declared resources, but we can now do that based on resource names. Also, any resource state that a plugin cares about should be on it's internal state proto, so it shouldn't ever need anything from the declared resource."

Redacting env vars from stateJson to not expose secrets Better backwards compat Also using new ByName helper func to find declared resources Stripping leading ""/"" from docker container name. Turns out docker containers have a leading / when they on the local docker daemon: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6705 Status report protobuf tweaks  Deprecating resources_health - we don't appear to be using it. Deprecating fields on status report Health that have never been used. Switching DeclaredResourceRef to use name instead of id - turns out name is unique. Introducing a new ""type"" on declaredResource - I thought we could encode ""type"" into this name field, but no dice. Adding a missing Health type for status report resources, which lets us match the sdk proto.  plugin/docker: handling missing container Converting plugin -> server declared resources with mapstructure A field name changed, and doing it this way makes it easier to stay in sync in the future. Copying everything from the sdk status report to the server status report Updating test with field name changes Reorder imports Adding docker container IP address. It's not the most useful thing for local docker in particular, but i'm going to try adding it consistently for every resource that has an IP, so that one day we can expose it easily in the UI. Also some better comments Only using docker container info if it's present Also improved handling for missing contiainers Use the safe container name ContainerInfo isn't safe to use down there. Using status error instead of vanilla error Upgrading waypoint-plugin-sdk for real I thought main was up to date, but the changes I need are still in a branch. I think I made this mistake all through a very long rebase, so I should probalby just squash this whole thing before merging. Unbreaking backwards compat on protobufs. I should have seen this one coming. Introducing a new nested Health message broke compat on the existing health field. I've fixed it by introducing a new field and deprecating the old one. We didn't use it."

6006,cli/project_apply: Return error if polling requested but no data source,This commit adds some extra error messaging if a user requests to enable project or app status polling without specifying the data source of the project. Being explicit here ensures that app polling is only turned on with the projects data source is git since neither of these polling features work with local data sources.

6832,Not embedding hclConfig as a pointer.,"This addresses the panic within https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1704. The problem here is that, if you embed a pointer to a private struct, and the private struct is nil, the caller has no way to determine if the embedded struct's values are safe to access. This manifests here: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/main/internal/cli/base.go#L253 There is no way to determine of c.cfg.Runner is safe to access. A simplified example of the problem: https://play.golang.org/p/sbAPT2HGJqW I believe so - we don't have any methods on hclConfig that require it to be a pointer. We also never statefully maniuplate it outside of the context of module, as far as I can see. I've tested this locally and it doesn't seem to break anything."

6872,config/funcs: template functions to return valid ArgError values,"The template functions are all defined with a variadic parameter to collect zero or more ""vars"" maps, but that means we need to be careful to handle the case where there are no vars maps at all. This code seems to have originally been derived from Terraform's ""templatefile"" which has a non-variadic ""vars"", and so Terraform was correct to assume that argument 1 would always be present. Since Waypoint's version allows omitting it, we'll handle that situation by putting the ""blame"" on the template argument instead, to suggest that it's invalid to refer to any variables inside a template call that doesn't have any variables. The previous incorrect result was originally a panic due to violating the contract HCL expects for function.ArgError, although later versions of HCL handle it by just returning a less-specific error message in that case. This fix therefore boils down to just highlighting a more specific part of the input in the error message HCL will ultimately return."

6961,"Unimplemented status report ""Unknown Status"" -> ""n/a""","Previously, if a plugin does not return status reports, we would say ""Unknown Status"", which is a bit wordy and also conflicts with the ""UNKNOWN"" official status, where a plugin has tried to get status and is explicitly returning unknown. ""n/a"" kind of implies that the very concept of health doesn't apply to some deployments, which isn't right either, but it's the least-worst thing I can think of."

We'll probably need to enhance that pretty soon as we build up more report types and volume. Also it looks like this is a big protobuf diff. The existing generated code has ""unknown"" protobuf version, so i'm not sure what version I need to revert to to make it match."

Renaming module to module also makes us more consistent with waypoint-plugin-sdk.

7233,refactor: add workspace to config.Config,
7234,feat(internal/config): add workspace variable,"This commit adds the ${workspace} variable, so that one can have a single module file deployed across multiple workspaces (e.g: multi-branch gitops repo) and merge easily the module files without having to worry about a branch-dependant variable. ```hcl project = ""waypoint-workspace-demo"" app ""kibana-xyz"" {     build {         use ""docker-pull"" {             image = ""kibana""             tag   = ""latest""         }     } module } ``` This change is probably also useful for Kubernetes and Nomad, as you could have a 1:1 mapping between Waypoint workspaces and Kubernetes / Nomad namespaces. Since it's provided as a variable, the possibilities are endless."

7541,"k8s: add more options, rename PORT env to WAYPOINT_EXPOSED_PORT","This commit adds the possibility to specify new config elements in the HCL file. With these additions is now possible to define a module block that can be used to specify:  module module  In addition to this change, PodSecurityContext now supports the module option. This commit additionally adds a (maybe controversial?) change.

7546,internal/core: render all output variables for destroy phases,"This builds on #1254 which wasn't quite complete it turns out... We need to also ensure that we render all the variables for workspace destruction and ""destroy all"" operations. This also changes the behavior slightly so that we render the Waypoint config using variables based on the latest deploy or release. Previously, we'd use the deploy/release we were destroying. The issue is that the configuration we have at the moment is only the current config, so you could get waypoint.hcl parse errors if they used variables that didn't exist at one point or another. Practically, I'd like to update the SDK docs to note that during a destroy operation you only have the config for the current config rather than a point-in-time configuration. You should persist all state you need onto your deployment/release structure. I think that's how all plugins work anyways today but I'll update docs there to be explicit."

8167,cli/exec: Fail back to old search if FindExecInstance unimplemented,"Prior to this commit, the CLI would attempt to use module on the server when searching for deployments. If the cli made a request against an old server version, it would fail with Unimplemented. It would also not surface this error to the user and instead just exit. This commit fixes that by setting the deployment ID and Sequence first, and if the server responds Unimplmenented, it simply returns early instead of setting the Instance ID. It also displays any errors from searching deployments in the case that we get a different error other than unimplemeneted or ResourceExhausted."

If a user called UpsertProject to modify an existing project it'd blow away all their applications. This couldn't be hit in the real world unless the user was using the API directly, since module is the only thing that calls this API and it always registers applications again.

The change then is to wait for the server side to close the stream after the virtual side sends it's exit code. This means that the server side is in control of seeing the messages and shutting down the stream. We also can now simplify the handling of the ExecStream messages by allowing server.Recv() to return any buffered messages even if the context has already been canceled. Effectively, if we check that the context the server stream is using has been canceled on our own, we don't allow the server stream to return any buffered messages. The entrypoint exec code is also simplified by having it depend only on the execclient/exec side by checking exec.Context for readiness when trying to relay messages back to the execclient."

8304,internal/core: fix test,
8305,internal/cli: Add ability to start an exec plugin for a session,"The semantics here are a bit simplicist but they should work. Basically if there are no instances for a deployment, we try to generate one by using an exec plugin. For platforms that don't have an exec plugin, it will simply error out. A better way to implement this would be to check if the platform supports an exec plugin, and if so only use it. But checking for this fact requires booting the plugin, and booting the plugin requires the runner config, and thus it's just easier to do it this more simplistic way."

8421,internal/runner: step IDs must increment across multiple stepgroups,"Previously, the step ID was calculated based on module which ensured that it was always unique for each new step. But this is only true as long as there is only one step group ever created. In cases where multiple step groups are created, this caused old steps to be reused and it caused some confusing terminal behavior (old lines would be overwritten as the UI framework did its best to update them). This moves the step ID counter to the UI level so it is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing for all steps for that UI."

It is expected that long-running streams such as the log stream will be disconnected periodically due to any number of reasons, but most commonly a load balancer in the middle limiting connection times. In this scenario, we quickly reconnect and its not an issue. It creates too much noise to log every disconnect as an error. However, if we fail to reconnect the log stream, it is an error that should be noted."

Internally, this  changes our state tracking in the CEB to use bools and a condition var. Previously we were using an atomic+channel. This changes the requirement to one shared cond var + bool per state. We aren't using a state enum because these are not mutually exclusive states, we can have both states true at once."

8676,internal/server: fix send-after-close possibility,"I could never reproduce this bug nor write a test for it since it was racey in nature but eyeball-tracing I belive this is the fix. Prior to this change, there was a scenario that could exist where EntrypointExecStream would exit before the recv goroutine. When EntrypointExecStream exited, it would close the event channel that the recv goroutine sends to. If the recv goroutine simultaneously had a message buffered, it could try to send to the closed channel. With this change, we moved the channel close into the recv goroutine. This way there is never a send-after-close possibility. The one important detail is that the event channel MUST ALWAYS be closed when the EntrypointExecStream exits, because closing this channel signals to the client side (typically a CLI) that they should exit prematurely. Therefore, I moved the goroutine start up before we send the Open message. This ensures that in every exit scenario, the goroutine is running, recv should get an EOF, and we'll close the channel."

8873,"send ""EOF"" event for stdin through exec session when stdin is closed","This adds ""EOF"" awareness for stdin to exec so that stdin can be properly closed on the remote side. Without this, some processes would hang indefinitely waiting for stdin to close. For example, if you run module (just normally, not via Waypoint), ls hangs forever since it is waiting for stdin to close. For non-interactive stdout and an interactive stdin, we treat stdin as closed. This seems to align with how other Unix tools treat stdin in this case (such as ls). This change requires a full client, server, entrypoint update to work, but is backwards compatible throughout and just falls back to the same buggy behavior. Fixes #826"

9083,internal/serverinstall: download server image if it doesn't exist,"During module to Docker, this will pull the image if it doesn't exist."
9084,internal/datasource: local data should return pwd,The local datasource needs to return the pwd so that plugin discovery uses an absolute path and doesn't attempt to search by PATH (#691). This also adds validation in internal/runner that this behavior holds.
9085,Updated comment about GitLab images,"Add more context on use GitLab created images, which may not match official checksums."
9086,Merge pull request #694 from alberto/patch-1,Fix typo in docs
9087,Change Image used by GitLab CI/CD,"Instead of downloading the images on every run, GitLab provides regularly updated custom images for Waypoint hosted on GitLab's container registry for every version and the latest version tagged with module."
9088,Fix typo in docs,module -> module
9089,Update ECS plugin for execution and task roles,"In ECS, there are two concepts for IAM roles: the execution role[1], that allows AWS to make API calls on your behalf, to do things like pull images from ECR and write logs to CloudWatch; and the task role[2], that allows the containers within your task access to whatever resources you need them to. Given we almost always need the execution role, it makes sense to have this created by default if it isn't specified. The task role should not be created by default since we have no way to know what the application requires, but we should allow being able to configure it. Initially this commit allows specifying the name of a role created elsewhere. I suspect though that it might be incredibly useful to be able to define which resources your application needs in module, and have a role created with those permissions (maybe with a syntax similar to the Terraform module data source[3]). I've renamed the RoleName to ExecutionRoleName to make explicit what these roles are for.

By specifying module to nil, the original results of the callback function are preserved, because we expect this to NOT be a mapper (or rather: to be a target function) and we want the real original results. This is non-sensible behavior for a single function, so I'm going to follow up with a change to change this behavior into two separate functions."

This is used to deflake our tests and removes a test that would block on my machine like 50% of the time. I ran the test 1000 times on my machine without a failure after this patch. The CEB itself ignores this message and it is unused currently. We could use this message in the future as a timeout mechanism for starting an exec session. If the opened message isn't received in sufficient time, we could end our exec session."
