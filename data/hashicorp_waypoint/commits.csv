369,"Fix bug caused by trying to fix bug related to job ""loss""","TLDR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. The source of all of this is ultimate a 3 year old bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/9d34ba23599142a5b2efbdc7a79c7a4ce163f060/internal/server/singleprocess/service_runner.go#L586 That code used = instead of :=, which caused the goroutine to update the 'primary' job local variable used by everything else in the function. So WHEN (not if, as we'll see in a moment) ctx is canceled, job becomes nil, and any code further down in the function will see than nil DEPENDING on the goroutine scheduling order. So, why would the context be canceled? The goroutine defined right after this does defer cancel() when the client disconnects. So due to the magic of goroutine scheduling, it's possible for the server.Recv() goroutine to exit, canceling the context, then the WatchSet goroutine wakes up, because there is a job change (as we just updated it), causing the loop to start and JobById uses a canceled context. We attempted to figure out WHY the job was nil in the past by adding code into the primary select statement at the bottom of the function, which introduced a second pathology: the WatchSet routine pushed a value onto errCh when it used the canceled context, and the 'job is nil' detection code did a non-blocking read on 'errCh' AFTER it read an event (almostly certainly a Complete event btw). We then saw the error and figured ""oh something is weird and wrong"", so we logged and basically orphaned the Complete event because we had no job record to record things with! TLDidR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug.

This was changed in v0.10.4 with the addition of scoped config sources, and now the ID is a hashed value, whose hash structure is defined by the plugin name, scope, and workspace name. This commit therefore deletes any ""old"" records, those whose ID is the name of any known config sourcer plugin, from Bolt DB, and creates new records with the ID correctly hashed. With this fix, users who had config sources prior to v0.10.3 may continue to interact with those config sources, whereas before this commit, they could not, and the config sources were permanently ""stuck"" in the database as they were before upgrading.",bolt: Fix pre-v0.10.4 config sources.,"This commit updates the Bolt DB implementation of config sources to ""upgrade"" a pre-v0.10.4 database record from the config_source table.

The appconfig system then reads any json-typed variables, dumps the raw json into the ""file"" contents, and returns it to the variable system. The variable system then looks at the type the user specified. If it's a string, it'll assume the plugin returned a string value. If it's a bool or number, it'll error. If it's anything else, it'll try reading the plugin output from the ""file"" as json, and if that works, surface it up the chain as an hcl snippet input variable, which to my great surprise, just works.

This commit fixes that by tracking the step refs as a noop job, then that job depends on all of its embedded jobs before it's complete.

2062,Making keepalive send errors quieter.,"With the old log level, if there's a problem with the server connection, we'd usually log two errors - one for the currently active stream (like RunnerConfig), and also an inline keepalive error. The keepalive error is really just noise for the user in that case, and the client failing to send a keepalive isn't something a user should generally act on, so i'm downgrading this to debug level. I've also noticed this log-erroring sometimes on shutdown. I think it's possible for us to call SendMsg in the keepalive routine after CloseSend has been invoked elsewhere, but before the context is cancelled, which yields us a grpc Internal type error from SendMsg. We could avoid this with more mutexes, but I don't think it's worth the complexity to avoid.",Making keepalive send errors quieter.,"With the old log level, if there's a problem with the server connection, we'd usually log two errors - one for the currently active stream (like RunnerConfig), and also an inline keepalive error.

Some cases where the upstream provider is incompatible with the default name because of limitations on their end make it so that waypoint is unable to be used within those providers. In my testing the DigitalOcean CSI provider doesn't handle capitalization of the volume's name. I suspect other providers may have different requirements which we should be able to work around since there is not an explicit requirement in the CSI spec for the names of volumes within a provider.,core/install: Add --nomad-csi-volume-name flag to install,This commit allows users to specify their own volume names within their CSI provider.

Not much work here since we always designed the runner struct from the beginning to support this so there are no data races. This modifies internal/cli so that runners in non-ODR run in parallel mode by default. ODR doesn't make sense to have any parallelism since they always run exactly one job. Non-ODR runners typically ONLY launch ODR tasks, which are highly IO-bound, so we default to a multiple above CPU count for concurrency. This is a necessary pre-requisite for pipelines since they'll likely perform blocking jobs on the static runners to ""watch"" tasks. Today, tasks are launched and stopped, but not watched so this is not an issue.",runner: static runners accept multiple jobs in parallel,"This modifies internal/runner to support accepting multiple jobs in parallel.

Looking up this hostname requires making an HTTP request to Horizon. The way this was originally written, we would look up that URL for all requested deployments. If a user had 80+ deployments in the bolt db, this request would take quite some time. Given that each applications deployment vanity name and hostname should be the same, and only differs by the deployment sequence, we don't need to get the hostname for each requested deployment. Instead we can grab it once, and use it for the remaining deployments in the bundle.

This is generally ok, however if the Nomad job fails to get started a moment later (like a static runner failing to connect back to Waypoint Server), the runner allocation would exit later but the server install command would consider the installation successful. This commit fixes that by doing a few retries on the scheduled allocation once its in a ""running"" state to ensure it properly started up beyond the first few moments of the job.

This makes it so that Docker entrypoint injection injects the entrypoint binary that matches the architecture and errors if it detects an unsupported architecture.

We definitely want this to run if the ""real job"" failed, and we probably want it to run even if ""start ODR"" failed just in case we can stop some sort of dangling runner (depends on the error condition). Without this feature, we could only stop ODR if everything succeeded OR force ourselves to maintain external state to call stop ODR. This feature lets us just leverage the job system."

Increasing the failure threshold to 30 will increase the timeout to 5 minutes, which should be enough time the majority of apps to pull and start. Users with quick-starting apps (or very slow apps) can change this in their k8s config by modifying pod.container.failure_threshold: https://tip.waypointproject.io/plugins/kubernetes#pod-container-probe-failure_threshold This is a tough balance - it isn't uncommon to deploy an app that won't ever become healthy, and users often won't start investigating until waypoint times out and reports the failure.

6028,cli/uninstall: Add more validation to requested platform for uninstall,"Prior to this commit, the CLI uninstall command assumed that the platform requested matched the server platform. This could be confusing if a user has both a docker platform server and a local server from waypoint server run. This commit adds some extra validation with the platform requested by loading the server platform and taking into account what platform was requested. This commit also changes the hard requirement that the uninstall command needs a platform flag. If a server context has a platform set, and no platform flag was requested, use that platform instead. Note that the platform flag, if requested, always overrides what the server context has. This is because some early versions of Waypoint do not set the Platform context. If the flag and server platform conflift, we'll print a note to say we're honoring the platform flag requested. Fixes #2046",cli/uninstall: Add more validation to requested platform for uninstall,"Prior to this commit, the CLI uninstall command assumed that the platform requested matched the server platform.

7068,Not embedding hclConfig as a pointer.,"This addresses the panic within https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1704. The problem here is that, if you embed a pointer to a private struct, and the private struct is nil, the caller has no way to determine if the embedded struct's values are safe to access. This manifests here: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/main/internal/cli/base.go#L253 There is no way to determine of c.cfg.Runner is safe to access. A simplified example of the problem: https://play.golang.org/p/sbAPT2HGJqW I believe so - we don't have any methods on hclConfig that require it to be a pointer. We also never statefully maniuplate it outside of the context of cfg, as far as I can see. I've tested this locally and it doesn't seem to break anything.",Not embedding hclConfig as a pointer.,"This addresses the panic within link. The problem here is that, if you embed a pointer to a private struct, and the private struct is nil, the caller has no way to determine if the embedded struct's values are safe to access. This manifests here: link There is no way to determine of c.cfg.Runner is safe to access.

Since Waypoint's version allows omitting it, we'll handle that situation by putting the ""blame"" on the template argument instead, to suggest that it's invalid to refer to any variables inside a template call that doesn't have any variables. The previous incorrect result was originally a panic due to violating the contract HCL expects for function.ArgError, although later versions of HCL handle it by just returning a less-specific error message in that case.

Prior to this change, there was a scenario that could exist where EntrypointExecStream would exit before the recv goroutine. When EntrypointExecStream exited, it would close the event channel that the recv goroutine sends to. If the recv goroutine simultaneously had a message buffered, it could try to send to the closed channel. With this change, we moved the channel close into the recv goroutine. This way there is never a send-after-close possibility. The one important detail is that the event channel MUST ALWAYS be closed when the EntrypointExecStream exits, because closing this channel signals to the client side (typically a CLI) that they should exit prematurely. Therefore, I moved the goroutine start up before we send the Open message. This ensures that in every exit scenario, the goroutine is running, recv should get an EOF, and we'll close the channel.",internal/server: fix send-after-close possibility,"I could never reproduce this bug nor write a test for it since it was racey in nature but eyeball-tracing I belive this is the fix.

9109,"send ""EOF"" event for stdin through exec session when stdin is closed","This adds ""EOF"" awareness for stdin to exec so that stdin can be properly closed on the remote side. Without this, some processes would hang indefinitely waiting for stdin to close. For example, if you run cat | ls (just normally, not via Waypoint), ls hangs forever since it is waiting for stdin to close. For non-interactive stdout and an interactive stdin, we treat stdin as closed. This seems to align with how other Unix tools treat stdin in this case (such as ls). This change requires a full client, server, entrypoint update to work, but is backwards compatible throughout and just falls back to the same buggy behavior.

9325,Update ECS plugin for execution and task roles,"In ECS, there are two concepts for IAM roles: the execution role[1], that allows AWS to make API calls on your behalf, to do things like pull images from ECR and write logs to CloudWatch; and the task role[2], that allows the containers within your task access to whatever resources you need them to. Given we almost always need the execution role, it makes sense to have this created by default if it isn't specified. The task role should not be created by default since we have no way to know what the application requires, but we should allow being able to configure it. Initially this commit allows specifying the name of a role created elsewhere. I suspect though that it might be incredibly useful to be able to define which resources your application needs in waypoint.hcl, and have a role created with those permissions (maybe with a syntax similar to the Terraform aws_iam_policy_document data source[3]). I've renamed the RoleName to ExecutionRoleName to make explicit what these roles are for.
