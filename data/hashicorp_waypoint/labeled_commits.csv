93,Adds internal beta messaging to landing page,0.5195726,ui: add workspace switcher to app pages [GH-2674],"TLDR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. The source of all of this is ultimate a 3 year old bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/blob/9d34ba23599142a5b2efbdc7a79c7a4ce163f060/internal/server/singleprocess/service_runner.go#L586 That code used = instead of :=, which caused the goroutine to update the 'primary' job local variable used by everything else in the function. So WHEN (not if, as we'll see in a moment) ctx is canceled, job becomes nil, and any code further down in the function will see than nil DEPENDING on the goroutine scheduling order. So, why would the context be canceled? The goroutine defined right after this does defer cancel() when the client disconnects. So due to the magic of goroutine scheduling, it's possible for the server.Recv() goroutine to exit, canceling the context, then the WatchSet goroutine wakes up, because there is a job change (as we just updated it), causing the loop to start and JobById uses a canceled context. We attempted to figure out WHY the job was nil in the past by adding code into the primary select statement at the bottom of the function, which introduced a second pathology: the WatchSet routine pushed a value onto errCh when it used the canceled context, and the 'job is nil' detection code did a non-blocking read on 'errCh' AFTER it read an event (almostly certainly a Complete event btw). We then saw the error and figured ""oh something is weird and wrong"", so we logged and basically orphaned the Complete event because we had no job record to record things with! TLDidR: calling all the job values 'job' introduced a goroutine-using-outer-scope-variable bug. I've renamed various other job-related variables that held jobs from 'job' to something else to prevent a similar condition in the future.",0

This was changed in v0.10.4 with the addition of scoped config sources, and now the ID is a hashed value, whose hash structure is defined by the plugin name, scope, and workspace name. This commit therefore deletes any ""old"" records, those whose ID is the name of any known config sourcer plugin, from Bolt DB, and creates new records with the ID correctly hashed.

The variable system is requesting it's dynamic default vars as ""files"". The appconfig system then reads any json-typed variables, dumps the raw json into the ""file"" contents, and returns it to the variable system. The variable system then looks at the type the user specified. If it's a string, it'll assume the plugin returned a string value. If it's a bool or number, it'll error. If it's anything else, it'll try reading the plugin output from the ""file"" as json, and if that works, surface it up the chain as an hcl snippet input variable, which to my great surprise, just works. It's not great that we're guessing at what kind of data the plugins returned based on the type that the user specified, but I'm not up for a broader overhaul of the system at this point to wire more type information through.",1

This means downstream jobs could be waiting around to be executing for a while, much longer than 1 minute. This is expected. Given that, this commit updates the server behavior to set a jobs expiry time to something much longer, 60 minutes, and then when the runner goes to accept the job, we update the expiry time to the original expected behavior of 60 seconds, because if the runner has accepted a job to work on, it should run that job fairly quickly like the original intended behavior.",0

Not much work here since we always designed the runner struct from the beginning to support this so there are no data races. This modifies internal/cli so that runners in non-ODR run in parallel mode by default. ODR doesn't make sense to have any parallelism since they always run exactly one job. Non-ODR runners typically ONLY launch ODR tasks, which are highly IO-bound, so we default to a multiple above CPU count for concurrency. This is a necessary pre-requisite for pipelines since they'll likely perform blocking jobs on the static runners to ""watch"" tasks.

Looking up this hostname requires making an HTTP request to Horizon. The way this was originally written, we would look up that URL for all requested deployments. If a user had 80+ deployments in the bolt db, this request would take quite some time. Given that each applications deployment vanity name and hostname should be the same, and only differs by the deployment sequence, we don't need to get the hostname for each requested deployment.

This is generally ok, however if the Nomad job fails to get started a moment later (like a static runner failing to connect back to Waypoint Server), the runner allocation would exit later but the server install command would consider the installation successful. This commit fixes that by doing a few retries on the scheduled allocation once its in a ""running"" state to ensure it properly started up beyond the first few moments of the job. Fixes #2683",0

A full-fidelity solution would include modelling and simulating Job, which is one of the largest and most complex protobufs in the system, and therefore more work than is currently justified (in my opinion). As we push further into introspecting data about jobs, I’m pretty confident the situation the time to dive into simulating Job will clearly present itself. Closes #2680",0

This makes it so that Docker entrypoint injection injects the entrypoint binary that matches the architecture and errors if it detects an unsupported architecture. This also adds detection for cloud native buildpacks to warn if the Docker daemon isn't x86_64 since Buildpacks currently have issues with arm64.,0

4634,Merge pull request #858 from hashicorp/f-docs-template,0.46962202,existing server image is hashicorp/waypoint:latest [GH-3820],"Currently, by default, waypoint is timing out the deployment if the pod isn't ready in under a minute. This often isn't enough time, especially for an initial deployment that needs to download a docker image, or for large spring-boot apps that take a while to initialize. Increasing the failure threshold to 30 will increase the timeout to 5 minutes, which should be enough time the majority of apps to pull and start. Users with quick-starting apps (or very slow apps) can change this in their k8s config by modifying pod.container.failure_threshold: https://tip.waypointproject.io/plugins/kubernetes#pod-container-probe-failure_threshold This is a tough balance - it isn't uncommon to deploy an app that won't ever become healthy, and users often won't start investigating until waypoint times out and reports the failure. If we time out sooner, users can start debugging sooner, and they would appreciate that cycle being faster. I think that waypoint giving up too early on a working app is a pretty bad failure mode though - it isn't obvious what the problem is, or how to fix itby changing config.",0

This could be confusing if a user has both a docker platform server and a local server from waypoint server run. This commit adds some extra validation with the platform requested by loading the server platform and taking into account what platform was requested. This commit also changes the hard requirement that the uninstall command needs a platform flag. If a server context has a platform set, and no platform flag was requested, use that platform instead. Note that the platform flag, if requested, always overrides what the server context has. This is because some early versions of Waypoint do not set the Platform context.

Turns out docker containers have a leading / when they on the local docker daemon: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6705 Status report protobuf tweaks  Deprecating resources_health - we don't appear to be using it. Deprecating fields on status report Health that have never been used. Switching DeclaredResourceRef to use name instead of id - turns out name is unique. Introducing a new ""type"" on declaredResource - I thought we could encode ""type"" into this name field, but no dice. Adding a missing Health type for status report resources, which lets us match the sdk proto.  plugin/docker: handling missing container Converting plugin -> server declared resources with mapstructure A field name changed, and doing it this way makes it easier to stay in sync in the future. Copying everything from the sdk status report to the server status report Updating test with field name changes Reorder imports Adding docker container IP address. It's not the most useful thing for local docker in particular, but i'm going to try adding it consistently for every resource that has an IP, so that one day we can expose it easily in the UI. Also some better comments Only using docker container info if it's present Also improved handling for missing contiainers Use the safe container name ContainerInfo isn't safe to use down there. Using status error instead of vanilla error Upgrading waypoint-plugin-sdk for real I thought main was up to date, but the changes I need are still in a branch. I think I made this mistake all through a very long rebase, so I should probalby just squash this whole thing before merging. Unbreaking backwards compat on protobufs. I should have seen this one coming. Introducing a new nested Health message broke compat on the existing health field. I've fixed it by introducing a new field and deprecating the old one.

This code seems to have originally been derived from Terraform's ""templatefile"" which has a non-variadic ""vars"", and so Terraform was correct to assume that argument 1 would always be present. Since Waypoint's version allows omitting it, we'll handle that situation by putting the ""blame"" on the template argument instead, to suggest that it's invalid to refer to any variables inside a template call that doesn't have any variables. The previous incorrect result was originally a panic due to violating the contract HCL expects for function.ArgError, although later versions of HCL handle it by just returning a less-specific error message in that case. This fix therefore boils down to just highlighting a more specific part of the input in the error message HCL will ultimately return.",0

We need to also ensure that we render all the variables for workspace destruction and ""destroy all"" operations. This also changes the behavior slightly so that we render the Waypoint config using variables based on the latest deploy or release. Previously, we'd use the deploy/release we were destroying. The issue is that the configuration we have at the moment is only the current config, so you could get waypoint.hcl parse errors if they used variables that didn't exist at one point or another. Practically, I'd like to update the SDK docs to note that during a destroy operation you only have the config for the current config rather than a point-in-time configuration. You should persist all state you need onto your deployment/release structure. I think that's how all plugins work anyways today but I'll update docs there to be explicit.",1

The change then is to wait for the server side to close the stream after the virtual side sends it's exit code. This means that the server side is in control of seeing the messages and shutting down the stream. We also can now simplify the handling of the ExecStream messages by allowing server.Recv() to return any buffered messages even if the context has already been canceled. Effectively, if we check that the context the server stream is using has been canceled on our own, we don't allow the server stream to return any buffered messages. The entrypoint exec code is also simplified by having it depend only on the execclient/exec side by checking exec.Context for readiness when trying to relay messages back to the execclient.",0

Prior to this change, there was a scenario that could exist where EntrypointExecStream would exit before the recv goroutine. When EntrypointExecStream exited, it would close the event channel that the recv goroutine sends to. If the recv goroutine simultaneously had a message buffered, it could try to send to the closed channel. With this change, we moved the channel close into the recv goroutine. This way there is never a send-after-close possibility. The one important detail is that the event channel MUST ALWAYS be closed when the EntrypointExecStream exits, because closing this channel signals to the client side (typically a CLI) that they should exit prematurely. Therefore, I moved the goroutine start up before we send the Open message. This ensures that in every exit scenario, the goroutine is running, recv should get an EOF, and we'll close the channel.",0

Without this, some processes would hang indefinitely waiting for stdin to close. For example, if you run cat | ls (just normally, not via Waypoint), ls hangs forever since it is waiting for stdin to close. For non-interactive stdout and an interactive stdin, we treat stdin as closed. This seems to align with how other Unix tools treat stdin in this case (such as ls). This change requires a full client, server, entrypoint update to work, but is backwards compatible throughout and just falls back to the same buggy behavior. Fixes #826",0

Given we almost always need the execution role, it makes sense to have this created by default if it isn't specified. The task role should not be created by default since we have no way to know what the application requires, but we should allow being able to configure it. Initially this commit allows specifying the name of a role created elsewhere. I suspect though that it might be incredibly useful to be able to define which resources your application needs in waypoint.hcl, and have a role created with those permissions (maybe with a syntax similar to the Terraform aws_iam_policy_document data source[3]). I've renamed the RoleName to ExecutionRoleName to make explicit what these roles are for.
