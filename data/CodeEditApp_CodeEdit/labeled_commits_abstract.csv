Enhancement: #218 Fuzzy search for QuickOpen (#1307),0.9133724,Enhancement: #218 Fuzzy search for QuickOpen by @Wouter01 in link,"Added a fuzzy search for QuickOpen searching; Every search result gets a score based on how many queryTokes are found in the file url, the proximity Score, the modifying date and the Levenshtein-Distance. Added better documentation for some of the FuzzySearch functions; Fixed the levenshteinDistance function; Resolved merge conflicts Removed line width warnings; Removed redundant else statement Removed redundant else statement Replaced deprecated methods Delete Icon Removed unnecessary documentation; Resolved the bug, where random files weren't displayed; Spelling mistake corrected; Search Results ignore .git files; Search Results show .git files again; Shortened return statement; Found and fixed the missing files error The problem was the the calculateDateScore function, returned a score of 0.0 for files that were never created or modified by the user(downloaded files for example). The date score got multiplied with the file score, and something times 0.0 equals 0 and consequently the items weren't displayed in the list🤦🏻‍♂️. I simply added score + 0.01 which assigns a default score of 0.01 to each date score. However, there is a disadvantage: the search results are worse...

Branch checkout after cloning (#460),0.36877245,[chore]: CI - update checkout action to v3 by @lukepistrol in link,"Git Clone: Add basic functionality of cloning repository Basics of cloning repository implemented. Pressing clone on welcome view now opens simple window with url input with clone and close buttons For now it clones the repositories in to your home dir. Error handling for now is nada and should be implemented in later commits Git Clone: Select target folder and clone the repository Now you can select the folder to which you want to clone the repository. This defaults to home folder. Also added check that the repository isn't empty when trying to clone. Git Clone: Open cloned folder Now after we press clone button, we firstly clone the specified repository to given folder. After cloning, we open folder picker for the user to pick folder to open the editor in. However this could be better if we straight up open the editor in the cloned folder, rather than giving user an option to choose the folder in between. Git Clone: Add error handling Added error handling for git related errors e.g. when trying to clone non existent repository Git Clone: Implementation as a module Changed GitClone to be module as discussed in link Git Clone: Uncomment dependency from Package.swift Git Clone: Switch to use NSSavePanel Switched the git clone view folder picking to use NSSavePanel instead of NSOpenPanel. NSSavePanel gives us kind of the same flow as Xcode has, as it's also using NSSavePanel to prompt the target folder for cloning. The view now consist of two separate modals that pop open, and it may seem cumbersome, but it now has kind of the same functionality as Xcode. Git Clone: Remove .git only if the url has it. Git Clone: Reposition UI Repositioning buttons, input and text. Also added app icon to the view Git Clone: Change clone view to be sheet Changed git clone view to be sheet instead of normal window. This is better for UX as you can't click anywhere else than the clone view until you either cancel or clone the repository Git Clone: Validate url and more error handling Naive Xcode-like check for the url implemented. For now if the url does not start with certain string, the clone button is disabled, just like in Xcode. Also added check for when user decides to press cancel on folder selection link Git Clone: Add automatic pasting If you have 'valid' git url in your clipboard when opening the clone view, it now automatically pastes it to the textfield GitClone: Fix some force unwrappings and make vars private GitClone: Make shellClient constant GitClone: Fix indentation and make logic private func Fixed indentation in WelcomeView and moved the logic of cloning repository into it's own private function GitClone: Add CheckoutBranchModal Added modal to checkout to other branches after cloning the repository GitClone: Make checkout button defaultAction GitClone: Add possibility to checkout to remote branches Showing all branhes to make it possible to checkout to remote branches as well as local GitClone: Make the modal wider GitClone: Open checkout branch modal only if there's multiple branches GitClone: Refactor extension to separate file.",0

Add functionality for cloning from git in welcome view (#232),0.43644446,Update Clone From label in Account Preferences by @MrDevel0per in link,"Git Clone: Add basic functionality of cloning repository Basics of cloning repository implemented. Pressing clone on welcome view now opens simple window with url input with clone and close buttons For now it clones the repositories in to your home dir. Error handling for now is nada and should be implemented in later commits Git Clone: Select target folder and clone the repository Now you can select the folder to which you want to clone the repository. This defaults to home folder. Also added check that the repository isn't empty when trying to clone. Git Clone: Open cloned folder Now after we press clone button, we firstly clone the specified repository to given folder. After cloning, we open folder picker for the user to pick folder to open the editor in. However this could be better if we straight up open the editor in the cloned folder, rather than giving user an option to choose the folder in between. Git Clone: Add error handling Added error handling for git related errors e.g. when trying to clone non existent repository Git Clone: Implementation as a module Changed GitClone to be module as discussed in link Git Clone: Uncomment dependency from Package.swift Git Clone: Switch to use NSSavePanel Switched the git clone view folder picking to use NSSavePanel instead of NSOpenPanel. NSSavePanel gives us kind of the same flow as Xcode has, as it's also using NSSavePanel to prompt the target folder for cloning. The view now consist of two separate modals that pop open, and it may seem cumbersome, but it now has kind of the same functionality as Xcode. Git Clone: Remove .git only if the url has it. Git Clone: Reposition UI Repositioning buttons, input and text. Also added app icon to the view Git Clone: Change clone view to be sheet Changed git clone view to be sheet instead of normal window. This is better for UX as you can't click anywhere else than the clone view until you either cancel or clone the repository Git Clone: Validate url and more error handling Naive Xcode-like check for the url implemented. For now if the url does not start with certain string, the clone button is disabled, just like in Xcode. Also added check for when user decides to press cancel on folder selection link Git Clone: Add automatic pasting If you have 'valid' git url in your clipboard when opening the clone view, it now automatically pastes it to the textfield GitClone: Fix some force unwrappings and make vars private GitClone: Make shellClient constant GitClone: Fix indentation and make logic private func Fixed indentation in WelcomeView and moved the logic of cloning repository into it's own private function",0
